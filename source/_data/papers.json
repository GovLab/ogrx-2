    "abstract":"Smart cities are associated almost exclusively with modern technology and infrastructure. However, smart cities have the possibility to enhance the involvement and contribution of citizens to urban development. This work explores the role of governance as one of the factors influencing the participation of citizens in smart cities projects. Governance characteristics play a major role in explaining different typologies of citizen participation. Through a focus on Amsterdam Smart City program as a specific case study, this research examines the characteristics of governance that are present in the overall program and within a selected sample of projects, and how they relate to different typologies of citizen participation. The analysis and comprehension of governance characteristics plays a crucial role both for a better understanding and management of citizen participation, especially in complex settings where multiple actors are interacting."},

Using data from a large randomised field experiment of Community-Led Total Sanitation in Indonesia, we find that villages with high initial social capital built toilets and reduced open defecation, resulting in substantial health benefits. In villages with low initial stocks of social capital, the approach was counterproductive – fewer toilets were built than in control communities and social capital suffered."},{"id":"c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"Why a Nudge is Not Enough: A social identity critique of governanceby stealth","organization":[""],"authors":["Frank Mols","S.

The storage and analysis of this information benefits society, as it enables relevant agencies to make better informed decisions and to address the individual's needs more appropriately. Members of the public often assume that the authorities are well equipped to handle personal data; however, due to implementation errors and lack of data governance, this is not always the case. This paper reports on an audit conducted in Western Australia, focusing on findings in the Police Firearms Management System and the Department of Health Information System. In the case of the Police, the audit revealed numerous data protection issues leading the auditors to report that they had no confidence in the accuracy of information on the number of people licensed to possess firearms or the number of licensed firearms. Similarly alarming conclusions were drawn in the Department of Health as auditors found that they could not determine which medical staff member was responsible for clinical data entries made. The paper describes how these issues often do not arise from existing business rules or the technology itself, but a lack of sound data governance. Finally, a discussion section presents key data governance principles and best practices that may guide practitioners involved in data management. These cases highlight the very real data management concerns, and the associated recommendations provide the context to spark further interest in the applied aspects of data protection."},{"id":"a87ff679a2f3e71d9181a67b7542122c","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"The Individiualisation of Party Politics: The Impact of Changing Internal Decision-Making Processes on Policy Development and Citizen Engagement","organization":[""],"authors":["Anika Gauja"],"paper_date":"12/23/2013","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-856X.12035/full?utm_content=buffer3baa6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Participation"],"methodology":["Case Studies","Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":["Politics"],"region":["Australia","Europe"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This article examines the changing nature of the connection between citizens, party members and elites in the creation of party policy through the theoretical prism of individualisation.

It has also been lauded as enabling energy companies to demonstrate their responsibility and sustainability, enabling countries to attract more foreign investment, and enabling communities to engage in dialogue with national planners over energy issues. In this paper, we ask: does it work? Do countries adhering to EITI standards actually see selected governance metrics improve? To answer this question, this article first briefly summarizes the history of the EITI and details the hypothetical benefits espoused by its supporters. It then proceeds to “test” these benefits by qualitatively assessing the performance of EITI for the first two countries to achieve candidacy, Azerbaijan and Liberia. The paper finds that while the EITI affirms the salience of reliable information and data about the extractive industries, it is difficult to attribute governance improvements casually to the EITI. Moreover, the EITI reveals an inherent paradox about the virtues of transparency and also underscores that much of the damage from mining and hydrocarbon development is socially and economically unavoidable. \n\nDoes transparency matter?

We introduce three mobility indicators (daily activity range, number of activity anchor points, and frequency of movements) to represent the major determinants of individual activity space. By applying association rules in data mining, we analyze how these indicators of an individual's activity space can be combined with each other to gain insights of mobility patterns in these two cities.

Our results reveal some distinctive characteristics of human activity space in these two cities: (1) A high percentage of people in Shenzhen have a relatively short daily activity range, whereas people in Shanghai exhibit a variety of daily activity ranges; (2) people with more than one activity anchor point tend to travel further but less frequently in Shanghai than in Shenzhen; (3) Shenzhen shows a significant north–south contrast of activity space that reflects its urban structure; and (4) travel distance in both cities is shorter around noon than in regular work hours, and a large percentage of movements around noon are associated with individual home locations.

PB is a process that intends to drive change with specific outcomes: through deliberative decision-making, ordinary citizens select well-being- and agency-enhancing projects that ideally lead to more local and authentic development. Together with the attainment of these tangible outcomes, valuable subjective states may also come about: people feel more in charge of their own lives, community groups become more collaborative and cooperative, and more and better democracy is fostered. Taking a step forward from previous studies that only focus on PB from an urban planning or public finance perspective, the overall objective of this study is to provide a deeper understanding and assessment of how PB works in the localities under analysis, its association with different measures of agency, the characteristics that drive its success or failure, and its general impact on the lives of individuals and communities. Drawing on normative and policy-based literatures and specifically following an agency-oriented capability approach, this study uses a mixed-methods approach to analyze interview, survey, and direct observations of PB public assemblies, and archival data with respect to the 2013 budget cycle in four DR municipalities. A regression analysis finds that participation in and awareness of PB are both significantly correlated with individuals reporting higher levels of individual and collective agency when compared to non-participants and unaware individuals. These measures of agency are contextualized to the municipal budget-planning cycle. A process tracing analysis concludes that PB is likely, under certain conditions, to increase democratic participation and deliberation. However, due to certain democratic deficits, PB in two DR municipalities does not always increase agency, group cooperative functioning, and good development. Thus, PB must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis because differences in the characteristics of each PB assembly may lead to different outcomes. It is finally argued that rather than condemning democracy because of the failures of the current PB system, we should advance PB's democracy further by improving it in various ways."},{"id":"1f0e3dad99908345f7439f8ffabdffc4","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"Collaborative approaches to public sector innovation: A scoping study","organization":[""],"authors":["K.

Despite of its increasing availability, its level of adoption has not been satisfying. On the other hand, over the last years, coinciding with the web 2.0 trend, the e-government services co-produced by citizens start to appear, often without the support, acknowledgement and even awareness of the government. This trend stems from a well-established tradition of offline co- production of public services, i.e. services provided by the voluntary sector, but brought to an unprecedented scale thanks to the advent of web 2.0. Still, the concept remains not well-defined and its impact is not yet well studied. The paper explores on a limited sets of cases what does it mean to collaboratively deliver online public services; what are the success factors based on the cases under study and what are the incentives for service providers (other than public administration), citizens as users and public administration. The authors propose an ostensive definition of the collaborative delivery of public services: collaborative public services are created and run by government, civil society or by private sector building on the re-use of government data or citizens data. Those services are focused on public goods delivery (e.g. health, education, public transport) and are meant to change the traditional government services by engaging in an open dialogue with public administration about the best way to deliver those services. The analysis of six case studies of innovative collaborative online public services suggests that the online collaborative public service delivery increases its quality with the users׳ growth contrary to the traditional offline service delivery. The study results indicate that the current developers interest lies in delivering complementary services to the government run services rather than substitutive services. The authors propose also the initial list of success factors, enabling conditions, and benefits for all main stakeholders (users, innovators and public administration)."},{"id":"98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"Open governance systems: Doing more with more","organization":[""],"authors":["Jeremy Millard"],"paper_date":"9/12/2015","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X15300034","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Open Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":[""],"region":["Europe"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This paper tackles many of the important issues and discussions taking place in Europe and globally about the future of the public sector and how it can use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to respond innovatively and effectively to some of the acute societal challenges arising from the financial crisis as well as other deeper rooted global problems. These include inequality, poverty, corruption and migration, as well as climate change, loss of habitat and the ageing society. A conceptual framework for open governance systems enabled by ICT is proposed, drawing on evidence and examples from around the world as well as a critical appraisal of both academic and grey literature. The framework constructs a system of open assets, open services and open engagement, and this is used to move the e-government debate forward from a preoccupation with lean and small governments which ‘do more with less’ to examine the potential for open governance systems to also ‘do more with more’. This is achieved by enabling an open government and open public sector, as part of this open governance system, to ‘do more by leveraging more’ of the existing assets and resources across the whole of society, and not just within the public sector, many of which are unrealised and untapped, so in effect are ‘wasted’. The paper argues that efficiencies and productivity improvements are essential at all levels and across all actors, as is maximising both public and private value, but that they must also be seen at the societal level where trade-offs and interactions are required, and not only at the individual actor level."},{"id":"3c59dc048e8850243be8079a5c74d079","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"True Collective Intelligence?

In order to empower the role of citizen in this context, we propose an approach that relies on the establishment of a physical and intellectual space for shared understanding and collaboration between all stakeholders impacted by an environmental problem (in our case odour emission). Based on the development of an Information Technology (IT) system allowing odour emission measurement as well as the collection of citizen feedback, a Living Lab (LL) approach is being implemented that involves citizens, public authorities, industry and environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs). According to the definition of the European commission, Living Labs are “open innovation environments in real-life settings, in which userdriven innovation is fully integrated within the co-creation process of new services, products and societal infrastructures”. Based on this definition and considering, in our case, citizens as one of the end-users of the IT system, we argue that such an approach will empower their role in local environmental governance. This article presents the method and techniques that will be used in order to set up such a Living Lab. More precisely, we focus here on the first step of this method: defining the components that will support the management of a Living Lab relying on an IT system. This step consists in the identification of the Living Lab stakeholders (citizen, industry, public authorities, NGOs, etc.), including their characteristics, fears, expectations, involvement and engagement regarding the Living Lab. To do this, 2 main approaches are being combined: A Living Lab approach that aims to involve citizens in local Environmental Governance (LEG) design. Use of Human-Centred Design (HCD), to combine IT developments and LL needs, for example Personas methodology and usability test. A Living Lab relies mainly on stakeholders’ involvement in order to build trust and establish a common goal. In this sense, sociologists’ approaches ((Akrich et al. 2006);) bring valuable information on how to mobilise different actors in order to innovate (Actor Network Theory). However, in the innovation process, these approaches are only considering human actors and do not take into account any technological aspects. However, if Living Labs are relying on human actors’ interactions it should also take into account their interactions with the IT system it is based on. In this case, HumanCentred Design (HCD) being an approach that aims to make IT systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, is to be considered as complementary to the sociologists approaches. This article, based on the work performed in the FP7 European project OMNISCIENTIS, presents the theoretical context in which this study takes place as well as the overall methodology."},{"id":"33e75ff09dd601bbe69f351039152189","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Online Participation in Higher Education Decision-making","organization":[""],"authors":["Samuel Bohman","Henrik Hansson","Pooyeh Mobini"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://www.jedem.org/index.php/jedem/article/view/247","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Legitimacy","Participation"],"methodology":["Case Studies","Survey"]},"sector":["Education"],"region":["Europe"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This article considers online participation in higher education decision-making using the MyUniversity EU project as a case study.

Less is known about the effectiveness of these sites as a method for collecting data for health research and the means to use such powerful tools in health research.\nObjective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the available literature and explore the use of SNS as a mode of collecting data for health research. The review aims to answer four questions: Does health research employ SNS as method for collecting data? Is data quality affected by the mode of data collection? What types of participants were reached by SNS? What are the strengths and limitations of SNS?\nMethods: The literature was reviewed systematically in March 2013 by searching the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, using the Ovid and PubMed interface from 1996 to the third week of March 2013. The search results were examined by 2 reviewers, and exclusion, inclusion, and quality assessment were carried out based on a pre-set protocol.\nResults: The inclusion criteria were met by 10 studies and results were analyzed descriptively to answer the review questions. There were four main results. (1) SNS have been used as a data collection tool by health researchers; all but 1 of the included studies were cross-sectional and quantitative. (2) Data quality indicators that were reported include response rate, cost, timeliness, missing data/completion rate, and validity. However, comparison was carried out only for response rate and cost as it was unclear how other reported indicators were measured. (3) The most targeted population were females and younger people. (4) All studies stated that SNS is an effective recruitment method but that it may introduce a sampling bias.\nConclusions: SNS has a role in health research, but we need to ascertain how to use it effectively without affecting the quality of research. The field of SNS is growing rapidly, and it is necessary to take advantage of the strengths of this tool and to avoid its limitations by effective research design. This review provides an important insight for scholars who plan to conduct research using SNS."},{"id":"182be0c5cdcd5072bb1864cdee4d3d6e","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"The Decalogue of Policy Making 2.0: Results from Analysis of Case Studies \non the Impact of ICT for Governance and Policy Modelling","organization":[""],"authors":["Sotirios Koussouris","Fenareti Lampathaki","Gianluca Misuraca","Panagiotis Kokkinakos","Dimitrios Askounis"],"paper_date":"8/30/2014","url":"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-08081-9_10","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Civic Technology"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Participation"],"methodology":["Case Studies","Comparative Analysis"]},"sector":[""],"region":["Europe"],"type":"book-chapter","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Despite the availability of a myriad of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) based tools and methodologies for supporting governance and the formulation of policies, including modelling expected impacts, these have proved to be unable to cope with the dire challenges of the contemporary society.

Additional psychological constructs (such as subjects' awareness that they were revealing personal information) were also recorded, and a demographic analysis according to gender, age, education and country of residence carried out."},{"id":"a5771bce93e200c36f7cd9dfd0e5deaa","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Privacy, Security and Data Protection in Smart Cities: a Critical EU Law Perspective","organization":[""],"authors":["Lilian Edwards"],"paper_date":"12/15","url":"http://zenodo.org/record/34501/files/CREATe-Working-Paper-2015-11.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis","Smart Cities"],"objective":["Legitimacy","Privacy"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":[""],"region":["Europe"],"type":"working-paper","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This paper, drawing on author engagement with smart city development in Glasgow as well as the results of an international conference in the area curated by the author, argues that smart cities combine the three greatest current threats to personal privacy, with which regulation has so far failed to deal effectively; the Internet of Things(IoT) or \"ubiquitous computing\"; \"Big Data\" ; and the Cloud.

This result circumvents previous prohibitive lower bounds and is surprisingly strong: even if the number of ideas is as large as the number of participants, each participant will only have to make a logarithmic number of comparisons, an expo- nential improvement over the linear number of compar- isons previously needed. Second, we apply these ideas to Finland’s recent off-road traffic law reform, an ex- periment on participatory democracy in real life. This allows us to verify the scaling predicted in our theory and show that the constant involved is also not large.

It is therefore of central concern to establish whether crowdsourcing can actually help restore political legitimacy by creating more positive attitudes toward the political system. This article contributes to this research agenda by examining the developments in attitudes among the users on the Finnish website Avoin Ministeriö (“Open Ministry”) which orchestrates crowdsourcing of legislation by providing online tools for deliberating ideas for citizens' initiatives. The developments in attitudes are investigated with a two-stage survey of 421 respondents who answered questions concerning political and social attitudes, as well as political activities performed.

Following information infrastructure studies, this communication aims to question the modes of existence of raw data in administrations. Drawing on an ethnography of open government data projects in several French administrations, it shows that data are not ready-at-hand resources. Indeed, three kinds of operations are conducted that progressively instantiate open data. The first one is exploration. Where are, and what are, the data within the institution are tough questions, the response to which entails organizational and technical inquiries. The second one is extraction. Data are encapsulated in databases and its release implies a sometimes complex disarticulation process. The third kind of operations is ‘rawification’. It consists in a series of tasks that transforms what used to be indexical professional data into raw data. To become opened, data are (re)formatted, cleaned, ungrounded. Though largely invisible, these operations foreground specific ‘frictions’ that emerge during the sociotechnical shaping of transparency, even before data publication and reuses."},{"id":"d9d4f495e875a2e075a1a4a6e1b9770f","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Habermas and the Garants : Narrowing the gap between policy and practice in French organisation – citizen engagement","organization":[""],"authors":["Judy Burnside-Lawry","Carolyne Lee","Sandrine Rui"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://mams.rmit.edu.au/axlu02i2337i1.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Participation"],"methodology":["Case Studies"]},"sector":["Transportation"],"region":["France"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This article draws on a case study of organisation–citizen engagement during railway infrastructure planning in southwest France, to examine the nature of participatory democracy, both conceptually—as elucidated by Habermas and others—and empirically, as recently practised within the framework of a model established in one democratically governed country.

Focusing on the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews and content analysis, it argues that this process leads activists to develop new rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied publics. Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a prerequisite for generating knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should break the interpretative monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation of data about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and flexible form of representative democracy by applying the open source model of participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermediaries are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an interest in transforming journalism to become an intermediary in this sense. At the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting that the practices and ideas of open data activists are relevant because they illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors outside big government and big business."},{"id":"642e92efb79421734881b53e1e1b18b6","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Opening Public Transit Data in Germany","organization":[""],"authors":["Stefan Kaufmann"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://dbis.eprints.uni-ulm.de/1054/1/Kaufmann2014.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Access","Legitimacy"],"methodology":["Survey"]},"sector":["Transportation"],"region":["Germany"],"type":"thesisdissertation","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Open data has been recognized as a valuable resource, and public institutions have taken to publishing their data under open licenses, also in Germany.

A new paradigm that signifies a shift to citizen-driven initiatives over and above state- and market-centric ones calls for innovative thinking that requires openness in government. The need for this new synergy notwithstanding, Open Government cannot be considered truly open unless it also enhances citizen participation and engagement. The Ghana Open Data Initiative (GODI) project strives to create an open data community that will enable government (supply side) and civil society in general (demand side) to exchange data and information.

Beyond typical administrative reforms, innovation is expected to help address societal challenges such as the aging population, inclusion, health care, education, public safety, environment and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The public sector consists of a complex open system of organizations with various tasks. Therefore, decision-making can be slower than in the private sector because of large chains of command. Innovations here will often have an impact across this complex organizational structure, and thus must be supported by a robust strategy. To strengthen democracy, promote government efficiency and effectiveness, discourage wastes and misuses of government resources, public administrations have to promote a new stronger level of openness in government. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe an innovative approach for the governance of public systems and services, currently applied in the Italian public administration domain, which could be easily replicated in other countries as well. Two initiatives, to collect and provide relevant public information gathered from different and heterogeneous public organizations, to improve government processes and increase quality of services for citizens and companies, are described. The cases adopted have been validated through a Case Studies approach involving the Italian Agency for the public administration digitalization to understand new e-government scenarios within the context of governmental reforms heavily influenced by the principles of Open Government Model."},{"id":"66f041e16a60928b05a7e228a89c3799","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Assessing Social Value in Open Data Initiatives: A Framework","organization":[""],"authors":["Gianluigi Viscusi","Marco Castelli","Carlo Batini"],"paper_date":"8/19/2014","url":"http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/6/3/498/htm","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Access","Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":[""],"region":["Italy","United Kingdom","Tunisia"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Open data initiatives are characterized, in several countries, by a great extension of the number of data sets made available for access by public administrations, constituencies, businesses and other actors, such as journalists, international institutions and academics, to mention a few.

Several experiences and reports confirm this issue, such as those of the Open Data Census. However, there are also relevant best practices. The goal of this paper is to investigate the different dimensions of a framework suitable to support public administrations, as well as constituencies, in assessing and benchmarking the social value of open data initiatives. The framework is tested on three initiatives, referring to three different countries, Italy, the United Kingdom and Tunisia. The countries have been selected to provide a focus on European and Mediterranean countries, considering also the difference in legal frameworks (civic law vs. common law countries)."},{"id":"093f65e080a295f8076b1c5722a46aa2","related_content":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j07Vr1eXWmE","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Why women participate less in civic activity: Evidence from Mali ","organization":[""],"authors":["Jessica Gottlieb"],"paper_date":"8/14/2014","url":"http://www.gsdrc.org/go/display&type=Document&id=5809&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gsdrc&utm_source=newsfeed","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Case Studies"]},"sector":[""],"region":["Mali"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This paper finds that a randomly assigned civic education course in Mali widened the gender gap, when it increased civic activity among men while decreasing that among women.

Taking advantage of the opportunities offered by social media is not limited to central government. Local governments deploy internet-based innovative technologies that complement traditional methods in implementing different functions. This book focuses on the relationship between the local governments and social media, deals with the change that social media have caused in the organization, understanding of service provision, performance of local governments and in the relationships between local governments and their partners, and aims to advance our theoretical and empirical understanding of the growing use of social media by local governments. This book will be of interest to researchers and students in e-government, public administration, political science, communication, information science, and social media.

It shows that government's higher education database is a closed and isolated data source in the data ecosystem; and that the open data that are made available by government is inaccessible and rarely used. In contrast, government data made available by data intermediaries in the ecosystem are being used by key stakeholders. Intermediaries are found to play several important roles in the ecosystem: (i) they increase the accessibility and utility of data; (ii) they may assume the role of a “keystone species” in a data ecosystem; and (iii) they have the potential to democratize the impacts and use of open data.

Perceived risks of retribution and intimidation for expressing a particular opinion or supporting a political cause mean that citizen-to-citizen participation is the predominant form but still at low levels, while citizen-to-government participation is negligible."},{"id":"35f4a8d465e6e1edc05f3d8ab658c551","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Crowdsourcing as a tool for political participation? – the case of Ugandawatch","organization":[""],"authors":["Johan Hellström"],"paper_date":"2015","url":"http://www.ijpis.net/ojs/index.php/IJPIS/article/view/131/pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Civic Technology"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Survey"]},"sector":[""],"region":["Uganda"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Uganda has democratic deficits where demand for democracy exceeds its supply. As a consequence it is argued that a segment of Ugandans might participate and honour the freedom to speak out, assemble, and associate given new opportunities outside the traditional political channels. With expanded mobile coverage and access to mobile devices and services in mind, and using the concept of open crowdsourcing, the platform UgandaWatch was launched prior to the 2011 general elections with the intention to meet the demand, to offer increased equality of political participation, and to advance efforts toward increased citizen engagement in Uganda. From a community informatics point of view, the study examined how and under what conditions access to ICT tools (mobile devices, networks, and a crowdsourcing platform) can be made usable and useful for people and communities for increased political participation in a given context. By combining the collection and analysis of quantitative (SMS-survey) and qualitative data (focus groups) through a mixed-method approach, this study answers the questions, What are the key factors that influence users’ willingness to use mobile phones and crowdsourcing platforms as a channel for political participation?, and What concerns do users have with respect to using mobile phones and crowdsourcing platforms in the participation process? The study shows that users participated because they hoped it would bring real change to Uganda’s electoral and political landscape, that it was a convenient channel to use (quick and easy) and that confidentiality was assured. The user concerns relate to costs, trust, and safety. Crowdsourcing offers an alternative channel and may substitute or supplement traditional means of political participation. It can increase participation in some groups, including among those who normally do not participate—something that increases equality of political participation in a positive direction."},{"id":"d1fe173d08e959397adf34b1d77e88d7","related_content":[{"url":"http://www.nesta.org.uk/project/collective-intelligence","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Collective Intelligence in Patient Organisations","organization":[""],"authors":["Lydia Nicholas","Stefana Broadbent"],"paper_date":"7/1/2015","url":"http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/collective-intelligence-patient-organisations","taxonomy":{"category":["Expert Networking","Collective Intelligence"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Case Studies","Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":["Health"],"region":["United Kingdom"],"type":"research-report","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This report examines patient organisations’ ever more critical role as knowledge brokers in an increasingly complex, data-rich healthcare system.\nKey findings\n\nPatient organisations are important examples of collective intelligence practiced in challenging conditions with the aim of tackling complex problems.\nWith more long term conditions and multimorbidities, more data, more available options in diagnostics, treatments, and care, knowledge is becoming one of the most critical assets of patients seeking optimal care.\nPatient organisations, working as collectives, are in an excellent position to support the work of translating, assembling and analysing the information involved in healthcare.\nInnovative patient organisations are already supporting the development of peer relationships, driving ambitious research programmes, sharing skills and unlocking the energy and expertise of patients. But they need support from better tools to extend this critical work.\nUnlike many popular examples of collective intelligence such as open source software, people coming to patient organisations are not motivated by pre-existing technical skills, but by urgent personal needs. This makes them a hugely productive site of research.\n\nThe ‘thinking challenges’ patients face are enormous and complex, involving an ever-growing store of medical information, the practical and bureaucratic skills of living with a condition. Many go beyond adherence to understanding and partaking in research.\n\nThe health care system is under strain from increasing demand and resource pressure. The NHS and other healthcare networks have committed to engage and empower patients and support them in developing expertise, enabling them to take a more active role in their own care. But knowledge tools and systems that engage only with individuals tend to exacerbate existing health care divides. Health knowledge work is hard, and requires time and resources.\n\nIn this report we argue that patient organisations have a pivotal role to play in distributing the burden and benefit of knowledge work amongst participants. They need new and better tools to support their work developing connections between the many individuals and institutions of the healthcare system, driving ambitious research programmes, and facilitating peer support.\n\n- See more at: http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/collective-intelligence-patient-organisations#sthash.7pdFEQLH.dpuf"},{"id":"f033ab37c30201f73f142449d037028d","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Conceptualizing Open Data ecosystems: A timeline analysis of Open Data development in the UK","organization":[""],"authors":["Maximilian Heimstädt","Fredric Saunderson","Tom Heath"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://hdl.handle.net/10419/96627","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Access","Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework","Quantitative Analysis","Survey"]},"sector":[""],"region":["United Kingdom"],"type":"working-paper","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"In this paper, we conceptualize Open Data ecosystems by analysing the major stakeholders in the UK.

Following this we consider what if any privacy protection is currently given in UK law to SOCMINT. Given the largely negative response to the above question, we analyse what reasonable expectations of privacy there may be for users of public social media, with reference to existing case law on art 8 of the ECHR. Two factors are in particular argued to be supportive of a reasonable expectation of privacy in open public social media communications: first, the failure of many social network users to perceive the environment where they communicate as “public”; and secondly, the impact of search engines (and other automated analytics) on traditional conceptions of structured dossiers as most problematic for state surveillance.

In this article, we take a quantitative, unbiased, and software-engineering approach to analyze the evolution of the United States Code from 1926 to today. Software engineers frequently face the challenge of understanding and managing large, structured collections of instructions, directives, and conditional statements, and we adapt and apply their techniques to the U.S. Code over time. Our work produces insights into the structure of the U.S. Code as a whole, its strengths and vulnerabilities, and new ways of thinking about individual laws. For example, we identify the first appearance and spread of important terms in the U.S. Code like \"whistleblower\" and \"privacy.\" We also analyze and visualize the network structure of certain substantial reforms, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and show how the interconnections of references can increase complexity and create the potential for unintended consequences.

Widespread use of the internet and web 2.0 technologies have made it easier for organizations to connect with their clients, service providers, and the public at large for more collaborative problem solving and innovation. Introduction of the Open Government initiative accompanied by the America Competes Reauthorization Act signaled an unprecedented commitment by the US Federal Government to stimulating more innovation and creativity in problem solving. The policy and legislation empowered agencies to open up their problem solving space beyond their regular pool of contractors in finding solutions to the nation's most complex problems.\n\nThis is an exploratory study of the adoption of challenges as an organizational innovation in public sector organizations. The main objective is to understand and explain how, and under what conditions challenges are being used by federal agencies and departments as a tool to promote innovation. The organizational innovation literature provides the main theoretical foundation for this study, but does not directly address contextual aspects regarding the type of innovation and the type of organization. The guiding framework uses concepts drawn from three literature streams: organizational innovation, open innovation, and public sector innovation.\n\nResearch was conducted using a qualitative case study of challenge.gov. Data was collected from multiple adopting agencies using two primary sources: interviews with challenge managers and administrators and, archival data from the challenge.gov web platform. Related documentation was used to supplement and corroborate the main data. Analysis of the platform archival data revealed four types of challenges falling along a continuum of increasing innovation. The sequence of events, activities and conditions leading to adoption and implementation were represented as a challenge adoption model. Variations among components of the model resulted in three distinct agency groupings represented as a typology of enactments characterized as inertia, application, and change. Thus challenge adoption among agencies with varying missions, operations and conditions leads to varying enactment types and different levels of change."},{"id":"f899139df5e1059396431415e770c6dd","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"A Process Model for Crowdsourcing Design: A Case Study in Citizen Science","organization":[""],"authors":["Kazjon Grace","Mary Lou Maher","Jennifer Preece","Tom Yeh","Abigale Stangle","Carol Boston"],"paper_date":"2015","url":"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-14956-1_14","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Case Studies","Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":[""],"region":["United States"],"type":"book-chapter","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Crowdsourcing design has been applied in various areas of graphic design, software design, and product design.

Although the Internet creates unprecedented access to information, gaps in the medical literature and inefficient searches often leave healthcare providers' questions unanswered. Advances in social computation and human computer interactions offer a potential solution to this problem. We developed and piloted the mobile application DocCHIRP, which uses a system of point-to-multipoint push notifications designed to help providers problem solve by crowdsourcing from their peers. Over the 244-day pilot period, 85 registered users logged 1544 page views and sent 45 consult questions. The median initial first response from the crowd occurred within 19 minutes. Review of the transcripts revealed several dominant themes, including complex medical decision making and inquiries related to prescription medication use. Feedback from the post-trial survey identified potential hurdles related to medical crowdsourcing, including a reluctance to expose personal knowledge gaps and the potential risk for “distracted doctoring.” Users also suggested program modifications that could support future adoption, including changes to the mobile interface and mechanisms that could expand the crowd of participating healthcare providers.Journal of Hospital Medicine 2014;9:451–456. © 2014 Society of Hospital Medicine"},{"id":"ec8956637a99787bd197eacd77acce5e","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"Digilantism: An Analysis of Crowdsourcing and the Boston Marathon Bombings","organization":[""],"authors":["Johnny Nhan","Laura Huey","Ryan Broll"],"paper_date":"12/6/15","url":"http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/12/06/bjc.azv118.abstract","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Case Studies"]},"sector":["National Security"],"region":["United States"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This paper explores the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing incident and how members of the general public, through the online community Reddit, attempted to provide assistance to law enforcement through conducting their own parallel investigations.

After moving from decentralized to centralized planning efforts, the most recent policy has returned to the philosophy that a decentralized planning approach is the most effective way to plan for a disaster. In fact, under the Obama administration, a policy of using the “whole community” approach to emergency planning has been adopted. This approach, however, creates an obvious problem for state and local government practitioners already under pressure for funding, time, and the continuous need for higher and broader expertise—the problem of how to actually incorporate the whole community into emergency planning efforts. This article suggests one such approach, crowdsourcing, as an option for local governments. The crowdsourcer-problem-crowd-platform-solution (CPCPS) model is suggested as an initial framework for practitioners seeking a practical application and basic comprehension.

Especially the collaboration mandate is relatively unexplored in the literature. In practice, government organizations recognize the need to include external problem solvers into their internal innovation creation processes. This is partly derived from a sense of urgency to improve the efficiency and quality of government service delivery. Another formal driver is the America Competes Act that instructs agencies to search for opportunities to meaningfully promote excellence in technology, education, and science. Government agencies are responding to these requirements by using open innovation (OI) approaches to invite citizens to crowdsource and peer produce solutions to public management problems. These distributed innovation processes occur at all levels of the U.S. government and it is important to understand what design elements are used to create innovative public management ideas. This article systematically reviews existing government crowdsourcing and peer production initiatives and shows that after agencies have defined their public management problem, they go through four different phases of the OI process: (1) idea generation through crowdsourcing, (2) incubation of submitted ideas with peer voting and collaborative improvements of favorite solutions, (3) validation with a proof of concept of implementation possibilities, and (4) reveal of the selected solution and the (internal) implementation of the winning idea. Participation and engagement are incentivized both with monetary and nonmonetary rewards, which lead to tangible solutions as well as intangible innovation outcomes, such as increased public awareness."},{"id":"65b9eea6e1cc6bb9f0cd2a47751a186f","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"A taxonomy of crowdsourcing based on task complexity","organization":[""],"authors":["Robbie T.

Our review found that no taxonomy explored the multidimensional nature of task complexity. This paper develops a taxonomy whose specific intent is the classification of approaches in terms of the types of tasks for which they are best suited. To develop this task-based taxonomy, we followed an iterative approach that considered over 100 well-known examples of crowdsourcing. The taxonomy considers three dimensions of task complexity: (a) task structure – is the task well-defined, or does it require a more open-ended solution; (2) task interdependence – can the task be solved by an individual, or does it require a community of problem solvers; and (3) task commitment – what level of commitment is expected from crowd members? Based on this taxonomy, we identify seven categories of crowdsourcing and discuss prototypical examples of each approach. Furnished with such an understanding, one should be able to determine which crowdsourcing approach is most suitable for a particular task situation."},{"id":"f0935e4cd5920aa6c7c996a5ee53a70f","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"Benchmarking open government: An open data perspective","organization":[""],"authors":["N.

We explored the use of Facebook likes as potential predictors of health outcomes and their behavioral determinants.\n\nMethods: We performed principal components and regression analyses to examine the predictive qualities of Facebook likes with regard to mortality, diseases, and lifestyle behaviors in 214 counties across the United States and 61 of 67 counties in Florida.

Health data were obtained from both the 2010 and 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and mortality data were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System.\nResults: Facebook likes added significant value in predicting most examined health outcomes and behaviors even when controlling for age, race, and socioeconomic status, with model fit improvements (adjusted R2) of an average of 58% across models for 13 different health-related metrics over basic sociodemographic models. Small area data were not available in sufficient abundance to test the accuracy of the model in estimating health conditions in less populated markets, but initial analysis using data from Florida showed a strong model fit for obesity data (adjusted R2=.77).\n\nConclusions: Facebook likes provide estimates for examined health outcomes and health behaviors that are comparable to those obtained from the BRFSS.

In particular, the City of Boston's strategy to put citizen engagement and participation at the center of its efforts, implemented by Chris Osgood and Nigel Jacob as co-chairs of the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, has drawn attention to the potential power of collaboration and technology to transform citizens' connections to their government and to each other. Several global developments have combined to make Boston's collaborative efforts interesting: First, city managers around the world confront shrinking budgets and diminishing trust in the role of government; second, civic entrepreneurs and technology innovators are pressuring local governments to adopt new forms of engagement with citizens; and third, new digital tools are emerging that can help make city services both more visible and more effective. Boston's experience in pursuing partnerships that facilitate opportunities for engaging citizens may provide scalable (and disruptive) lessons for other cities.\n\nDuring the summer of 2013, in anticipation of Mayor Menino's retirement in January 2014, Prof. Susan Crawford and Project Assistant Dana Walters carried out a case study examining the ongoing evolution of the Boston Mayor's Hotline into a platform for civic engagement. We chose this CRM focus because the initial development of the system provides a concrete example of how leaders in government can connect to local partners and citizens. In the course of this research, we interviewed 21 city employees and several of their partners outside government, and gathered data about the use of the system. (Exhibit A is a list of interviewees.)\n\nWe found a traditional technology story — selection and integration of CRM software, initial performance management using that software, development of ancillary channels of communication, initial patterns of adoption and use — that reflects the commitment of Mayor Menino to personalized constituent service. We also found that that commitment, his long tenure, and the particular personalities of the people on the New Urban Mechanics team make this both a cultural story as well as a technology story. Here are the highlights: The combination of Mitchell Weiss's vision for citizen engagement, Nigel Jacob's expertise in software development and digital strategy, Chris Osgood's experience in navigating government bureaucracy, and Bill Oates's (CIO) private-sector experience has allowed this team to launch successful projects and build valuable partnerships that focus on citizen-centered innovation; Even without budgetary authority or staff, the innovation office within the Mayor's suite (the Office of New Urban Mechanics) has been able to nudge, encourage, and facilitate collaborations inside City Hall and across academic institutions, technologists, and other city governments that have been productive; As one example of the team's joint efforts and partnerships, both inside and outside City Hall, the launch of Boston's Lagan CRM system in October 2008 was followed by integration of the system into the operations of several constituent-facing service departments; The system has evolved over time to include, among other things, a mobile app for field workers in the Department of Public Works (City Worker), a smartphone app for citizens (Citizen Connect), reports that are useful for performance management, and several different channels through which citizens can interact with City Hall, while retaining its high-touch, personalized character; Although every CRM system case is assigned a case ID number, the CRM system as a whole does not automatically assign a unique identifier to citizens that would allow uniform tracking across different modes of contact (smartphone app, Web interface, phone call) or mapping of particular citizens to particular neighborhoods. Constituents who contact the system may voluntarily provide contact details (name, home address, email, and phone); Future versions of this system, and layering of CRM data over other City data (911, inspections, sensor data, social sentiment data, traffic data), could make possible much more extensive citizen collaboration, situation awareness, policy inputs, performance analysis, and co-creation of government services or policies. Although there are many channels for reporting into the CRM system — Citizens Connect, SMS, web chat, phone calls — all of the people reporting in are not connected to each other, and the lack of unique identifiers makes true \"citizen relationship management\" difficult. Customer satisfaction is also not measured by the system, as far as we can tell. Outbound calls, texting, and Twitter/social media sentiment mining might be useful tools for this assessment; Combining formal CRM requests with social sentiment information could provide useful guidance underpinning policy decisions and resource allocation. Connecting all of this information to job functions within City Hall would also clearly be productive. And if we believe that people in their communities know more about their communities than all the gifted people in City Hall, how do we enable them to help themselves solve some of their own problems? Boston City Hall has not been focused on predictive analytics or the public release of data; rather, the team's top priorities (in line with Mayor Menino's strategy) have been to improve service delivery and encourage citizen engagement; Mayor Menino's leadership style, strategic goals, and long tenure, together with the particular personalities of the members of the core team profiled in this study, have been essential to this narrative; The longterm effects on either the operation of City government or citizen engagement of the Office of New Urban Mechanics and the innovative, experimental ethos encouraged by that Office, Chief of Staff Mitchell Weiss, and CIO Bill Oates are unclear. Much will depend on the character and priorities of the new mayor.\n\n"},{"id":"2b44928ae11fb9384c4cf38708677c48","related_content":[{"url":"http://www.science20.com/news_articles/science_20_codifying_collegiality_and_an_increase_in_datasharing-145779","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Codifying Collegiality: Recent Developments in Data Sharing Policy in the Life Sciences","organization":[""],"authors":["G.

We also examine the effects of new sharing infrastructure and tools (i.e., third party repositories and online supplements). We find that recently enacted data sharing policies and new sharing infrastructure and tools have had a sizable effect on encouraging data sharing. In particular, third party repositories and online supplements as well as data sharing requirements of funding agencies, particularly the NIH and the National Human Genome Research Institute, were perceived by scientists to have had a large effect on facilitating data sharing. In addition, we found a high degree of compliance with these new policies, although noncompliance resulted in few formal or informal sanctions. Despite the overall effectiveness of data sharing policies, some significant gaps remain: about one third of grant reviewers placed no weight on data sharing plans in their reviews, and a similar percentage ignored the requirements of material transfer agreements.

When coupled with a participatory Web culture and infrastructure, teachers can share their creations as well as leverage from the best that their peers have to offer to support a collective intelligence or crowdsourcing community, which we dubcrowdteaching. We applied a collective intelligence framework to characterize crowdteaching in the context of a Web-based tool for teachers called the Instructional Architect (IA). The IA enables teachers to find, create, and share instructional activities (called IA projects) for their students using online learning resources. These IA projects can further be viewed, copied, or adapted by other IA users. This study examines the usage activities of two samples of teachers, and also analyzes the characteristics of a subset of their IA projects. Analyses of teacher activities suggest that they are engaging in crowdteaching processes. Teachers, on average, chose to share over half of their IA projects, and copied some directly from other IA projects. Thus, these teachers can be seen as both contributors to and consumers of crowdteaching processes. In addition, IA users preferred to view IA projects rather than to completely copy them.

One problem with manipulation, thus understood, is that it fails to respect people’s autonomy and is an affront to their dignity. Another problem is that if they are products of manipulation, people’s choices might fail to promote their own welfare, and might instead promote the welfare of the manipulator. To that extent, the central objection to manipulation is rooted in a version of Mill’s Harm Principle: People know what is in their best interests and should have a (manipulation-free) opportunity to make that decision. On welfarist grounds, the norm against manipulation can be seen as a kind of heuristic, one that generally works well, but that can also lead to serious errors, at least when the manipulator is both informed and genuinely interested in the welfare of the chooser. \n\nFor the legal system, a pervasive puzzle is why manipulation is rarely policed. The simplest answer is that manipulation has so many shades, and in a social order that values free markets and is committed to freedom of expression, it is exceptionally difficult to regulate manipulation as such. But as the manipulator’s motives become more self-interested or venal, and as efforts to bypass people’s deliberative capacities becomes more successful, the ethical objections to manipulation become very forceful, and the argument for a legal response is fortified. The analysis of manipulation bears on emerging first amendment issues raised by compelled speech, especially in the context of graphic health warnings. Importantly, it can also help orient the regulation of financial products, where manipulation of consumer choices is an evident but rarely explicit concern."},{"id":"4c56ff4ce4aaf9573aa5dff913df997a","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Is Transparency a Recipe for Innovation?","organization":[""],"authors":["Bastiaan Heemsbergen"],"paper_date":"2015","url":"http://irc.queensu.ca/articles/transparency-recipe-innovation","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Open Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Legitimacy"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":[""],"region":["United States"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Innovation is a key driver in organizational sustainability, and yes, openness and transparency are a recipe for innovation. But, according to Tapscott and Williams, “when it comes to innovation, competitive advantage and organizational success, ‘openness’ is rarely the first word one would use to describe companies and other societal organizations like government agencies or medical institutions. For many, words like ‘insular,’ ‘bureaucratic,’ ‘hierarchical,’ ‘secretive’ and ‘closed’ come to mind instead.”1 And yet a few months ago, The Tesla Model S just became the world's first open-source car. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motor Vehicles, shared all the patents on Tesla's electric car technology, allowing anyone — including competitors — to use them without fear of litigation. Elon wrote in his post “Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology.”2\nIn the public sector, terms such as open government, citizen sourcing, and wiki government are also akin to the notion of open innovation and transparency. As Hilgers and Ihl report, “a good example of this approach is the success of the Future Melbourne program, a Wiki and blog-based approach to shaping the future urban landscape of Australia’s second largest city. The program allowed citizens to directly edit and comment on the plans for the future development of the city. It attracted more than 30,000 individuals, who submitted hundreds of comments and suggestions (futuremelbourne.com.au). Basically, problems concerning design and creativity, future strategy and local culture, and even questions of management and service innovation can be broadcasted on such web-platforms.”3 The authors suggest that there are three dimensions to applying the concept of open innovation to the public sector: citizen ideation and innovation (tapping knowledge and creativity), collaborative administration (user generated new tasks and processes), and collaborative democracy (improve public participation in the policy process)."},{"id":"a0a080f42e6f13b3a2df133f073095dd","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Managing Innovation in a Crowd","organization":[""],"authors":["Daron Acemoglu","Mohamed Mostagir","Asuman E.

At the center of crowdsourcing is a resource allocation problem: there is an abundance of workers but a scarcity of high skills, and an easy task assigned to a high-skill worker is a waste of resources. This problem is complicated by the fact that the exact difficulties of innovation tasks may not be known in advance, so tasks that require high-skill labor cannot be identified and allocated ahead of time. We show that the solution to this problem takes the form of a skill hierarchy, where tasks are first attempted by low-skill labor, and high skill workers only engage with a task if less skilled workers are unable to finish it. This hierarchy can be constructed and implemented in a decentralized manner even though neither the difficulties of the tasks nor the skills of the candidate workers are known. We provide a dynamic pricing mechanism that achieves this implementation by inducing workers to self-select into different layers. The mechanism is simple: each time a task is attempted and not finished, its price (reward upon completion) goes up."},{"id":"202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Nowcasting Disaster Damage","organization":[""],"authors":["Yury Kryvasheyeu","Haohui Chena","Nick Obradovich","Esteban Moroe","Pascal Van Hentenryck","James Fowler","Manuel Cebrian"],"paper_date":"2015","url":"http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1504/1504.06827.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Quantitative Analysis","Statistical Modeling"]},"sector":["Public Safety"],"region":["United States"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Could social media data aid in disaster response and damage assessment?

With the popularity of social media growing, the Internet is a source for syndromic surveillance due to the availability of large amounts of data. In this study, tweets, or posts of 140 characters or less, from the website Twitter were collected and analyzed for their potential as surveillance for seasonal influenza.\nObjective: There were three aims: (1) to improve the correlation of tweets to sentinel-provided influenza-like illness (ILI) rates by city through filtering and a machine-learning classifier, (2) to observe correlations of tweets for emergency department ILI rates by city, and (3) to explore correlations for tweets to laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego.\nMethods: Tweets containing the keyword “flu” were collected within a 17-mile radius from 11 US cities selected for population and availability of ILI data. At the end of the collection period, 159,802 tweets were used for correlation analyses with sentinel-provided ILI and emergency department ILI rates as reported by the corresponding city or county health department. Two separate methods were used to observe correlations between tweets and ILI rates: filtering the tweets by type (non-retweets, retweets, tweets with a URL, tweets without a URL), and the use of a machine-learning classifier that determined whether a tweet was “valid”, or from a user who was likely ill with the flu.\nResults: Correlations varied by city but general trends were observed. Non-retweets and tweets without a URL had higher and more significant (P<.05) correlations than retweets and tweets with a URL. Correlations of tweets to emergency department ILI rates were higher than the correlations observed for sentinel-provided ILI for most of the cities. The machine-learning classifier yielded the highest correlations for many of the cities when using the sentinel-provided or emergency department ILI as well as the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego. High correlation values (r=.93) with significance at P<.001 were observed for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for most categories and tweets determined to be valid by the classifier.\nConclusions: Compared to tweet analyses in the previous influenza season, this study demonstrated increased accuracy in using Twitter as a supplementary surveillance tool for influenza as better filtering and classification methods yielded higher correlations for the 2013-2014 influenza season than those found for tweets in the previous influenza season, where emergency department ILI rates were better correlated to tweets than sentinel-provided ILI rates. Further investigations in the field would require expansion with regard to the location that the tweets are collected from, as well as the availability of more ILI data.\n\n"},{"id":"ec5decca5ed3d6b8079e2e7e7bacc9f2","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"A new model to explore non-profit social media use for advocacy and civic engagement","organization":[""],"authors":["David Chapman","Katrina Miller-Stevens","John C.

In particular, the business opportunities have received much attention. But for all the excitement, we still know very little about how and under what conditions open data really works.\n\nTo broaden our understanding of the use and impact of open data, the GovLab has a variety of initiatives and studies underway. Today, we share publicly our findings on how Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are leveraging open data for a variety of purposes. Our paper “Open Data: A 21st Century Asset for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises” seeks to build a portrait of the lifecycle of open data—how it is collected, stored and used. It outlines some of the most important parameters of an open data business model for SMEs.\n\nThe universe of SMEs we analyzed comprised those identified within the GovLab’s Open Data 500 project which contains data on how 500 US businesses are using open data in their day-to-day activities. It represents arguably the first systematic effort to really understand how open data can grow revenues, drive innovation, increase efficiency and create new jobs.\n\nThe paper analyzes ten aspects of open data and establishes ten principles for its effective use by SMEs. Taken together, these offer a roadmap for any SME considering greater use or adoption of open data in its business.\n\nAmong the key findings included in the paper:\n\nSMEs, which often lack access to data or sophisticated analytical tools to process large datasets, are likely to be one of the chief beneficiaries of open data.\nGovernment data is the main category of open data being used by SMEs. A number of SMEs are also using open scientific and shared corporate data.\nOpen data is used primarily to serve the Business-to-Business (B2B) markets, followed by the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) markets.

But the process of protecting data subjects in shared information remains integral to privacy practice and policy. While the deidentification debate has been vigorous and productive, there is no clear direction for policy. As a result, the law has been slow to adapt a holistic approach to protecting data subjects when data sets are released to others. Currently, the law is focused on whether an individual can be identified within a given set. We argue that the better locus of data release policy is on the process of minimizing the risk of reidentification and sensitive attribute disclosure. Process-based data release policy, which resembles the law of data security, will help us move past the limitations of focusing on whether data sets have been “anonymized.” It draws upon different tactics to protect the privacy of data subjects, including accurate deidentification rhetoric, contracts prohibiting reidentification and sensitive attribute disclosure, data enclaves, and query-based strategies to match required protections with the level of risk. By focusing on process, data release policy can better balance privacy and utility where nearly all data exchanges carry some risk."},{"id":"7f1de29e6da19d22b51c68001e7e0e54","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"Open Government: Missing Questions","organization":[""],"authors":["Vadym Pyrozhenko"],"paper_date":"11/19/2015","url":"http://aas.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/19/0095399715581624.abstract","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Open Data"],"objective":["Legitimacy"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":[""],"region":["United States"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This article places the Obama administration’s open government initiative within the context of evolution of the U.S. information society.

Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, threats to public safety can be a key factor in that decision. Implicitly, a forecast of “future dangerousness” is required. In this article, we consider in particular whether usefully accurate forecasts of domestic violence can be obtained. We apply machine learning to data on over 28,000 arraignment cases from a major metropolitan area in which an offender faces domestic violence charges. One of three possible post-arraignment outcomes is forecasted within two years: (1) a domestic violence arrest associated with a physical injury, (2) a domestic violence arrest not associated with a physical injury, and (3) no arrests for domestic violence. We incorporate asymmetric costs for different kinds of forecasting errors so that very strong statistical evidence is required before an offender is forecasted to be a good risk. When an out-of-sample forecast of no post-arraignment domestic violence arrests within two years is made, it is correct about 90 percent of the time. Under current practice within the jurisdiction studied, approximately 20 percent of those released after an arraignment for domestic violence are arrested within two years for a new domestic violence offense. If magistrates used the methods we have developed and released only offenders forecasted not to be arrested for domestic violence within two years after an arraignment, as few as 10 percent might be arrested. The failure rate could be cut nearly in half. Over a typical 24-month period in the jurisdiction studied, well over 2,000 post-arraignment arrests for domestic violence perhaps could be averted."},{"id":"1385974ed5904a438616ff7bdb3f7439","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"New Tools for Collaboration: The Experience of the U.S. Intelligence Community","organization":[""],"authors":["Gregory F.

The focus is analysis and the analytic process, but collaborative tools can and do serve many other functions in the Intelligence Community—from improving logistics or human resources, to better connecting collection and analysis, to assisting administration and development, to facilitating, as one interlocutor put it, operational “go” decisions. Yet it is in the analytic realm that collaboration is both most visible and most rubs against traditional work processes that are not widely collaborative.\n\nThe report defines terms and discusses concepts, first exploring collaboration and coordination, then defining collaborative tools and social media, then surveying the experience of the private sector. The second section of the report uses those distinctions to sort out the blizzard of collaborative tools that have been created in the various intelligence agencies and across them. The third section outlines the state of collaboration, again both within agencies and across them. The report concludes with findings and recommendations for the Community.

This conception of privacy misses an important component of the policy problem. An individual who is careless with data exposes not only extensive information about herself, but about others as well. The negative externalities imposed on nonconsenting outsiders by such carelessness can be productively studied in terms of welfare economics. If all relevant individuals maximize private benefit, and expect all other relevant individuals to do the same, neoclassical economic theory predicts that society will achieve a suboptimal level of privacy. This prediction holds even if all individuals cherish privacy with the same intensity. As the theoretical literature would have it, the struggle for privacy is destined to become a tragedy.\n\nBut according to the experimental public-goods literature, there is hope. Like in real life, people in experiments cooperate in groups at rates well above those predicted by neoclassical theory. Groups can be aided in their struggle to produce public goods by institutions, such as communication, framing, or sanction. With these institutions, communities can manage public goods without heavy-handed government intervention. Legal scholarship has not fully engaged this problem in these terms. In this Article, we explain why privacy has aspects of a public good, and we draw lessons from both the theoretical and the empirical literature on public goods to inform the policy discourse on privacy."},{"id":"a8baa56554f96369ab93e4f3bb068c22","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Report to the President: Technology and the Future of Cities","organization":[""],"authors":["President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology"],"paper_date":"2/2016","url":"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_cities_report___final_3_2016.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis","Smart Cities"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":[""],"region":["United States"],"type":"research-report","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Cities are beginning a new era of change.

This could encourage innovation in sectors where patents and traditional research spending have lagged, while also bringing those innovations to market more quickly and affordably.

While these previous studies have been invaluable for revealing important biological factors in cardiac health or social factors in retirement choices, no single repository contains anything like a complete record of the health, education, genetics, environmental, and lifestyle profiles of a large group of individuals at the within-subject level. This seems critical today because emerging evidence about the dynamic interplay between biology, behavior, and the environment point to a pressing need for just the kind of large-scale, long-term synoptic dataset that does not yet exist at the within-subject level. At the same time that the need for such a dataset is becoming clear, there is also growing evidence that just such a synoptic dataset may now be obtainable—at least at moderate scale—using contemporary big data approaches. To this end, we introduce the Kavli HUMAN Project (KHP), an effort to aggregate data from 2,500 New York City households in all five boroughs (roughly 10,000 individuals) whose biology and behavior will be measured using an unprecedented array of modalities over 20 years. It will also richly measure environmental conditions and events that KHP members experience using a geographic information system database of unparalleled scale, currently under construction in New York. In this manner, KHP will offer both synoptic and granular views of how human health and behavior coevolve over the life cycle and why they evolve differently for different people. In turn, we argue that this will allow for new discovery-based scientific approaches, rooted in big data analytics, to improving the health and quality of human life, particularly in urban contexts."},{"id":"2b24d495052a8ce66358eb576b8912c8","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"The Diffusion and Evolution of 311 Citizen Service Centers in American Cities from 1996 to 2012: A Study to Identify the Catalysts for the Adoption of Citizen Engagement Technology","organization":[""],"authors":["John Christopher O'Byrne"],"paper_date":"4/21/2015","url":"http://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/52634/O_Byrne_JC_D_2015.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Case Studies","Quantitative Analysis"]},"sector":[""],"region":["United States"],"type":"thesisdissertation","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This study of the diffusion and evolution of the 311 innovation in the form of citizen service centers and as a technology cluster has been designed to help identify the catalysts for the spread of government-to-citizen (G2C) technology in local government in order to better position future G2C technology for a more rapid rate of adoption.

Despite the recent surge of behavioral analysis in European academia, a scrutiny of decisions by courts and regulatory agencies in the US and the EU reveals striking differences. While in the US rulings by courts and regulatory agencies progressively take insights from behavioral economics into account, EU courts and agencies still, and even increasingly, cling to the rational actor model. These inverse trends can be uncovered in the interpretation of legal concepts of human agency, ie, of those elements in a legal order which refer, implicitly or explicitly, to a model of rationality of human actors. More particularly, this paper reviews the concepts of consumers and of users, in consumer law and product liability respectively, to underscore the claim of the behavioral divide. Importantly, the divergence between EU and US private law practice calls for a normative evaluation. In the face of empirical uncertainty about the existence, direction and intensity of biases, the most attractive legal concept of human agency is a pluralistic one, assuming the simultaneous presence of boundedly and fully rational actors. In concrete applications, this paper shows that a pluralistic perspective urges a revision of the concept of the reasonable consumer, both in US and EU consumer law. Furthermore, such a view leads to the adoption of a more boundedly rational user concept in product liability.

Wired captures certain interests and desires with the QS metaphor, while ignoring and downplaying others, suggesting that the QS positions self-tracking devices and applications as interfaces that energize technological engagements, thereby pushing us to rethink life in a data-driven manner. The thematic analysis of the QS is treated as a schematic aid for raising critical questions about self-quantification, for instance, detecting the merging of epistemological claims, technological devices, and market-making efforts.

Open data and open government initiatives promise to “open up” government operations to citizens. New forms of “big data” analysis can be used by government itself to understand citizens' behavior and reveal the strengths and weaknesses of policy and service delivery. In practice, however, open data emerges as a reform development directed to a range of goals, including the stimulation of economic development, and not strictly transparency or public service improvement. Meanwhile, governments have been slow to capitalize on the potential of big data, while the largest data they do collect remain “closed” and under-exploited within the confines of intelligence agencies.

The hopeful assumption they share is that labs, by building on openness among other features, can generate promising solutions to grand challenges of the future. Despite their seeming proliferation and popularisation, the underlying innovation paradigm embodied by labs has so far received scant academic attention. This is a missed opportunity, because innovation labs are potentially fruitful vehicles for leveraging openness for radical innovation. Indeed, they not only strive to span organisational, sectoral and geographical boundaries by bringing a variety of uncommon actors together to embrace radical ideas and out-of-the box thinking, but they also aim to apply the concept of openness throughout the innovation process, including the experimentation and development phases. While the phenomenon of labs clearly forms part of a broader trend towards openness, it seems to transcend traditional conceptualisations of open innovation (Chesbrough, 2006), open strategy (Whittington et al., 2011), open science (David, 1998) or open government (Janssen et al., 2012). What are innovation labs about, how do they differ from other innovation efforts and how do they embrace openness to create breakthrough innovations?

We have found that despite seemingly good intentions and an extensive rhetoric, there is still an apparent lack of adequate tools in which public deliberation and representation are addressed in any meaningful sense. There are two main important observations herein: (i) the rhetoric in the dominant discourse supports the concept of open government formulated by the Obama administration as transparency, participation, and collaboration, but in practice, the focus is predominantly on transparency and information exchange, while ignoring fundamental democratic issues regarding participation and collaboration, and (ii) the concept of the public is inadequately considered as a homogenous entity rather than a diversified group with different interests, preferences, and abilities."},{"id":"8f53295a73878494e9bc8dd6c3c7104f","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"Open Source Governance—A More Ambitious Cousin of Collaborative Governance","organization":[""],"authors":["Ani Mateia","Sergiu Ioan Irimia"],"paper_date":"9/25/2015","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01900692.2014.907315","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Expert Networking"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":[""],"region":[""],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Open source represents a model generally known for its success in software production.

Chain reactions caused by these tiny acts of participation form a growing part of collective action today, from neighborhood campaigns to global political movements. Political Turbulence reveals that, in fact, most attempts at collective action online do not succeed, but some give rise to huge mobilizations—even revolutions.\n\nDrawing on large-scale data generated from the Internet and real-world events, this book shows how mobilizations that succeed are unpredictable, unstable, and often unsustainable. To better understand this unruly new force in the political world, the authors use experiments that test how social media influence citizens deciding whether or not to participate. They show how different personality types react to social influences and identify which types of people are willing to participate at an early stage in a mobilization when there are few supporters or signals of viability. The authors argue that pluralism is the model of democracy that is emerging in the social media age—not the ordered, organized vision of early pluralists, but a chaotic, turbulent form of politics.\n\nThis book demonstrates how data science and experimentation with social data can provide a methodological toolkit for understanding, shaping, and perhaps even predicting the outcomes of this democratic turbulence."},{"id":"fc221309746013ac554571fbd180e1c8","related_content":[{"url":"http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/book/audiobook.php","title":"Videos"}],"access":"Closed","title":"Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict Who Will Click, Buy, Lie, or Die","organization":[""],"authors":["Eric Siegel"],"paper_date":"1/2016","url":"http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/book/overview.php","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis","Big Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Case Studies"]},"sector":[""],"region":[""],"type":"book","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"An introduction for everyone.

A smarter city infuses information into its physical infrastructure to improve conveniences, facilitate mobility, add efficiencies, conserve energy, improve the quality of air and water, identify problems and fix them quickly, recover rapidly from disasters, collect data to make better decisions, deploy resources effectively and share data to enable collaboration across entities and domains.

They bring with them a variety of meanings for OGD. The purpose of this paper is to show how the different stakeholders and their different perspectives on OGD can be analyzed in a given context. Taking Chile as an OGD exemplar, stakeholder analysis is used to identify and categorize stakeholder groups in terms of their relative power and interest as either primary (in this case, politicians, public officials, public sector practitioners, international organizations) or secondary (civil society activists, funding donors, ICT providers, academics). Stakeholder groups sometimes associated with OGD but absent from significant involvement in Chile – such as private sector- and citizen-users – are also identified.\n\nFour different perspectives on open government data – bureaucratic, political, technological, and economic – are identified from a literature review. Template analysis is used to analyze text – OGD-related reports, conference presentations, and interviews in Chile – in terms of those perspectives. This shows bureaucratic and political perspectives to be more dominant than the other two, and also some presence for a politico-economic perspective not identified from the original literature review. The information value chain is used to identify a “missing middle” in current Chilean OGD perspectives: a lack of connection between a reality of data provision and an aspiration of developmental results. This pattern of perspectives can be explained by the capacities and interests of key stakeholders, with those in turn being shaped by Chile's history, politics, and institutions.\n\nOverall, stakeholder analysis and perspectives analysis are shown from this case to be workable techniques for OGD that add value by exposing the identity, power, motivations, and worldview of key actors. They provide a necessary foundation of knowledge for both researchers and practitioners who need to understand the different meanings of OGD in any particular context."},{"id":"58a2fc6ed39fd083f55d4182bf88826d","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"The power of crowds","organization":[""],"authors":["Pietro Michelucci","Janis L.

A decision-making model is presented capturing trade-offs, and in this way providing guidance for weighing the creation of public value and the risks.

This book investigates the changing fortunes of the citizen-civil society relationship by exploring how social changes and innovations in communication technology are transforming the information expectations and preferences of many citizens, especially young citizens. In doing so, it is the first work to bring together theories of civic identity change with research on civic organizations. Specifically, it argues that a shift in \"information styles\" may help to explain the disjuncture felt by many young people when it comes to institutional participation and politics. The book theorizes two paradigms of information style: a dutiful style, which was rooted in the society, communication system and citizen norms of the modern era, and an actualizing style, which constitutes the set of information practices and expectations of the young citizens of late modernity for whom interactive digital media are the norm. Hypothesizing that civil society institutions have difficulty adapting to the norms and practices of the actualizing information style, two empirical studies apply the dutiful/actualizing framework to innovative content analyses of organizations' online communications-on their websites, and through Facebook. Results demonstrate that with intriguing exceptions, most major civil society organizations use digital media more in line with dutiful information norms than actualizing ones: they tend to broadcast strategic messages to an audience of receivers, rather than encouraging participation or exchange among an active set of participants. The book concludes with a discussion of the tensions inherent in bureaucratic organizations trying to adapt to an actualizing information style, and recommendations for how they may more successfully do so."},{"id":"3b8a614226a953a8cd9526fca6fe9ba5","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"Secrecy and Publicity in Votes and Debates","organization":[""],"authors":["Jon Elster"],"paper_date":"7/2015","url":"http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/political-theory/secrecy-and-publicity-votes-and-debates?format=HB","taxonomy":{"category":["Collective Intelligence"],"objective":["Legitimacy"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework","Qualitative Analysis"]},"sector":["Politics"],"region":[""],"type":"book","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"In the spirit of Jeremy Bentham's Political Tactics, this volume offers the first comprehensive discussion of the effects of secrecy and publicity on debates and votes in committees and assemblies.

Without managing this crisis effectively, bed bug infestation can cause economic loss and reputational damages to hotel properties, ranging from negative comments and complaints, to possible lawsuits.

We found that, compared to single radiologists, any of these CI-rules both increases true positives (i.e., recalls of patients with cancer) and decreases false positives (i.e., recalls of patients without cancer), thereby overcoming one of the fundamental limitations to decision accuracy that individual radiologists face.

A flurry of initiative and concomitant media hype in this area has led to exuberant hopes that the end of impunity is not such a distant possibility any more - at least not for the most blatant, ubiquitous and visible forms of administrative corruption, such as bribes and extortion payments that on average almost a quarter of citizens reported to face year in, year out in their daily lives in so many countries around the world (Transparency International 2013). \n\nOnly with hindsight will we be able to tell, if these hopes were justified. However, a closer look at an interdisciplinary body of literature on corruption and social mobilisation can help shed some interesting light on these questions and offer a fresh perspective on the potential of social media based crowd-sourcing for better governance and less corruption. So far the potential of crowd-sourcing is mainly approached from a technology-centred perspective. Where challenges are identified, pondered, and worked upon they are primarily technical and managerial in nature, ranging from issues of privacy protection and fighting off hacker attacks to challenges of data management, information validation or fundraising. \n\nIn contrast, short shrift is being paid to insights from a substantive, multi-disciplinary and growing body of literature on how corruption works, how it can be fought and more generally how observed logics of collective action and social mobilisation interact with technological affordances and condition the success of these efforts. \n\nThis imbalanced debate is not really surprising as it seems to follow the trajectory of the hype-and-bust cycle that we have seen in the public debate for a variety of other technology applications. From electronic health cards to smart government, to intelligent transport systems, all these and many other highly ambitious initiatives start with technology-centric visions of transformational impact. However, over time - with some hard lessons learnt and large sums spent - they all arrive at a more pragmatic and nuanced view on how social and economic forces shape the implementation of such technologies and require a more shrewd design approach, in order to make it more likely that potential actually translates into impact.\n\nAt a minimum, a trawl through this literature makes it possible to move beyond some of the most common-sense conjectures and develop a few more granular guesses on the future of crowd-sourcing corruption. At best, this approach may help identify some not so obvious challenges that may arise along the way and ensure that they are considered in the design process of future corruption crowd-sourcing interventions, raising their likelihood of impact and sustainable success.\n\nThe remainder of this essay is structured as follows: Section 1 introduces the concept of crowd-sourcing for good governance. It provides a very brief overview of some related initiatives in this area, alongside some of the challenges and reservations that are commonly raised in the debate. Section 2 casts the net a bit wider. It looks for interesting insight and cues in the broader social science literature on social mobilisation and corruption. Based on this, it seeks to gain a better understanding of what other more fundamental challenges may lay ahead for crowd-reporting corruption. Section 3 picks up on these anticipated challenges and presents some ideas on how to address them, both in the design, as well as in the implementation of future crowd-reporting systems, drawing both on emerging insights from impact assessments of conventional social accountability mechanisms as well as lessons learnt within Transparency International’s own global network of anti-corruption NGOs, some of which already run crowd-reporting platforms.\n\n"},{"id":"01161aaa0b6d1345dd8fe4e481144d84","related_content":[{"url":"http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=4189#.VqkRxsdiwmc","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Crowdsourced earthquake early warning","organization":[""],"authors":["Sarah E.

A new online program, CrowdMed, aims to leverage the “wisdom of the crowd” by giving patients an opportunity to submit their cases and interact with case solvers to obtain diagnostic possibilities.\n\nObjective: To describe CrowdMed and provide an independent assessment of its impact.\n\nMethods: Patients submit their cases online to CrowdMed and case solvers sign up to help diagnose patients. Case solvers attempt to solve patients’ diagnostic dilemmas and often have an interactive online discussion with patients, including an exchange of additional diagnostic details. At the end, patients receive detailed reports containing diagnostic suggestions to discuss with their physicians and fill out surveys about their outcomes. We independently analyzed data collected from cases between May 2013 and April 2015 to determine patient and case solver characteristics and case outcomes.\n\nResults: During the study period, 397 cases were completed. These patients previously visited a median of 5 physicians, incurred a median of US $10,000 in medical expenses, spent a median of 50 hours researching their illnesses online, and had symptoms for a median of 2.6 years. During this period, 357 active case solvers participated, of which 37.9% (132/348) were male and 58.3% (208/357) worked or studied in the medical industry.

Consequently, we argue that the effects on industries and organizations by open crowds are still to be explored, possibly via the mechanisms of entrepreneurs exploiting open crowds as new entrants, but also for the configuration of industries such as, e.g., finance, pharmaceuticals, or even the public sector where the value created usually comes from interpretation issues and exploratory problem solving.\n\n"},{"id":"0266e33d3f546cb5436a10798e657d97","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Ebola: A Big Data Disaster: Privacy, Property, and the Law of Disaster Experimentation","organization":[""],"authors":["Sean Martin McDonald"],"paper_date":"3/2016","url":"http://cis-india.org/papers/ebola-a-big-data-disaster","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis","Big Data","Open Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Legitimacy","Privacy"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework","Case Studies"]},"sector":["Health","Crisis Response"],"region":[""],"type":"white-paper","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Digitizing disaster response invites the problems of digital systems into the most fragile and vulnerable environments in the world.

We introduce a new crowdsourcing framework for acquiring and analyzing the mobile videos utilizing fine granularity spatial metadata of videos for a rapidly changing disaster situation. We also develop an analytical model to quantify the visual awareness of a video based on its metadata and propose the visual awareness maximization problem for acquiring the most relevant data under bandwidth constraints.

The theory of libertarian paternalism originally advanced by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, and given further defense by Sunstein alone, is itself just a sexy ad campaign designed to nudge gullible readers into thinking that there is no conflict between libertarianism and welfare utilitarianism. But no one should lose sight of the fact that welfare utilitarianism just is welfare utilitarianism only if it sacrifices individual liberty whenever it is at odds with maximizing societal welfare. And thus no one who believes that people have rights to craft their own lives through the exercise of their own choices ought to be duped into thinking that just because paternalistic nudges are cleverly manipulative and often invisible, rather than overtly coercive, standard welfare utilitarianism can lay claim to being libertarian. \n\nAfter outlining four distinct strains of libertarian theory and sketching their mutual incompatibility with so-called “libertarian paternalism,” I go on to demonstrate at some length how the two most prevalent strains — namely, opportunity set libertarianism and motivational libertarianism — make paternalistically-motivated nudges abuses of state power. As I argue, opportunity set libertarians should recognize nudges for what they are — namely, state incursions into the sphere of liberty in which individual choice is a matter of moral right, the boundaries of which are rightly defined, in part, by permissions to do actions that do not maximize welfare. And motivational libertarians should similarly recognize nudges for what they are — namely, illicitly motivated forms of legislative intervention that insult autonomy no less than do flat bans that leave citizens with no choice but to substitute the state’s agenda for their own. As I conclude, whatever its name, a political theory that recommends to state officials the use of “nudges” as means of ensuring that citizens’ advance the state’s understanding of their own best interests is no more compatible with libertarianism than is a theory that recommends more coercive means of paternalism."},{"id":"19f3cd308f1455b3fa09a282e0d496f4","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Gamification and Sustainable Consumption: Overcoming the Limitations of Persuasive Technologies","organization":[""],"authors":["Martina Z.

The goods and services we consume cause resource extractions, greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts that are already affecting the conditions of living on Earth. To support the transition toward sustainable consumption patterns, ICT applications that persuade consumers to change their behavior into a “green” direction have been developed in the field of Persuasive Technology (PT). Such persuasive systems, however, have been criticized for two reasons. First, they are often based on the assumption that information (e.g., information on individual energy consumption) causes behavior change, or a change in awareness and attitude that then changes behavior. Second, PT approaches assume that the designer of the system starts from objective criteria for “sustainable” behavior and is able to operationalize them in the context of the application.\r\n\nIn this chapter, we are exploring the potential of gamification to overcome the limitations of persuasive systems. Gamification, the process of using game elements in a non-game context, opens up a broader design space for ICT applications created to support sustainable consumption. In particular, a gamification-based approach may give the user more autonomy in selecting goals and relating individual action to social interaction. The idea of gamification may also help designers to view the user’s actions in a broader context and to recognize the relevance of different motivational aspects of social interaction, such as competition and cooperation. Based on this discussion we define basic requirements to be used as guidance in gamification- based motivation design for sustainable consumption."},{"id":"03c6b06952c750899bb03d998e631860","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Google Votes:  Liquid Democracy Experiment on a Corporate Social Network","organization":[""],"authors":["Steve Hardt","Lia C.

Countries that develop a data governance framework that enables privacy-protective data use will not only have the information needed to promote quality, efficiency and performance in their health systems, they will become a more attractive centre for medical research. After examining the current situation in OECD countries, a multi-disciplinary advisory panel of experts identified eight key data governance mechanisms to maximise benefits to patients and to societies from the collection, linkage and analysis of health data and to, at the same time, minimise risks to the privacy of patients and to the security of health data. These mechanisms include coordinated development of high-value, privacy-protective health information systems, legislation that permits privacy-protective data use, open and transparent public communication, accreditation or certification of health data processors, transparent and fair project approval processes, data de-identification and data security practices that meet legal requirements and public expectations without compromising data utility and a process to continually assess and renew the data governance framework as new data and new risks emerge."},{"id":"fe131d7f5a6b38b23cc967316c13dae2","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Innovation Contests","organization":[""],"authors":["David Pérez Castrillo","David Wettstein"],"paper_date":"3/16/2014","url":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2425517","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Quantitative Analysis"]},"sector":[""],"region":[""],"type":"working-paper","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"We study innovation contests with asymmetric information and identical contestants, where contestants’ efforts and innate abilities generate inventions of varying qualities.

The increase in scale of new crises, the urbanisation of many displaced populations, and stretched financing for humanitarian assistance are forcing international aid agencies to think and act in new ways. Along with other international humanitarian actors, several United Nations (UN) bodies are engaging with new tools and practices to bring innovation to the forefront of their work. Within these agencies, there has been a growing movement to establish ‘innovation spaces’ or ‘innovation labs’. These labs take different forms – some virtual, others physical – and each is created with its own motivations unique to the context in which it operates. Despite the variation, there is a growing trend in the UN system, and more broadly in the international humanitarian community, to create labs as a way to engage in and facilitate innovation practice. This research seeks to understand the way in which innovation labs across several UN agencies are being used to foster new ways of operating within the UN’s bureaucratic structures. We ask four key questions: What form do innovation labs in UN agencies take? What motivated their initiation? What are their aims and objectives? What impact have they had and how is the impact being measured? As innovation practice gains momentum, we reflect on the future of innovation spaces as a way to foster innovation within the UN system.

This paper seeks to address the need to develop an effective and legitimate Internet governance ecosystem by proposing a distributed yet coordinated framework that can accommodate a plurality of existing and emerging decision-making approaches. It draws on the lessons of open governance, adopting innovative techniques to facilitate coordination, information sharing, and evidence generation by and across increasingly diverse and global groups of Internet actors, and calls for creating practical tools to support such an effective, legitimate and evolving Internet governance ecosystem.

Traditionally, statistics has been used by the worker movement within the class conflicts. But in the current configuration of state restructuring, new accumulation regimes, and changes in work organization in capitalists societies, the activist use of statistics is moving. This first article seeks to show the use of statistics and quantification in contentious performances connected with state restructuring, main transformations of the varieties of capitalisms, and changes in work organization regimes. The double role of statistics in representing as well as criticizing reality is considered. After showing how important statistical tools are in producing a shared reading of reality, we will discuss the two main dimensions of statactivism – disclosure and affirmation. In other words, we will see the role of stat-activists in denouncing a certain state of reality, and then the efforts to use statistics in creating equivalency among disparate conditions and in cementing emerging social categories. Finally, we present the main contributions of the various research papers in this special issue regarding the use of statistics as a form of action within a larger repertoire of contentious action. Six empirical papers focus on statactivism against the penal machinery in the early 1970s (Grégory Salle), on the mobilisation on the price index in Guadalupe in 2009 (Boris Samuel), and in Argentina in 2007 (Celia Lury and Ana Gross), on the mobilisations of experts to consolidate a link between working conditions and health issues (Marion Gilles), on the production of activity data for disability policy in France (Pierre-Yves Baudot), and on the use of statistics in social mobilizations for gender equality (Eugenia De Rosa). Alain Desrosières wrote the last paper, coping with mobilizations proposing innovations in the way of measuring inflation, unemployment, poverty, GDP, and climate change. This special issue is dedicated to him, in order to honor his everlasting intellectual legacy."},{"id":"4734ba6f3de83d861c3176a6273cac6d","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Structuring Big Data to Facilitate Democratic Participation in International Law","organization":[""],"authors":["Roslyn Fulle"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2346188","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":[""],"region":[""],"type":"white-paper","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This is an interdisciplinary article focusing on the interplay between information and communication technology (ICT) and international law (IL).

Moreover, a central affordance of digitization is the ability to distribute, share and collaborate, and we have thus seen an “open theme” gaining currency in recent years.\n\nThese trends are reflected in the explosion of Open Data Initiatives (ODIs) around the world. However, while hundreds of national and local governments have established open data portals, there is a general feeling that these ODIs have not yet lived up to their true potential. This feeling is not without good reason; the recent Open Data Barometer report highlights that strong evidence on the impacts of open government data is almost universally lacking (Davies, 2013). This lack of evidence is disconcerting for government organizations that have already expended money on opening data, and might even result in the termination of some ODIs. This lack of evidence also raises some relevant questions regarding the nature of value generation in the context of free data and sharing of information over networks.

Here, one sees two extremes. On one hand, tremendous progress has been made in recent years in the understanding of causes, spread and remedies of common and regularly occurring diseases like Dengue, Malaria and Japanese Encephalistis (JE). On the other hand, public agencies treat these diseases in an ad hoc manner without learning from the experiences of previous years. Specifically, they would get alerted once reported cases have already arisen substantially in the known disease season, reactively initiate a few actions and then document the disease impact (cases, deaths) for that period, only to forget this learning in the next season. However, they miss the opportunity to reduce preventable deaths and sickness, and their corresponding economic impact, which scientific progress could have enabled. The gap is universal but very prominent in developing countries like India.\n\n \n\nIn this paper, we show that if public agencies provide historical disease impact information openly, it can be analyzed with statistical and machine learning techniques, correlated with best emerging practices in disease control, and simulated in a setting to optimize social benefits to provide timely guidance for new disease seasons and regions. We illustrate using open data for mosquito-borne communicable diseases; published results in public health on efficacy of Dengue control methods and apply it on a simulated typical city for maximal benefits with available resources. The exercise helps us further suggest strategies for new regions that may be anywhere in the world, how data could be better recorded by city agencies and what prevention methods should medical community focus on for wider impact."},{"id":"0e01938fc48a2cfb5f2217fbfb00722d","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Transparency in Search of a Theory","organization":[""],"authors":["Mark Fenster"],"paper_date":"2015","url":"http://est.sagepub.com/content/18/2/150.full.pdf+html","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Legitimacy"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":[""],"region":[""],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Transparency’s importance as an administrative norm seems self-evident.

Using an analogy to voting paradoxes, this review shows that reconciling multiple, inconsistent goals is a fundamentally challenging problem; the challenge leaves even deliberative individuals vulnerable to manipulation through nudges. The fact of inconsistent goals means that government regulators who deploy nudges select and impose their own objectives, instead of merely advancing the goals of the regulated.

The chapter notes how behavioural sciences need not depend on a top down approach but can incorporate citizen voice. The paper reviews how citizens and other groups can use behavioural cues to alter the behaviour of policy-makers in socially beneficial ways. The paper discusses how behaviourally informed measures could be integrated within the policy making process in ways that advance the effective use of evidence and nudge decision to make better policies."},{"id":"53c3bce66e43be4f209556518c2fcb54","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Navigating the Health Data Ecosystem: The \"Six C's\": Understanding the Health Data Terrain in the Era of Precision Medicine","organization":[""],"authors":["O'Reilly Media"],"paper_date":"5/2015","url":"http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/navigating-health-data-ecosystem.csp?imm_mid=0d28ad&cmp=em-data-na-na-newsltr_20150527","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis","Collective Intelligence"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":["Health"],"region":[""],"type":"research-report","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Data-driven technologies are now being adopted, developed, funded, and deployed throughout the health care market at an unprecedented scale.

Existing common law disclosure duties fail to capture a variety of non-medical factors relevant to patients, including information about the physician’s personal characteristics; the cost of treatment; the social implications of various health care interventions; and the legal consequences associated with diagnosis and treatment. Although there is a wealth of literature analyzing the merits of such disclosures in a few narrow contexts, there is little broader discussion and no consensus about whether there the doctrine of informed consent should be expanded to include information that may be relevant to patients but falls outside the traditional scope of medical materiality. This article seeks to fill that gap. \n\nI offer a normative argument for expanding the scope of informed consent disclosure to include non-medical information that is within the physician’s knowledge and expertise, where the information would be material to the reasonable patient and its disclosure does not violate public policy. This proposal would result in a set of disclosure requirements quite different from the ones set by modern common law and legislation. In many ways, the range of required disclosures may become broader, particularly with respect to physician-specific information about qualifications, health status, and financial conflicts of interests. However, some disclosures that are currently required by statute (or have been proposed by commentators) would fall outside the scope of informed consent – most notably, information about support resources available in the abortion context; about the social, ethical, and legal implications of treatment; and about health care costs."},{"id":"34ed066df378efacc9b924ec161e7639","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Social Innovation Lab Guide","organization":[""],"authors":["Frances Westley","Sam Laban","Cheryl Rose","Katharine McGowan","Kirsten Robinson","Ola Tjornbo","Mark Tovey"],"paper_date":"2015","url":"http://uwaterloo.ca/waterloo-institute-for-social-innovation-and-resilience/sites/ca.waterloo-institute-for-social-innovation-and-resilience/files/uploads/files/10_silabguide_final.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Labs and Experimentation","Design Thinking"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework","Case Studies"]},"sector":[""],"region":[""],"type":"research-report","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"The Social Innovation Lab emphasizes not only imagining high potential interventions but also gaining system sight, redefining problems, and identifying opportunities in the broader context with the potential to tip systems in positive directions.

Similarly, behavioral scientists now have access to“big data”sets–those from Twitter and Facebook, for example–that did not exist a few years ago. Studies of human dynamics based on these data sets are novel and exciting but, if not placed in context, can foster the misconception that mass-scale online behavior is all we need to understand, for example, how humans make decisions. To overcome that misconception, we draw on the field of discrete-choice theory to create a multiscale comparative “map” that, like a principal-components representation, captures the essence of decision making along two axes: (1) an east–west dimension that represents the degree to which an agent makes a decision independently versus one that is socially influenced, and(2) a north–south dimension that represents the degree to which there is transparency in the payoffs and risks associated with the decisions agents make. We divide the map into quadrants, each of which features a signature behavioral pattern. When taken together, the map and its signatures provide an easily understood empirical framework for evaluating how modern collective behavior may be changing in the digital age, including whether behavior is becoming more individualistic, as people seek outexactly what they want, or more social, as people become more inextricably linked, even“herdlike,” in their decision making.We believe the map will lead to many new testable hypotheses concerning human behavior as well as to similar applications throughout the social sciences."},{"id":"06eb61b839a0cefee4967c67ccb099dc","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Medical Wikis Dedicated to Clinical Practice: A Systematic Review","organization":[""],"authors":["Alexandre Brulet","Guy Llorca","Laurent Letrilliart"],"paper_date":"2/1/2015","url":"http://www.jmir.org/2015/2/e48/","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Comparative Analysis"]},"sector":["Health"],"region":[""],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Background: Wikis may give clinician communities the opportunity to build knowledge relevant to their practice. The only previous study reviewing a set of health-related wikis, without specification of purpose or audience, globally showed a poor reliability.\nObjective: Our aim was to review medical wiki websites dedicated to clinical practices.\nMethods: We used Google in ten languages, PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, and Web of Science to identify websites. The review included wiki sites, accessible and operating, having a topic relevant for clinical medicine, targeting physicians or medical students. Wikis were described according to their purposes, platform, management, information framework, contributions, content, and activity. Purposes were classified as “encyclopedic” or “non-encyclopedic”. The information framework quality was assessed based on the Health On the Net (HONcode) principles for collaborative websites, with additional criteria related to users’ transparency and editorial policy. From a sample of five articles per wikis, we assessed the readability using the Flesch test and compared articles according to the wikis’ main purpose. Annual editorial activities were estimated using the Google engine.\nResults: Among 25 wikis included, 11 aimed at building an encyclopedia, five a textbook, three lessons, two oncology protocols, one a single article, and three at reporting clinical cases. Sixteen wikis were specialized with specific themes or disciplines. Fifteen wikis were using MediaWiki software as-is, three were hosted by online wiki farms, and seven were purpose-built. Except for one MediaWiki-based site, only purpose-built platforms managed detailed user disclosures. The owners were ten organizations, six individuals, four private companies, two universities, two scientific societies, and one unknown. Among 21 open communities, 10 required users’ credentials to give editing rights. The median information framework quality score was 6 out of 16 (range 0-15). Beyond this score, only one wiki had standardized peer-reviews. Physicians contributed to 22 wikis, medical learners to nine, and lay persons to four. Among 116 sampled articles, those from encyclopedic wikis had more videos, pictures, and external resources, whereas others had more posology details and better readability. The median creation year was 2007 (1997-2011), the median number of content pages was 620.5 (3-98,039), the median of revisions per article was 17.7 (3.6-180.5) and 0.015 of talk pages per article (0-0.42). Five wikis were particularly active, whereas six were declining. Two wikis have been discontinued after the completion of the study.\nConclusions: The 25 medical wikis we studied present various limitations in their format, management, and collaborative features. Professional medical wikis may be improved by using clinical cases, developing more detailed transparency and editorial policies, and involving postgraduate and continuing medical education learners."},{"id":"9dfcd5e558dfa04aaf37f137a1d9d3e5","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Online Political Participation: A Study of Youth Usage of New Media ","organization":[""],"authors":["Ali Salman","Suhana Saad"],"paper_date":"8/1/2015","url":"http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/mjss/article/view/7264","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Survey"]},"sector":[""],"region":[""],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"The Internet is considered a huge development in human civilization.

The data was analysed descriptively and inferentially using SPSS 20.0 From the results, majority of the respondents, 89% are social media users having a social media account. A discouraging trend with regard to participation is the very low level of giving comments on general societal issues ranging from social issues, the environment to politics. The youth are more inclined to using the new media for entertainment and social networking. It is time to use the new media to engage with community leaders and politicians and comment on issues related to political issues.

We propose a balancing framework to help public authorities address this question in different contexts. The framework takes into account different levels of privacy risks for different types of data. It also separates decisions about access and re-use, and highlights a range of different disclosure routes. A circumstance catalogue lists factors that might be considered when assessing whether, under which conditions, and how a dataset can be released.

We account for its development over time, and what strands of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms.\n\nResults: Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935), but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms has emerged for the collection and classification of data."},{"id":"caf1a3dfb505ffed0d024130f58c5cfa","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"When Does ICT-Enabled Citizen Voice Lead to Government Responsiveness?","organization":["World Bank Digital Engagement Evaluation Team"],"authors":["Tiago Peixoto","Jonathan Fox"],"paper_date":"1/1/2016","url":"http://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/23650/WDR16-BP-When-Does-ICT-Enabled-Citizen-Voice-Peixoto-Fox.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Case Studies"]},"sector":[""],"region":[""],"type":"working-paper","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"This paper reviews evidence on the use of 23 information and communication technology (ICT) platforms\n to project citizen voice to improve public service delivery.

In particular, the use of Twitter data and crowdsourced text messages during crisis events such as Hurricane Sandy and the Haiti Earthquake raised questions about the ways in which crisis data act as a system of knowledge. We analyze these events from ontological, epistemological, and ethical perspectives and assess the challenges of data collection, analysis and deployment. While privacy concerns are often dismissed when data is scraped from public-facing platforms such as Twitter, we suggest that the kinds of personal information shared during a crisis—often as a way to find assistance and support—present ongoing risks.

In this article, I explore how the United Nations High Commission for Refugees' (UNHRC) repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan between 2002 and 2007 constitutes a case of humanitarian experimentation because of how the UNHCR deployed iris recognition technology to control the flow of refugees across the Afghan/Pakistan border. I argue that the UNHCR's use of iris recognition technology not only served to detect ‘deserving’ refugees, correct refugee movements, and innovate a manageable refugee. It also cultivated technological failures, corrected the technology's performance and linked local refugee databases to international biometric databases, all of which potentially introduced new insecurities into this border region and beyond. The effect of humanitarian experimentation in this case was to render the safety of refugees subordinate to the production of apparently safe technologies, so much so that refugees subjected to humanitarian experimentation in the world's dangerous ‘wild zones’ delivered ‘safety’ (by delivering presumably safer technologies) to citizens in the world's relatively secure ‘tame zones’ – not the other way around. In this way, the UNHCR's use of iris recognition technology made design safe for some citizens, but not for others."},{"id":"c042f4db68f23406c6cecf84a7ebb0fe","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Cosed","title":"The humanitarian cyberspace: shrinking space or an expanding frontier?","organization":[""],"authors":["Kristin Bergtora Sandvik"],"paper_date":"11/27/2015","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01436597.2015.1043992","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis"],"objective":["Legitimacy","Security"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":["Human Rights"],"region":[""],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"In an effort to contribute to a more critical understanding of the role of information and communication technology (ICT) in humanitarian action, this article explores the topography of the ‘humanitarian cyberspace’ – a composite of ‘cyberspace’ and ‘humanitarian space’ – as it has emerged since the mid-1990s.

These assumptions stand in tension with critical geographic scholarship, and in particular critical GIS research. In this paper I borrow from critical research on technologies to engage three important new facets of Big Data emerging from an interrogation of digital humanitarianism. I argue first that within digital humanitarianism, Big Data should be understood as a new set of practices, in addition to its usual conception as data and analytics technologies. Second, I argue that Big Data constitutes a distinct epistemology that obscures many forms of knowledge in crises and emergencies and produces a limited understanding of how a crisis is unfolding.

The analysis reveals sharp digital inequalities which map onto existing social inequalities. While some of our already better-off participants have access to a rich media landscape which they are able to navigate often reaping significant benefits, low-income participants are trapped in a delayed recovery with diminished social media opportunities. The fact that some participants are using social media to recover at a rapid pace while others are languishing behind represents a deepening of social inequalities.

Platforms now exist that permit collection of data from broad constituencies and rapid communication with endangered communities, but this new interface between the informality of “the crowd” and the formality of policy frameworks raises important questions. These questions pertain to best practices, ways to integrate crowdsourced data with more traditional sources of data, and the identification of tools and approaches that should be leveraged in particular contexts. Groups engaging with these tools to support disaster response are often from disconnected industries and institutions, compounding the challenges.

This project elaborates on the Centre’s earlier project on organisational accountability, particularly in seeking to develop the analytical framework and tools needed to implement certain key aspects of accountability. Specifically, the goals of this project are set forth in the following Project Vision Statement: Principle-based data privacy laws often leave room for interpretation, leaving it both to organisations to make appropriate decisions on how to implement these principles and to regulators on how to interpret and enforce the law. The Privacy Risk Framework Project aims to bridge the gap between high-level privacy principles on one hand, and compliance on the ground on the other, by developing a methodology for organisations to apply, calibrate and implement abstract privacy obligations based on the actual risks and benefits of the proposed data processing. While certain types of risk assessments are already an integral part of accountable organisations’ privacy management programs, they require further development. This project seeks to build consensus on what is meant by privacy risks to individuals (and society) and to create a practical framework to identify, prioritise and mitigate such risks so that principle-based privacy obligations can be implemented appropriately and effectively. On March 20, 2014, the Centre held a workshop in Paris during which more than 50 privacy experts, industry representatives and regulators discussed their experiences and views with respect to the risk-based approach to privacy, the privacy risk framework and methodology, as well as goals and next steps in this project. This paper, titled “A Risk-based Approach to Privacy: Improving Effectiveness in Practice”, is a developed version of the earlier discussion paper distributed to the participants of the workshop.

Unlike previous computational models that exploit personally identifiable information (PII) directly, such as behavioral targeting, big data has exploded the definition of PII to make many more sources of data personally identifiable. By analyzing primarily metadata, such as a set of predictive or aggregated findings without displaying or distributing the originating data, big data approaches often operate outside of current privacy protections (Rubinstein 2013; Tene and Polonetsky 2012), effectively marginalizing regulatory schema. Big data presents substantial privacy concerns – risks of bias or discrimination based on the inappropriate generation of personal data – a risk we call “predictive privacy harm.” Predictive analysis and categorization can pose a genuine threat to individuals, especially when it is performed without their knowledge or consent. While not necessarily a harm that falls within the conventional “invasion of privacy” boundaries, such harms still center on an individual’s relationship with data about her. Big data approaches need not rely on having a person’s PII directly: a combination of techniques from social network analysis, interpreting online behaviors and predictive modeling can create a detailed, intimate picture with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, harms can still result when such techniques are done poorly, rendering an inaccurate picture that nonetheless is used to impact on a person’s life and livelihood. In considering how to respond to evolving big data practices, we began by examining the existing rights that individuals have to see and review records pertaining to them in areas such as health and credit information. But it is clear that these existing systems are inadequate to meet current big data challenges. Fair Information Privacy Practices and other notice-and-choice regimes fail to protect against predictive privacy risks in part because individuals are rarely aware of how their individual data is being used to their detriment, what determinations are being made about them, and because at various points in big data processes, the relationship between predictive privacy harms and originating PII may be complicated by multiple technical processes and the involvement of third parties. Thus, past privacy regulations and rights are ill equipped to face current and future big data challenges. We propose a new approach to mitigating predictive privacy harms – that of a right to procedural data due process. In the Anglo-American legal tradition, procedural due process prohibits the government from depriving an individual’s rights to life, liberty, or property without affording her access to certain basic procedural components of the adjudication process – including the rights to review and contest the evidence at issue, the right to appeal any adverse decision, the right to know the allegations presented and be heard on the issues they raise. Procedural due process also serves as an enforcer of separation of powers, prohibiting those who write laws from also adjudicating them. While some current privacy regimes offer nominal due process-like mechanisms in relation to closely defined types of data, these rarely include all of the necessary components to guarantee fair outcomes and arguably do not apply to many kinds of big data systems (Terry 2012). A more rigorous framework is needed, particularly given the inherent analytical assumptions and methodological biases built into many big data systems (boyd and Crawford 2012). Building on previous thinking about due process for public administrative computer systems (Steinbock 2005; Citron 2010), we argue that individuals who are privately and often secretly “judged” by big data should have similar rights to those judged by the courts with respect to how their personal data has been used in such adjudications. Using procedural due process principles, we analogize a system of regulation that would provide such rights against private big data actors."},{"id":"aa942ab2bfa6ebda4840e7360ce6e7ef","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Accountability: Data Governance for the Evolving Digital Marketplace","organization":[""],"authors":["The Centre for Information Policy Leadership"],"paper_date":"2011","url":"http://www.huntonfiles.com/files/webupload/CIPL_Centre_Accountability_Data_Governance_Paper_2011.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis","Big Data","Data Governance"],"objective":["Legitimacy","Accountability"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":["Law"],"region":[""],"type":"white-paper","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"For the past three years, the Centre for Information Policy Leadership at Hunton & Williams LLP has served as secretariat for the Accountability Project.

Granting permission and aligning incentives are also necessary to institutionalize data-driven governance at the local level and create a culture of evidence-based decisionmaking that outlives individual political administrations.

Our case study suggests that, often, old ways of conceiving actors' interactions accompany the implementation of new communication tools, while the availability of a pervasive networked infrastructure does not automatically translate into meaningful interactions among all relevant actors in a specific domain."},{"id":"41f1f19176d383480afa65d325c06ed0","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"The New Power Politics: Networks and Transnational Security Governance","organization":[""],"authors":["Deborah Avant","Oliver Westerwinter"],"paper_date":"2016","url":"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-new-power-politics-9780190604509?cc=us&lang=en&#","taxonomy":{"category":["Distributed Governance"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework","Quantitative Analysis","Qualitative Analysis"]},"sector":["National Security"],"region":[""],"type":"book","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Traditional analyses of global security cannot explain the degree to which there is \"governance\" of important security issues -- from combatting piracy to curtailing nuclear proliferation to reducing the contributions of extractive industries to violence and conflict.

The framework rests on a fresh view of power and how it works in global politics. Though power is integral to governance, it is something that emerges from, and depends on, relationships. Thus, power is dynamic; it is something that governors must continually cultivate with a wide range of consequential global players, and how a governor uses power in one situation can have consequences for her future relationships, and thus, future power. \n\nUnderstanding this new power politics is crucial for explaining and shaping the future of global security politics. This stellar group of scholars analyzes both the networking strategies of would-be governors and their impacts on the effectiveness of governance and whether it reflects broad or narrow concerns on a wide range of contemporary governance issues."},{"id":"24b16fede9a67c9251d3e7c7161c83ac","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Design Principles for Engaging and Retaining Virtual Citizen Scientists","organization":["Center for Policy Informatics"],"authors":["Dara M.

The growth of virtual citizen science (VCS), facilitated through websites and mobile applications since the mid-2000s, has been driven by a combination of software innovations and mobile technologies, growing scientific data flows without commensurate increases in resources to handle them, and the desire of internet-connected participants to contribute to collective outputs. However, the increasing availability of internet-based activities requires individual VCS projects to compete for the attention of volunteers and promote their long-term retention. We examined program and platform design principles that might allow VCS initiatives to compete more effectively for volunteers, increase productivity of project participants, and retain contributors over time. We surveyed key personnel engaged in managing a sample of VCS projects to identify the principles and practices they pursued for these purposes and led a team in a heuristic evaluation of volunteer engagement, website or application usability, and participant retention. We received 40 completed survey responses (33% response rate) and completed a heuristic evaluation of 20 VCS program sites. The majority of the VCS programs focused on scientific outcomes, whereas the educational and social benefits of program participation, variables that are consistently ranked as important for volunteer engagement and retention, were incidental. Evaluators indicated usability, across most of the VCS program sites, was higher and less variable than the ratings for participant engagement and retention. In the context of growing competition for the attention of internet volunteers, increased attention to the motivations of virtual citizen scientists may help VCS programs sustain the necessary engagement and retention of their volunteers."},{"id":"ffd52f3c7e12435a724a8f30fddadd9c","related_content":[{"url":"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displaySuppMaterial?cupCode=1&type=4&jid=PSR&volumeId=108&issueId=03&aid=9327413&sessionId=CC69E58744D741A07ED364A13603DA95.journals","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"\"I wld like u WMP to extend electricity 2 our village\": On Information Technology and Interest Articulation","organization":[""],"authors":["Guy Grossman","Macartan Humphreys","Gabriella Sacramone-Lutz"],"paper_date":"8/2014","url":"http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPSR%2FPSR108_03%2FS0003055414000331a.pdf&code=217f5c3bd941bed57005a5003ed21b36","taxonomy":{"category":["Civic Technology","Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Case Studies"]},"sector":[""],"region":["Uganda"],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"How does access to information communication technology (ICT) affect who gets heard and what gets communicated to politicians?

The twentieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty, marked in 2013, was declared the European Year of the Citizen. Union citizenship has been understood as the world’s first post-national citizenship, although it is still complementary to national citizenships. EU citizens enjoy rights that have been expanded, modified, and reinterpreted in light of the EU integration process. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has been a driving force in this process. This twentieth anniversary has provided the occasio for this special issue. Indeed, much has happened over the last two decades. The Maastricht Treaty entered into force on the heels of German reunification, and afterwards, a series of EU treaties followed: The Amsterdam Treaty, the Nice Charter of Fundamental Rights, the aborted constitutionalization process and the Rome Treaty in 2004, and the Treaty of Lisbon. The Euro took over former national currencies in 2002; the enlargement process led to today’s twenty-eight Member States. But the ratio of this special issue is based on other events as linked to the 2008 financial crisis, bailouts, the fiscal compact, and similar measures. In a nutshell, the timeliness of this volume is linked to the current financial disarray. Since prognosis presupposes diagnosis, no further words are necessary as to the importance of this task. It is (almost) self-evident that before taking action and preparing for the future, one needs to address the very first question: Nosce te ipsum or know thyself.

Internet exchange points are the points of connection between different Internet networks, which enable different networks to exchange traffic at a shared facility without cost to either party through a process known as “peering”. Three different IXP governance models representing large and influential IXPs are compared: the DE-CIX in Frankfurt, CAIX in Cairo, and KIXP in Nairobi. DE-CIX, the largest IXP in the world, is a subsidiary of the German Internet trade association eco, and is thus “owned” by the Internet industry in Germany. Though well functioning, this has meant that key stakeholder groups such as civil society, and the academic and technical communities are excluded from participating in discussions over policy decisions. In contrast, the Cairo Internet Exchange Point (CAIX) is run by a public authority, the Egyptian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. Though it is governed by a broad set of stakeholders including private sector, government, and civil society representatives, its decision-making processes are somewhat opaque. Lastly, KIXP was founded by a Kenyan network engineer and is governed by a local trade association. While set up with multistakeholder coordination under the leadership of the private sector, its day- to-day operations and governance fall under private sector control. By tracing out the plurality of models used for IXP governance and comparing the processes of developing peering relationships, this case provides unique lessons for the governance process, particularly surrounding trade-offs between inclusiveness and effectiveness."},{"id":"dc912a253d1e9ba40e2c597ed2376640","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Labels as nudges?

It focuses on digital labour markets which allow the remote delivery of electronically transmittable services (i.e. Amazon Mechanical Turk, Upwork, Freelancers, etc.) and those where the matching and administration processes are digital but the delivery of the services is physical and requires direct interaction. The former broad type is called Online Labour Markets (OLMs) and is potentially global. The latter broad type is termed Mobile Labour Markets (MLMs) and is by definition localised. The essay defines and conceptualises these markets proposing a typology which proves to be empirically valid and heuristically useful. It describes their functioning and the socio-demographic profiles of the participants, reviews their economic and social effects, discusses the possible policy implications, and concludes with a research agenda to support European level policy making. It alternates the discussion of ‘hard’ findings from experimental and quasi-experimental studies with analysis of ‘softer’ issues such as rhetorical discourses and media ‘hyped’ accounts. This triangulation is inspired by, and a tribute to, the enduring legacy of the work of Albert O. Hirschman and his view that ideas and rhetoric can become endogenous engines of social change, reforms, and policies. This essay tries to disentangle the rhetoric with available empirical evidence in order to enable a more rational debate at least in the discussion of policies, if not in the public arena. To do so, an in depth analysis of 39 platforms was undertaken together with a formal review of 70 scientific sources. These two main sources have been integrated with: a) an exploration of 100 media accounts (business press, newspapers, magazines, and blogs); b) 50 reports and surveys produced by ‘interested parties’ (industrial associations, platforms own reports and public relation materials, think tanks with a clear political orientation, NGOs, trade unions, etc.); and c) about 200 indirectly relevant scientific contributions and policy reports (used as sources to contextualise and integrate the above sources, and to derive theoretical and interpretative insights). While the evidence is limited and inconclusive with respect to various dimensions, the findings of this essay show, among other things, that: a) individuals engage in these activities primarily for money, for a large segment of them this work is their primary source of income, and most are under-employed and self-employed and fewer are unemployed and inactive; b) matching frictions and hiring inefficiencies are widespread and even the OLMs are far from being globalised online meritocracies; c) a behavioural approach to big data exploration should be further applied because there is emerging evidence of heuristic and biases contributing to hiring inefficiencies."},{"id":"d9fc5b73a8d78fad3d6dffe419384e70","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Mo' Data, Mo' Problems?

This new technology is changing not only companies but governments as well. Mexico and Brazil, two of the most influential countries in Latin America, are entering a new era and as a result, facing challenges in all aspects of public policy. Using Big Data, the Brazilian Government is trying to decrease spending and use public money better by grouping public information with stored information on citizens in public services. With new reforms in education, finances and telecommunications, the Mexican Government is taking on a bigger role in efforts to channel the country’s economic policy into an improvement of the quality of life of their habitants. It is known that technology is an important part for sub-developed countries, who are trying to make a difference in certain contexts such as reducing inequality or regulating the good usage of economic resources. The good use of Big Data, a new technology that is in charge of managing a big quantity of information, can be crucial for the Mexican Government to reach the goals that have been set in the past under Peña Nieto’s administration.

Anti-discrimination law and transparency alone, however, cannot do the job of curbing Big Data’s negative externalities while fostering its positive effects.\n\nTo rein in Big Data’s potential, we adapt regulatory strategies from behavioral economics, contracts and criminal law theory. Four instruments stand out: First, active choice may be mandated between data collecting services (paid by data) and data free services (paid by money). Our suggestion provides concrete estimates for the price range of a data free option, sheds new light on the monetization of data collecting services, and proposes an “inverse predatory pricing” instrument to limit excessive pricing of the data free option. Second, we propose using the doctrine of unconscionability to prevent contracts that unreasonably favor data collecting companies. Third, we suggest democratizing data collection by regular user surveys and data compliance officers partially elected by users. Finally, we trace back new Big Data personalization techniques to the old Hartian precept of treating like cases alike and different cases – differently. If it is true that a speeding ticket over $50 is less of a disutility for a millionaire than for a welfare recipient, the income and wealth-responsive fines powered by Big Data that we suggest offer a glimpse into the future of the mitigation of economic and legal inequality by personalized law. Throughout these different strategies, we show how salience of data collection can be coupled with attempts to prevent discrimination against and exploitation of users. Finally, we discuss all four proposals in the context of different test cases: social media, student education software and credit and cell phone markets. \n\nMany more examples could and should be discussed. In the face of increasing unease about the asymmetry of power between Big Data collectors and dispersed users, about differential legal treatment, and about the unprecedented dimensions of economic inequality, this paper proposes a new regulatory framework and research agenda to put the powerful engine of Big Data to the benefit of both the individual and societies adhering to basic notions of equality and non-discrimination."},{"id":"352fe25daf686bdb4edca223c921acea","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"The Small World Initiative: An Innovative Crowdsourcing Platform for Antibiotics","organization":[""],"authors":["Ana Maria Barral","Huda Makhluf","Nichole A.

Through a series of student-driven experiments, students collect soil samples, isolate diverse bacteria, test their bacteria against clinically-relevant microorganisms, and characterize those showing inhibitory activity. This is particularly relevant since over two thirds of antibiotics originate from soil bacteria or fungi. SWI’s approach also provides a platform to crowdsource antibiotic discovery by tapping into the intellectual power of many people concurrently addressing a global challenge and advances promising candidates into the drug development pipeline. This unique class approach harnesses the power of active learning to achieve both educational and scientific goals.\n\nFormulated in 2012 at Yale University by Jo Handelsman, the current Associate Director of Science at the White House, the course is now in 109 institutions in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and nine countries.

An impact map has been reconstructed using Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within this frame, the underlying communication activity signals in the CDR data have been analyzed and compared against rainfall levels extracted from data of the NASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number of active phones connected to each cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns in the most affected locations during and after the floods that could be used as signatures of the floods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment and population information awareness. The representativeness of the analysis has been assessed using census data and civil protection records.

The world watched as activists used social media to organize protests during the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Hong Kong’s Umbrella Revolution. Many governmental and community organizations changed their mission and function as they adopted new digital tools and practices. This book examines the use of “civic media”—the technologies, designs, and practices that support connection through common purpose in civic, political, and social life. Scholars from a range of disciplines and practitioners from a variety of organizations offer analyses and case studies that explore the theory and practice of civic media.\n\nThe contributors set out the conceptual context for the intersection of civic and media; examine the pressure to innovate and the sustainability of innovation; explore play as a template for resistance; look at civic education; discuss media-enabled activism in communities; and consider methods and funding for civic media research. The case studies that round out each section range from a “debt resistance” movement to government service delivery ratings to the “It Gets Better” campaign aimed at combating suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer youth.

For tools of this kind to achieve their full potential in improving policing, though, the legal system will need to adapt. One important change would be to understand police tactics such as investigatory stops of pedestrians or motorists as programs, not as isolated occurrences. Beyond that, the judiciary will need to grow more comfortable with statistical proof of discriminatory policing, and the police will need to be more receptive to the assistance that algorithms can provide in reducing bias."},{"id":"b9228e0962a78b84f3d5d92f4faa000b","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"Enhancing Public Innovation by Transforming Public Governance","organization":[""],"authors":["Jacob Torfing","Peter Triantafillou"],"paper_date":"7/2016","url":"http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/management/entrepreneurship-and-innovation/enhancing-public-innovation-transforming-public-governance?format=HB","taxonomy":{"category":["Institutional Innovation"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":[""],"region":[""],"type":"book","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Rising and changing citizen expectations, dire fiscal constraints, unfulfilled political aspirations, high professional ambitions, and a growing number of stubborn societal problems have generated an increasing demand for innovation of public policies and services.

The results signify a significant relationship between certain public values provided by public libraries with the propensity of citizens engaging government in an online environment. Our findings further indicate that varying public values generate different results in regard to the way citizens are stimulated to use public libraries to engage with government online.

This Article examines the downsides of experimentation, and in particular the potential for decentralization to lead to the production of information that exacerbates public choice failures. Standard accounts of experimentation and policy learning focus on information concerning the social welfare effects of alternative polices. But learning can also occur along a political dimension as information about ideological preferences, campaign techniques, and electoral incentives is revealed. Both types of information can be put to use in the policy arena by a host of individual and institutional actors that have a wide range of motives, from public-spirited concern for the general welfare to a desire to maximize personal financial returns. In this complex environment, there is no guarantee that the information that is generated by experimentation will lead to social benefits. This Article applies this insight to prior models of federalism developed in the legal and political science literatures to show that decentralization can lead to the over-production of socially harmful information. As a consequence, policy makers undertaking a decentralization calculation should seek a level of decentralization that best balances the costs and benefits of information production. To illustrate the legal and policy implications of the arguments developed here, this Article examines two contemporary environmental rulemakings of substantial political, legal, and economic significance: a rule to define the jurisdictional reach of the Clean Water Act; and a rule to limit greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity generating sector."},{"id":"8fe0093bb30d6f8c31474bd0764e6ac0","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Big Data Quality: a Roadmap for Open Data","organization":[""],"authors":["Paolo Ciancarini","Francesco Poggi","Daniel Russo"],"paper_date":"6/1/2016","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303513220_Big_Data_Quality_A_Roadmap_for_Open_Data","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis","Big Data","Open Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Case Studies","Quantitative Analysis"]},"sector":[""],"region":["Italy"],"type":"conference-proceedings","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Open Data (OD) is one of the most discussed issue ofBig Data which raised the joint interest of public institutions,citizens and private companies since 2009.

We performed an intensive study to explore the feasibility of using anonymized Web query logs to screen for the emergence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

We then went back many months before these landmark queries were made, to examine patterns of symptoms, which were expressed as searches about concerning symptoms. We built statistical classifiers that predicted the future appearance of the landmark queries based on patterns of signals seen in search logs.\n\nResults: We found that signals about patterns of queries in search logs can predict the future appearance of queries that are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

However, as this Article is the first to uncover, rulemaking stakeholders — including agencies, the President and members of the public — are now deploying politically tinged visuals to push their agendas at every stage of high-stakes, often virulently controversial, rulemakings. Rarely do these visual contributions appear in the official rulemaking record, which remains defined by dense text, lengthy cost-benefit analyses, and expert reports. Perhaps as a result, scholars have overlooked the phenomenon we identify here: the emergence of a visual rulemaking universe that is splashing images, GIFs, and videos across social media channels. While this new universe, which we call “visual rulemaking,” might appear to be wholly distinct from the textual rulemaking universe on which administrative law has long focused, the two are not in fact distinct. Visual politics are seeping into the technocracy.\n\nThis Article argues that visual rulemaking is a good thing. It furthers fundamental regulatory values, including transparency and political accountability. It may also facilitate participation by more diverse stakeholders — not merely regulatory insiders who are well-equipped to navigate dense text. Yet we recognize that visual rulemaking poses risks. Visual appeals may undermine the expert-driven foundation of the regulatory state, and some uses may threaten or outright violate key legal doctrines, including the Administrative Procedure Act and longstanding prohibitions on agency lobbying and propaganda. Nonetheless, we conclude that administrative law theory and doctrine ultimately can and should welcome this robust new visual rulemaking culture."},{"id":"fccb60fb512d13df5083790d64c4d5dd","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Mapping and Comparing Responsible Data Approaches","organization":["The GovLab","Centre for Innovation"],"authors":["Jos Berens","Ulrich Mans","Stefaan Verhulst"],"paper_date":"7/2016","url":"http://www.thegovlab.org/static/files/publications/ocha.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Data Analysis","Open Data","Data Collaboratives"],"objective":["Legitimacy","Privacy"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework","Comparative Analysis"]},"sector":["Crisis Response","Development","Human Rights"],"region":[""],"type":"research-report","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Recent years have witnessed something of a sea-change in the way humanitarian organizations consider and use data.

These two dimensions produce a 2 × 2 framework that hypothesizes which technologies and data-applications in smart cities are likely to raise people's privacy concerns, distinguishing between raising hardly any concern (impersonal data, service purpose), to raising controversy (personal data, surveillance purpose). Specific examples from the city of Rotterdam are used to further explore and illustrate the academic and practical usefulness of the framework.

How, for example, do consumers choose between climate-friendly products or services and alternatives that are potentially damaging to the climate but less expensive? The answer may well depend on the default rule. Indeed, climate-friendly default rules may well be a more effective tool for altering outcomes than large economic incentives. The underlying reasons include the power of suggestion; inertia and procrastination; and loss aversion. If well-chosen, climate-friendly defaults are likely to have large effects in reducing the economic and environmental harms associated with various products and activities. In deciding whether to establish climate-friendly defaults, choice architects (subject to legal constraints) should consider both consumer welfare and a wide range of other costs and benefits. Sometimes that assessment will argue strongly in favor of climate-friendly defaults, particularly when both economic and environmental considerations point in their direction.

The Bhoomi program on the digitization of twenty million land records is considered a ‘best practice’ model of ‘e-governance’ to be replicated in other parts of India and elsewhere in poor countries. The main findings, at two levels, contrast conventional wisdom. First the digitization of land records led to increased corruption, much more bribes and substantially increased time taken for land transactions. At another level, it facilitated very large players in the land markets to capture vast quantities of land at a time when Bangalore experiences a boom in the land market. These consequences have come about via the centralization of both land records and management away from the village panchayat to the district level.

As is well known, the information and communication technologies (ICTs) that IDRC has researched in developing country contexts for over 20 years have created massive upheaval in knowledge production, governance and business practices around the world (Benkler 2006). With this in mind, in the early 2000s, IDRC began to take up the work of people like Laurence Lessig (2007) and the free and open source software (FOSS) movement, and to collaborate with institutions like the Open Society Foundation and Shuttleworth Foundation, to do research on the role of copyright in harnessing and/or regulating the impacts of ICTs on social change processes."},{"id":"250cf8b51c773f3f8dc8b4be867a9a02","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Open ICT Ecosystems Transforming the Developing World","organization":[""],"authors":["Matthew Smith","Laurent Elder"],"paper_date":"2010","url":"http://itidjournal.org/itid/article/view/489/214","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":["Development"],"region":[""],"type":"conference-proceedings","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"In the years following 2008, developing countries as a whole may invest as much as US$100 billion annually in information infrastructure (Khalil & Kenny, 2008).

This transition to open development is driven both by societal and technological trends. Firstly, the current debate on development effectiveness is pushing NGOs to plan, monitor and evaluate their work more effectively. Secondly, the end of the traditional rich North vs. poor South thinking requires NGOs to rethink their role and organisational model, as local NGOs, the private sector and local governments increasingly take control over development work in their country. Thirdly, the public concern on poor development spending sparks NGOs to improve their transparency and accountability. Finally, the budget austerity of governments in the North put pressure on NGOs to find new ways to fund their development activities.

In recent years, there has been increased commitment on the part of national governments to proactively disclose information. However, much of the discussion on OGD is at the national level, especially in developing countries where commitments of proactive disclosure is conditioned by the commitments of national governments as expressed through the OGP national action plans. However, the local is important in the context of open data. In decentralized contexts, the local is where data is collected and stored, where there is strong feasibility that data will be published, and where data can generate the most impact when used. This synthesis paper wants to refocus the discussion of open government data in sub-national contexts by analysing nine country papers produced through the Open Data in Developing Countries research project.\n\nUsing a common research framework that focuses on context, governance setting, and open data initiatives, the study found out that there is substantial effort on the part of sub-national governments to proactively disclose data, however, the design delimits citizen participation, and eventually, use. Second, context demands diff erent roles for intermediaries and diff erent types of initiatives to create an enabling environment for open data. Finally, data quality will remain a critical challenge for sub-national governments in developing countries and it will temper potential impact that open data will be able to generate."},{"id":"0353ab4cbed5beae847a7ff6e220b5cf","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Open Data in Devoloping Countries – Emerging Insights from Phase 1","organization":[""],"authors":["Tim Davies"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"http://www.opendataresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/Phase%201%20-%20Synthesis%20-%20Full%20Report-print.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":["Development"],"region":[""],"type":"research-report","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"The state of knowledge on open data is advancing rapidly.

In this work, we investigate the viability of using CDR data combined with other sources of information to characterize the floods that occurred in Tabasco, Mexico in 2009. An impact map has been reconstructed using Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within this frame, the underlying communication activity signals in the CDR data have been analyzed and compared against rainfall levels extracted from data of the NASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number of active phones connected to each cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns in the most affected locations during and after the floods that could be used as signatures of the floods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment and population information awareness. The representativeness of the analysis has been assessed using census data and civil protection records. While a more extensive validation is required, these early results suggest high potential in using cell tower activity information to improve early warning and emergency management mechanisms."},{"id":"428fca9bc1921c25c5121f9da7815cde","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Crowdsourcing civility: A natural experiment examining the effects of distributed moderation in online forums","organization":["Center for Policy Informatics"],"authors":["Cliff Lampe","Paul Zube","Jusil Lee","Chul Hyun Park","Erik Johnston"],"paper_date":"3/1/2014","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260167595_Crowdsourcing_civility_A_natural_experiment_examining_the_effects_of_distributed_moderation_in_online_forums","taxonomy":{"category":["Citizen Engagement and Crowdsourcing","Distributed Governance"],"objective":["Participation"],"methodology":["Case Studies","Quantitative Analysis","Qualitative Analysis"]},"sector":["Internet Governance"],"region":[""],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Participation in discussions about the public interest can be enhanced by technology, but can also create an environment in which participants are overwhelmed by the quantity, quality, and diversity of information and arguments. Political participation is at a greater disadvantage than non-political activities in that participants from different parties already start out with established differences, which requires them to reach some form of common ground before progress can be made. Those seeking authentic deliberation are discouraged to participate when confronted with uncivil and inflammatory rhetoric. These issues are often exacerbated in online discussions, where lack of identity cues and low barriers to entry can lead to heightened incivility between participants, often labeled as “flaming” and “trolling”. This paper explores the extent to which moderator systems, tools online discussion forums use to manage contributions, can reduce information overload and encourage civil conversations in virtual discussion spaces. Using the popular website Slashdot as an example of sound moderation in a public discourse setting, we found that users move toward consensus about which and how comments deserve to be moderated. Using these findings, we explore how transferable these systems are for participation in public matters specifically to the unique attributes of political discussion. Slashdot's political forum provides a comparison group that allowed us to find quantitative and qualitative differences in political posting, comments, and moderation. Our results show that large scale, civil participation is possible with a distributed moderation system that enables regularly lively debates to be conducted positively because the system provides tools for people to enforce norms of civility."},{"id":"f1b6f2857fb6d44dd73c7041e0aa0f19","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"Discovering the Appropriate Role of Serious Games in the Design of Open Governance Platforms","organization":["Center for Policy Informatics"],"authors":["Tanya M.

Well-designed responsive participatory pathways can encourage individuals to take action on issues that are important to them while receiving value and enjoyment in contributing to the overall welfare of the state. However, many crowdsourcing programs do not achieve their intended targets or goals in part because people have little motivation to participate. Serious games are examined to address this challenge as they involve the integration of intrinsic human motivators with game mechanics or game dynamics into a website, service, community, campaign, or application to drive participation and engagement. Governments can supplement open governance platforms with characteristics of games to reshape and invigorate public participation if individuals have opportunities to participate through channels that are collectively and individually rewarding. Drawing on theory and an emerging body of examples this manuscript creates a framework for how governance organizations can integrate serious games into the design of open governance platforms to improve the understanding of how the platform affects the working relationship with the public when solving collective challenges. Contributions of serious games are how to foster dialog, educate, solicit feedback, and mobilize individuals. In identifying the characteristics that differentiate early projects that have succeeded with those that have struggled, we provide recommendations of how to cultivate voluntary and enthusiastic participation in open governance platforms– giving the public the opportunity and motivation to have an impact on the communities in which they live just as many already do in the virtual worlds in which they play."},{"id":"68ce199ec2c5517597ce0a4d89620f55","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"GitHub use in public administration in Canada: Early experience with a new open collaboration tool","organization":["Center for Policy Informatics"],"authors":["Justin Longo","Tanya M.

However, there are significant challenges in successful adoption. One reason for this difficulty stems from conflicting organizational structures; open innovation practices are primarily online, fluid, rapid, iterative, and often temporary, whereas the command and control hierarchical structure of organizations are intended to be stable and to complete sustained services. Another source of this difficulty for administrators who are designing and managing open innovation efforts for the first time. Most administrators in organizations rarely have extensive technological or socio-technical design background or training. Therefore, an entire new skill set is being developed on to use participatory platforms. Even if the design and tech know-how is part of an administrator's toolkit, they may not know how to effectively align the goals, language, and evaluation metrics for successful implementation of participatory efforts. More often than not, administrators are attempting to run an open innovation effort in addition to their other, primary duties. Finally, even though open innovation tools like participatory platforms have existed for several years, there is high fragmentation and silos of working knowledge, meaning that many administrators continue to experiment in de facto isolation.\n\nThis paper presents a case study of a public university that has made a purposeful effort to integrate open innovation values and practices into its organizational mission and work. To best understand the process of open innovation adoption and use, we interviewed administrative intermediaries who are primarily responsible for the design, management, and evaluation of open innovation platforms and programs. We explored intermediary administrators' experiences with open innovation adoption using organizational learning theory. We specifically asked questions along dimensions of design and management values, teamwork, and organizational innovation culture. We used theoretical pattern matching to explore how the experiences of interview respondents aligned with theoretical propositions of organizational learning. Our analysis provides detailed insights one best practices, challenges, and lessons learned in the design and management of participatory platforms within the organization. This study has four key findings to contribute to the management of open innovation practices in organizations. First, the best team and approaches cannot thrive within the right culture. Second, developing culture takes time and consistent and persistent work from administrators throughout the organization. Third, three types of hybridity were identified by intermediaries in the execution of their innovation effort. These include unintentional, segmented, and fluid hybridity arrangements. Fourth, administrative intermediaries can identify what is likely to lead to successful or unsuccessful implementation of open innovation platforms. These findings contribute a foundation about open innovation management that can assist other administrators in organizations seeking to integrate innovation and entrepreneurship practices into their core mission and daily activities."},{"id":"877a9ba7a98f75b90a9d49f53f15a858","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Emerging Implications of Open and Linked Data for Knowledge Sharing Development","organization":[""],"authors":["Tim Davies","Duncan Edwards"],"paper_date":"2012","url":"https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/2247","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Case Studies"]},"sector":["Development"],"region":[""],"type":"journal-article","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Movements towards open data involve the publication of datasets (from metadata on publications, to research, to operational project statistics) online in standard formats and without restrictions on reuse.

This evaluation provides an overview of what the impact of these activities have been on the wider open data policy world and on the research partners themselves."},{"id":"26337353b7962f533d78c762373b3318","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Supporting Sustainable Development with Open Data","organization":[""],"authors":["Fiona Smith","William Gerry","Emma Truswell"],"paper_date":"2015","url":"https://theodi.org/supporting-sustainable-development-with-open-data","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":["Development"],"region":[""],"type":"research-report","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"Open data can: i) more effectively target aid money and improve development programmes, ii) track development progress and prevent corruption, and iii) contribute to innovation, job creation and economic growth.\n\nTo achieve these aims, the development community must address many challenges, including: a weak enabling environment for open data publishing; poor data quality; a mismatch between the demand for open data and the supply of appropriate datasets; a ‘digital divide’ between rich and poor, affecting both the supply and use of data; and a general lack of quantifiable data and metrics.\n\nWith these challenges in mind, the report sets out ways that governments, donors and (international) NGOs – with the support of researchers, civil society and industry – can apply open data to help make the SDGs a reality:\n\n1.

To date, more than 75% of the local government units in the country have complied. This research investigates whether the provision of local government information through government websites has affected both the providers of the information and its supposed audience – the public, as represented by citizen groups. To answer the questions, the researchers made use of a case study approach by selecting three provinces as research sites. The primary methods used were review of secondary data, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews.\rThe research found out two major significant findings. On the supply side, incentivising openness is a critical aspect in ensuring that local governments have the interest to disclose financial data. While at this stage, local governments are still on compliance behaviour, it encourages the once reluctant LGUs to disclose financial information in the use of public funds, especially when technology and institutional arrangements are in place. However, LGUs do not make an effort to inform the public that information is available online and has not made data accessible in such a way that it can allow the public to perform computations and analysis. Currently, no data standards have been made yet by the Philippine national government in terms of format and level of detail. On the demand side, there is limited awareness on the part of the public, and more particularly the intermediaries (e.g. business groups, civil society organizations, research institutions), on the availability of data, and thus, its limited use. As most of these data are financial in nature, it requires a certain degree of competence and expertise so that they will be able to make use of the data in demanding from government better services and accountability.\rThis paper argues that openness is not just about governments putting meaningful government data out into the public domain, but also about making the public meaningfully engage with governments through the use of open government data. This requires policies that will require observance of open government data standards and a capacity building process of ensuring that the public, to whom the data is intended, are aware and able to use the data in ensuring more transparent and accountable governance."},{"id":"2050e03ca119580f74cca14cc6e97462","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Enhancing Citizen Engagement Through Open Government Data","organization":[""],"authors":["Michael Canares","Dave Marcial","Marijoe Narca"],"paper_date":"2015","url":"http://www.opendataresearch.org/dl/symposium2015/odrs2015-paper15.pdf","taxonomy":{"category":["Open Data"],"objective":["Effectiveness","Participation"],"methodology":["Case Studies"]},"sector":["Development"],"region":["Philippines"],"type":"research-report","tools":[""],"github":"","abstract":"The research deals primarily with the research question – How can engagement of civil society organizations with open government data be instigated or enhanced?
