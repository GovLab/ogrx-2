  short_description: >
    <p>Having good data is a vital step to making progress on social goals. However, open data is only valuable insofar as it is relevant to the concerns of society, and actually being used to improve people’s lives.  Open Knowledge International is a global non-profit organisation focussing on realising open data’s value to society - by helping civil society groups to take action on urgent societal problems using data.</p>
    <p>Open Knowledge International addresses this in three steps: 1) we show the value of open data for the work of civil society organizations; 2) we provide organizations with the tools and skills to effectively use open data; and 3) we make government information systems responsive to civil society.</p>

  short_description: >
    <p>Convened and organized by the GovLab, and made possible by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Opening Governance seeks to build an empirical foundation and fundamental understanding of how the redesign of democratic institutions influences effectiveness and legitimacy in governance, to the end of improving people’s lives. A core group of fifteen members is complemented by an advisory network of academics, technologists, and current and former government officials. Through both face-to-face and online collaboration, the Network is focused on assessing existing innovations in governing and experimenting with new practices and, eventually new norms, for how our institutions make decisions at the local, national, and international level.</p>
