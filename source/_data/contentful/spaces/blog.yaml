    abstract: Volunteered geographical information (VGI) and citizen science have
      become important sources data for much scientific research. In the domain of
      land cover, crowdsourcing can provide a high temporal resolution data to support
      different analyses of landscape processes. However, the scientists may have
      little control over what gets recorded by the crowd, providing a potential source
      of error and uncertainty. This study compared analyses of crowdsourced land
      cover data that were contributed by different groups, based on nationality (labelled
      Gondor and Non-Gondor) and on domain experience (labelled Expert and Non-Expert).
      The analyses used a geographically weighted model to generate maps of land cover
      and compared the maps generated by the different groups. The results highlight
      the differences between the maps how specific land cover classes were under-
      and over-estimated. As crowdsourced data and citizen science are increasingly
      used to replace data collected under the designed experiment, this paper highlights
      the importance of considering between group variations and their impacts on
      the results of analyses. Critically, differences in the way that landscape features
      are conceptualised by different groups of contributors need to be considered
      when using crowdsourced data in formal scientific analyses. The discussion considers
      the potential for variation in crowdsourced data, the relativist nature of land
      cover and suggests a number of areas for future research. The key finding is
      that the veracity of citizen science data is not the critical issue per se.
      Rather, it is important to consider the impacts of differences in the semantics,
      affordances and functions associated with landscape features held by different
      groups of crowdsourced data contributors.

    abstract: 'Cybernetics, or self-governance of animal and machine, requires the
      ability to sense the world and to act on it in an appropriate manner. Likewise,
      self-governance of a human society requires groups of people to collectively
      sense and act on their environment. I argue that the evolution of political
      systems is characterized by a series of innovations that attempt to solve (among
      others) two ‘scalability’ problems: scaling up a group’s ability to make sense
      of an increasingly complex world, and to cooperate in increasingly larger groups.
      I then explore some recent efforts toward using the Internet and social media
      to provide alternative means for addressing these scalability challenges, under
      the banners of crowdsourcing and computer-supported argumentation. I present
      some lessons from those efforts about the limits of technology, and the research
      directions more likely to bear fruit.'

    abstract: Citizen sensing, or the use of low-cost and accessible digital technologies
      to monitor environments, has contributed to new types of environmental data
      and data practices. Through a discussion of participatory research into air
      pollution sensing with residents of northeastern Pennsylvania concerned about
      the effects of hydraulic fracturing, we examine how new technologies for generating
      environmental data also give rise to new problems for analysing and making sense
      of citizen-gathered data. After first outlining the citizen data practices we
      collaboratively developed with residents for monitoring air quality, we then
      describe the data stories that we created along with citizens as a method and
      technique for composing data. We further mobilise the concept of ‘just good
      enough data’ to discuss the ways in which citizen data gives rise to alternative
      ways of creating, valuing and interpreting datasets. We specifically consider
      how environmental data raises different concerns and possibilities in relation
      to Big Data, which can be distinct from security or social media studies. We
      then suggest ways in which citizen datasets could generate different practices
      and interpretive insights that go beyond the usual uses of environmental data
      for regulation, compliance and modelling to generate expanded data citizenships.

    abstract: |-
      Data collaboratives present a new form of cross-sector
      and public-private partnership to leverage (often
      corporate) data for addressing a societal challenge.
      They can be seen as the latest attempt to make data
      accessible to solve public problems. Although an
      increasing number of initiatives can be found, there is
      hardly any analysis of these emerging practices. This
      paper seeks to develop a taxonomy of forms of data
      collaboratives. The taxonomy consists of six dimensions
      related to data sharing and eight dimensions related to
      data use. Our analysis shows that data collaboratives
      exist in a variety of models. The taxonomy can help
      organizations to find a suitable form when shaping their
      efforts to create public value from corporate and other
      data. The use of data is not only dependent on the
      organizational arrangement, but also on aspects like the
      type of policy problem, incentives for use, and the
      expected outcome of data collaborative.

    abstract: 'Participation is a concept and practice that governs many aspects of
      new media and new publics. There are a wide range of attempts to create more
      of it and a surprising lack of theorization. In this paper I attempt to present
      a “grammar” of participation by looking at three cases where participation has
      been central in the contemporary moment of new, social media and the Internet
      as well as in the past, stretching back to the 1930s: citizen participation
      in public administration, workplace participation, and participatory international
      development. Across these three cases I demonstrate that the grammar of participation
      shifts from a language of normative enthusiasm to one of critiques of co-optation
      and bureaucratization and back again. I suggest that this perpetually aspirational
      logic results in the problem of “too much democracy in all the wrong places.”'

  title: 'Toward Evidence-Based Open Governance by Curating and Exchanging Research:
    OGRX 2.0'
  author:

  highlight: OGRX seeks to improve the visibility and accessibility of open governance
    research – across domains like open data, crowdsourcing and civic tech
  post: "The Open Governance Research Exchange (OGRX) is a platform that seeks to
    identify, collect and share curated insights on new ways of solving public problems.
    It was created last year by founding partners [the GovLab](http://ogrx.org/organizations/the-govlab.html),
    [World Bank Digital Engagement Evaluation Team](http://ogrx.org/organizations/world-bank-digital-engagement-evaluation-team.html)
    and [mySociety](http://ogrx.org/organizations/mysociety.html). Today, while more
    than 3000 representatives from more than 70 countries are gathering in Paris for
    the Open Government Partnership Summit, we are launching OGRX 2.0 with new features
    and functionalities to further help users identify the signal in the noise of
    research and evidence on more innovative means of governing.\n \n__What are the
    goals behind OGRX?__\n\nThe field of research on topics falling under the banner
    of open governance is rapidly growing and evolving. Identifying the most important
    findings remains challenging, however, and important work often resides behind
    paywalls. OGRX seeks to improve the visibility and accessibility of open governance
    research – across domains like open data, crowdsourcing and civic tech – through
    curation, a [submission form](http://ogrx.org/submit.html) for users to share
    important publications and a detailed taxonomy to help users browse and find the
    research that fits their needs.\n \n__What is new?__\n\nFirst, the new __OGRX
    Blog__ provides an outlet for more easily digestible and shareable insights from
    the open governance research community. OGRX currently features over 600 publications
    on governance innovation – but how to digest and identify insights? This space
    will provide summaries of important works, analyses of key trends in the field
    of research, and guest posts from researchers working at the leading edge of governance
    innovation across regions and domains. Check back often to stay on top of what’s
    new in open governance research.\n \nSecond, the new __OGRX Selected Readings__
    series offers curated reading lists from well-known experts in open governance.
    These Selected Readings will give readers a sense of how to jumpstart their knowledge
    by focusing on those publications that have been curated by those in the known
    about the topics at hand. Today we are launching this new series with the [Selected
    Readings on Civic Technology](http://ogrx.org/list/selected-readings-on-civic-technology.html),
    curated by mySociety’s head of research [Rebecca Rumbul](http://ogrx.org/authors/rebecca-rumbul.html);
    and the [Selected Readings on Policy Informatics](http://ogrx.org/list/selected-readings-on-policy-informatics.html),
    curated by [Erik Johnston](http://ogrx.org/by/author.html?filter=.f-erik-johnston)
    of the [MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Opening Governance](http://www.opening-governance.org/)
    and director of the Arizona State University Center for Policy Informatics. New
    Selected Readings will be posted each month, so check back often!\n \n__Help us
    develop this joint resource on Open Governance__\n\nThese new developments are
    only the beginning of our efforts to increase the utility of OGRX and work toward
    more evidence based open governance. Future efforts could include a forum for
    researchers to share insights and best practices and a project inventory to help
    researchers identify partners and avoid duplicative efforts. Watch this space
    and #OGRX to stay abreast of new developments.\n \nAnd if you are interested in
    becoming an OGRX partner, developing a Selected Readings list or penning a guest
    post for the OGRX blog, please contact Andrew Young, OGRX editor-in-chief at [andrew@thegovlab.org](mailto:andrew@thegovlab.org).
    We’d also love to hear your feedback on the platform and any ideas you might have
    about how to ensure that it is as useful to the community of open governance researchers,
    policymakers and practitioners as possible.\n\n\n"

      enabled by advancements in information technology, can help us work better,
      innovate, and solve complex problems. The first essay offers a collective sensemaking
      model to explain structurational processes in online communities. I draw upon
      Weick''s model of sensemaking as committed-interpretation, which I ground in
      a qualitative inquiry into Wikipedia''s policy discussion pages, in attempt
      to explain how structuration emerges as interpretations are negotiated, and
      then committed through conversation. I argue that the wiki environment provides
      conditions that help commitments form, strengthen and diffuse, and that this,
      in turn, helps explain trends of stabilization observed in previous research.
      In the second essay, we characterize a class of semi-structured prediction problems,
      where patterns are difficult to discern, data are difficult to quantify, and
      changes occur unexpectedly. Making correct predictions under these conditions
      can be extremely difficult, and is often associated with high stakes. We argue
      that in these settings, combining predictions from humans and models can outperform
      predictions made by groups of people, or computers. In laboratory experiments,
      we combined human and machine predictions, and find the combined predictions
      more accurate and more robust than predictions made by groups of only people
      or only machines. The third essay addresses a critical bottleneck in open-innovation
      systems: reviewing and selecting the best submissions, in settings where submissions
      are complex intellectual artifacts whose evaluation require expertise. To aid
      expert reviewers, we offer a computational approach we developed and tested
      using data from the Climate CoLab - a large citizen science platform. Our models
      approximate expert decisions about the submissions with high accuracy, and their
      use can save review labor, and accelerate the review process.'

      Open Policy is when governments, institutions, and non-profits enact policies and legislation that makes content, knowledge, or data they produce or fund available under a permissive license to allow reuse, revision, remix, retention, and redistribution. This promotes innovation, access, and equity in areas of education, data, software, heritage, cultural content, science, and academia.

      For several years, Creative Commons has been tracking the spread of open policies around the world. And now, with the new Global Open Policy Report (PDF) by the Open Policy Network, we’re able to provide a systematic overview of open policy development.

      screen-shot-2016-12-02-at-5-57-09-pmThe first-of-its-kind report gives an overview of open policies in 38 countries, across four sectors: education, science, data and heritage. The report includes an Open Policy Index and regional impact and local case studies from Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, Latin America, Europe, and North America. The index measures open policy strength on two scales: policy strength and scope, and level of policy implementation. The index was developed by researchers from CommonSphere, a partner organization of CC Japan.

    abstract: 'The technological, economic, and social changes of recent years have
      required governments to adapt to new challenges and growing demands from civil
      society. In many countries, and at different levels of government, this has
      led to the creation of innovation labs that aim to promote various modes of
      innovation within the public sector. This paper analyzes the roles of innovation
      labs in Latin America, examines the challenges, and compares them to best practices
      and characteristics that current literature associates with higher levels of
      innovation in the public sector and in other organizations. Based on a survey
      of lab directors and the undertaking of two case studies, this paper describes
      the scope of innovation labs in Latin America and discusses the challenges they
      face to (i) overcome key management issues, (ii) promote the adoption and scale
      up of innovation, and (iii) ensure its sustainability. There are four key factors
      that determine the success of innovation in overcoming these challenges: two
      of these are of a political and institutional nature, namely leadership support
      and political networks, while the other two relate to lab methodologies, namely
      the technical adaptation of innovation and the building of a shared meaning.
      Additionally, two major differences have been identified between the innovation
      labs discussed herein and those of other regions, as described in the existing
      literature: a greater focus on issues of open government and less rigorous testing
      of innovation, such as randomized experimentation and impact evaluation. Lastly,
      this study provides the relevant conclusions and recommendations on how to establish
      innovation labs as effective channels to manage innovation in government, along
      with its inherent risks, and modernize public administration.'

    abstract: This theme issue has the founding ambition of landscaping data ethics
      as a new branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related
      to data (including generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination,
      sharing and use), algorithms (including artificial intelligence, artificial
      agents, machine learning and robots) and corresponding practices (including
      responsible innovation, programming, hacking and professional codes), in order
      to formulate and support morally good solutions (e.g. right conducts or right
      values). Data ethics builds on the foundation provided by computer and information
      ethics but, at the same time, it refines the approach endorsed so far in this
      research field, by shifting the level of abstraction of ethical enquiries, from
      being information-centric to being data-centric. This shift brings into focus
      the different moral dimensions of all kinds of data, even data that never translate
      directly into information but can be used to support actions or generate behaviours,
      for example. It highlights the need for ethical analyses to concentrate on the
      content and nature of computational operations—the interactions among hardware,
      software and data—rather than on the variety of digital technologies that enable
      them. And it emphasizes the complexity of the ethical challenges posed by data
      science. Because of such complexity, data ethics should be developed from the
      start as a macroethics, that is, as an overall framework that avoids narrow,
      ad hoc approaches and addresses the ethical impact and implications of data
      science and its applications within a consistent, holistic and inclusive framework.
      Only as a macroethics will data ethics provide solutions that can maximize the
      value of data science for our societies, for all of us and for our environments.

    abstract: |
      Recognizing the potential of data innovation, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) innovation teams at the Regional Centre for Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (ECIS) and the Regional Hub for Arab States embarked on a “big data for development exploration journey,” seeking to harness new sources of data to improve services or programme implementation on topics including disaster risk management, improved welfare, migration, and poverty reduction. As part of this exercise, six UNDP Offices from the two regions developed data innovation proof-of-concept projects with governmental and civil society partners, to address urgent local challenges and gain hands-on experience in data innovation.

      UN Global Pulse provided technical guidance, coaching and tools to the project managers for the duration of the exercise, and the cohort shared advice and challenges at in-person workshops. This guide is based on these experiences, and on the methodology created by Global Pulse to design and implement data innovation projects across the UN system.

      The joint exercise showed how alternative sources of data can and should play a role in pursuing development outcomes and, as such, hold great promise for ful lling the Sustainable Development Goals—both from the perspective of pursuing the outcomes as well as enabling (close to) real-time monitoring and evaluation.

    In collaboration with OGRX partners, ILDA launches new Spanish-language open governance research exchange [RIGA](http://riga.idatosabiertos.org/).

    OGRX now features __800 curated publications__ on new ways to solve public problems.
  post: |-
    As innovators, policymakers, and researchers come together for this year’s ConDatos, it’s clear that data, and open data in particular, can create important new societal impacts. Open data, and other innovations like citizen engagement, civic technology platforms, and public sector innovation labs are transforming the relationship between governments and citizens, and introducing new pathways to solving major public problems. But how can data and other new problem-solving tools be leveraged in ways that improve governance and empower citizens?

    Originally launched in 2015, the Open Governance Research Exchange (OGRX) is a platform that seeks to identify, collect and share curated insights on new ways of solving public problems. OGRX was created by founding partners the GovLab, World Bank Digital Engagement Evaluation Team and mySociety to improve the visibility and accessibility of open governance research – across domains like open data, crowdsourcing and civic tech. Today OGRX features __800 publications__ exploring new and innovative ways to solve public problems.

    In view of the growth of the community that works and reflects on the use of technology to improve governance across Latin America, it became clear that there was a need for a space that not only curates the research in Spanish language but also collaborates with the promotion of the research about these subjects in the region.

    It's clear that Latin America has much to offer to the agenda of open data and civic tech. These developments are no longer framed as examples of developing countries trying to follow the agenda of first world countries, but as actions with their own weight and that contribute to the dialogue at a level of parity.

    In that sense, it is not only necessary to continue working on data policies, as well as on civil society initiatives in the area, but also to encourage applied and basic research, particularly in Spanish, in critical areas. In this way, [ILDA](https://idatosabiertos.org/) seeks to contribute to a greater development and publicity of academic production in the areas of open data and innovation in public management in Spanish language, as a key element in the promotion of these agendas in the region. In this context, with the collaboration of the GovLab and OGRX partners, [RIGA](http://riga.idatosabiertos.org/) was born.

    In this first stage, RIGA presents a limited number of studies and articles but, with the contribution of the  community in the coming months, we are confident the available resources will increase considerably. We will also post a number of selected readings on different topics as we continue to grow and expand the site. To learn more about new ways to solve public problems across Latin America – check out RIGA!

    abstract: "Crisis mapping has emerged as a method of connecting and empowering
      citizens during emergencies. This article explores the hyperbole behind crisis
      mapping as it extends into more long-term or ‘chronic’ community development
      practices. We critically examined developer issues and participant (i.e. community
      organization) usage within the context of local communities. We repurposed the
      predominant crisis mapping platform Crowdmap for three cases of community development
      in Canadian anglophone and francophone. Our case studies show mixed results
      about the actual cost of deployment, the results of disintermediation, and local
      context with the mapping application. Lastly, we discuss the relationship of
      hype, temporality, and community development as expressed in our cases.\n\n"

    abstract: "The Internet of Things is increasingly spreading into the domain of
      medical and social care. Internet-enabled devices for monitoring and managing
      the health and well-being of users outside of traditional medical institutions
      have rapidly become common tools to support healthcare. Health-related Internet
      of Things (H-IoT) technologies increasingly play a key role in health management,
      for purposes including disease prevention, real-time tele-monitoring of patient’s
      functions, testing of treatments, fitness and well-being monitoring, medication
      dispensation, and health research data collection. H-IoT promises many benefits
      for health and healthcare. However, it also raises a host of ethical problems
      stemming from the inherent risks of Internet enabled devices, the sensitivity
      of health-related data, and their impact on the delivery of healthcare. This
      paper maps the main ethical problems that have been identified by the relevant
      literature and identifies key themes in the on-going debate on ethical problems
      concerning H-IoT.\n\n"

    abstract: "Data-driven tools and techniques, particularly machine learning methods
      that underpin artificial intelligence, offer promise in improving healthcare
      systems and services. One of the companies aspiring to pioneer these advances
      is DeepMind Technologies Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Google conglomerate,
      Alphabet Inc. In 2016, DeepMind announced its first major health project: a
      collaboration with the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, to assist in
      the management of acute kidney injury. Initially received with great enthusiasm,
      the collaboration has suffered from a lack of clarity and openness, with issues
      of privacy and power emerging as potent challenges as the project has unfolded.
      Taking the DeepMind-Royal Free case study as its pivot, this article draws a
      number of lessons on the transfer of population-derived datasets to large private
      prospectors, identifying critical questions for policy-makers, industry and
      individuals as healthcare moves into an algorithmic age.\n\n"

      The Public Impact Gap is the difference
      between the outcomes a government
      is achieving and the outcomes it could
      be achieving. It works by comparing a
      government’s performance on a given
      outcome (for example, road traffic safety) to a
      stretching but achievable benchmark based on
      a group of peers.
      A country’s Public Impact Gap tells us how far
      that country lags behind its peers, and also
      what impact could be achieved if the Gap were
      to be closed (for example, the number of lives
      that could saved). While it is a relatively simple
      concept, we believe that the Public Impact Gap
      can be a useful tool in holding governments
      to account for delivering outcomes in areas
      of fundamental importance to each of us,
      including education, health, and safety.
      Highlighting where Public Impact Gaps
      exist is just the beginning of the story. The
      Centre for Public Impact has also set out the
      means to diagnose, address and close Public
      Impact Gaps by publishing the Public Impact
      Fundamentals – a free tool for governments,
      developed with leading academics to help
      leaders achieve better outcomes. This tool can
      be used in conjunction with the Public Impact
      Observatory, a free database of more than 200
      case studies, accessible via the Centre for
      Public Impact’s website.

      New computational and technical paradigms for cartography are accompanying the

      needs to focus its contemporary efforts on work that connects to outside disciplines
      and is grounded in problems that are important to humankind and its sustainability.

  title: 'The Open Governance Research eXchange (OGRX) expands to include 999 Papers
    and 18 Partners - Help us meet new milestones in 2018! '

  post: "The __Open Governance Research eXchange (OGRX)__ began with a few ideas and
    a few key partners seeking to develop answers and solutions to an important question:
    How to make  governance innovation more evidence based by making key findings
    on what works and why more accessible? \n\nAn ever-changing landscape not only
    requires innovation in how we seek to address major social problems. We also need
    to move away from faith based innovations to more evidence based ones -- promoting
    and leveraging research across disciplines, and sharing the findings that emerge
    in a succinct and streamlined manner. Enter OGRX, the first and only platform
    where innovators can access and search curated research from different disciplines
    and countries on opening governance.\n\nToday, [The Governance Lab](https://thegovlab.org)
    at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering and [its partners](http://ogrx.org/organizations.html)
    are pleased to announce two exciting milestones for the OGRX community: (1) the
    addition of three new partners, and (2) the growth of our repository of curated
    publications.\n\n## New Year, New Partners\n\n[Making All Voices Count](http://ogrx.org/organizations/making-all-voices-count.html),
    [Data for Policy](http://ogrx.org/organizations/data-for-policy.html) and [Open
    Culture Foundation](http://ogrx.org/organizations/open-culture-foundation.html)
    have joined OGRX as the new Contributing Partners, dedicated to advancing this
    platform, this community open governance practitioners and advocates, and to enhancing
    the scholarship of the growing area of governance innovation.\n\n- [Making All
    Voices Count](http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/) works at the intersection
    of technology, innovation, governance and civic engagement to promote transparency,
    combat corruption, empower citizens, and foster a more effective and accountable
    government. Making All Voices Count operates in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana,
    Mozambique, South Africa, Nigeria, Liberia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia and
    The Philippines. Information about some of its project is now available on OGRX,
    including its research on [citizen consultation platforms in Brazil](http://ogrx.org/papers/a-tale-of-two-consultations-online-participatory-practices-in-brazil.html),
    [interactive radio to improve accountability in Tanzania](http://ogrx.org/papers/exploring-the-potential-for-interactive-radio-to-improve-accountability-and-responsiveness-to-small-scale-farmers-in-tanzania.html),
    and [understanding the demand for open data among civil society actors in South
    Africa](http://ogrx.org/papers/what-data-do-we-want-understanding-demands-for-open-data-among-civil-society-organizations-in-south-africa.html),
    among many others. \n\n- [Data for Policy](http://dataforpolicy.org/) is an independent
    initiative launched in 2015 to build discourse around the theory and application
    of data science relevant to governments and policy research organizations through
    international conferences. Its works is also supported by a number of key stakeholders
    that include academic institutions, government agencies, nonprofits and businesses.
    Data for Policy brings together its stakeholders in an annual, international conference
    designed to focus on a topical and timely issue around using data for policy.
    From its inaugural conference in 2015 about big data, to its 2017 convening focused
    on data science, Data for Policy continues to create actionable ways for policy
    makers and others to become more data-driven. Papers from its most recent conference
    are available [here](http://ogrx.org/organizations/data-for-policy.html).\n\n-
    [Open Culture Foundation](https://ocf.tw/en/) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit founded
    in 2014 by several independent members of Taiwan’s open source community. OCF’s
    main goal is to support local community advocates to use open technologies in
    broader sectors, including open source software, open hardware, and open data.
    The Foundation also helps government, businesses and NGOs better understand the
    benefits of adopting open source, and promotes the importance of open data to
    other audiences, including the general public. OCF’s [Taiwan Open Government Report](http://ogrx.org/papers/taiwan-open-government-report-2014-2016.html),
    covering 2014-2016, is now available on OGRX. \n\nWe’re always looking to grow
    the OGRX platform with more curated content that expands the base of accessible,
    shareable knowledge about governance innovation. To do so requires collaboration
    from dedicated partners, thus we welcome the opportunity to add to our roster
    of innovative members. If you would like to join the OGRX community as a Network
    Partner, Contributing Partner and/or an Event Partner, please contact Andrew Young
    at [andrew@thegovlab.org](mailto:andrew@thegovlab.org), Director of Knowledge
    at The GovLab and Editor-in-Chief of OGRX.\n\n## From 999 to 1000, and Beyond\n\nWe
    are also thrilled to announce that the OGRX research platform now features 999
    books, research reports, journal articles, and other publications focused on new
    and innovative methods for problem-solving. This curated compendium is thanks
    to contributions from OGRX partners and other users and practitioners within the
    community.\n\n*__Which publication will help OGRX go from 999 to 1000 publications?__*
    Who will provide the next governance innovation piece to help OGRX reach this
    important milestone? Share your suggestions through the [OGRX Submission Form](http://ogrx.org/submit.html),
    and/or make your voice heard using [#OGRX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ogrx&src=typd)
    and tagging [@TheGovLab](https://twitter.com/TheGovLab?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
    on Twitter!\n\nIn the meantime, below are some recent additions to OGRX:  \n\n-
    [Gender Biases in Cyberspace: A Two-Stage Model, the New Arena of Wikipedia and
    Other Websites](http://ogrx.org/papers/gender-biases-in-cyberspace-a-two-stage-model-the-new-arena-of-wikipedia-and-other-websites.html)
    seeks to promote gender inclusive digital space by elaborating two stages through
    which the virtual world excludes women: first, by controlling websites and filtering
    out women; and second, by exposing women who survived the first stage as a hostile
    environment.\n\n- [Who Benefits From Civic Technology?](http://ogrx.org/papers/who-benefits-from-civic-technology.html)
    argues that only by knowing who is using civic technology can we begin to understand
    what, where and how significant the impact of civic technology can possibly be.\n\n-
    [Public Policy and the Promise of Digital Credit for Financial Inclusion](http://ogrx.org/papers/public-policy-and-the-promise-of-digital-credit-for-financial-inclusion.html)
    investigates the digital credit policy environment and its potential in supporting
    pro-poor digital credit market development using regulatory documents specifically
    mentioning either digital or online credit or lending, and informal documents
    relevant to digital credit based on a systematic web search\n\n- [Data Driven
    Decisions for Flood Risk Management](http://ogrx.org/papers/data-driven-decisions-for-flood-risk-management.html)
    discusses how flood risk management can be addressed through data driven decision
    making, communication, and community engagement.\n\n- [An (Increasingly) Visible
    College: Mapping and Strengthening Research and Innovation Networks with Open
    Data](http://ogrx.org/papers/an-increasingly-visible-college-mapping-and-strengthening-research-and-innovation-networks-with-open-data.html)
    analyzes the Gateway to Research, an open dataset about research funding and university-industry
    collaborations in the UK in a project to map innovation in Wales.\n\nAs governance
    continues to evolve, so will the need for different types of resources to support
    the research, analysis and implementation of governance innovations driven by
    academics, advocates, policy makers and others – across regions. Going forward,
    OGRX will continue its mission to identify, curate, and share this research. And
    for our Spanish-language colleagues, please check out [RIGA](http://riga.idatosabiertos.org),
    the Repositorio de Investigaciones Cuantitativa y Cualitativa sobre Innovaciones
    en Gobernanza. \n\n"

    abstract: 'Increasingly, there has been a focus on creating democratic standards
      and norms in order to best facilitate open exchange of information and communication
      online - a goal that fits neatly within the feminist aim to democratize content
      creation and community. Collaborative website, such as blogs, social networks
      and, as focused on in this article, Wikipedia, represent both a cyberspace community
      entirely outside the structures of the traditional (intellectual) proprietary
      paradigm and one that professes and truly embodies the philosophy of a completely
      open, free, and democratic resource for all. In theory, collaborative websites
      are the solution for which social activists, intellectual property opponents,
      and feminist theorists have been waiting. Unfortunately, we are now realizing
      that this utopian dream does not exist as anticipated: the Internet is neither
      neutral nor open to everyone. More importantly, these websites are not egalitarian;
      rather, they facilitate new ways to exclude and subordinate women. This article
      innovatively argues that the virtual world excludes women in two stages: first,
      by conrrolling websites and filtering out women; and second, by exposing women
      who survived the first stage as a hostile environment. Wikipedia, as well as
      other cyber-space environments, dmeonstrates the execution of the model, which
      results in the exclusion of women from the virtual sphere with all the implications
      thereof.'

    abstract: |
      Online and digital technologies that enable citizens to hold governments to account, known as civic technologies, are proliferating at a steady rate around the world. The potential for these platforms to invigorate citizen engagement, increase transparency, and broaden public debate has been recognized not only by those in civil society, but by governments, by development agencies, and by philanthropists. There is, however, frustratingly little evidence to demonstrate the real-world impact of such platforms. Indeed, there is a paucity of robust research on any aspect of civic technology.

      This report seeks to take a first step towards illuminating the world of civic technology. Whilst answering important, but complex questions concerning the impacts of civic technology is mySociety’s ultimate research goal, this research sought to begin at the beginning, asking the most basic questions about who actually uses civic technology and why. Only by knowing who is using civic technology can we begin to understand what, where and how significant the impact of civic technology can possibly be.

      The report identifies a number of areas for further research based upon the data collected, and concludes with a discussion on the implications of the findings that should provide much food for thought to civic technologists, governments and philanthropic organizations. mySociety’s long-term mission is to understand the impacts of civic technologies. But before they can be fully examined, we need better provision of the baseline facts. This report seeks to begin at the beginning, asking the most basic questions about who actually uses civic technology and why. Gathering data from civic technology groups from around the world, it shows the variations in usage of civic tech across four core countries (US, UK, Kenya and South Africa), and records the attitudes of users towards the platforms they are using.

    abstract: 'Digital credit products are characterized by a lending process that
      is instantaneous, automated, and remote. While digital credit has the potential
      to reach less collateralized, less mobile, and more remote cohorts of borrowers,
      there are also risks in relying on digital credit for financial inclusion. This
      paper investigates the digital credit policy environment and the extent to which
      it may support pro-poor digital credit market development using two types of
      documents: a set of 23 regulatory documents specifically mentioning either digital
      or online credit or lending, and another set of 298 informal documents relevant
      to digital credit based on a systematic web search. After reviewing the literature
      on the effects of credit expansion and automated credit scoring, we summarize
      the characteristics of the current digital credit regulatory environment in
      low- and middle-income countries. Our findings suggest that few regulations
      specifically target digital credit markets, and that the current regulatory
      environment may not support the full potential of digital credit to reach historically
      underserved credit consumers. Most countries do not explicitly target financial
      inclusion as part of their digital credit policies. However, we do find evidence
      that informal web documents consider financial inclusion to a greater extent
      than formal regulatory documents. '

    abstract: Ensemble is an interdisciplinary research team, working to explore the
      opportunity of new and emergent digital technologies in understanding, mitigating
      and adapting to environmental change. Using methods drawn from computer science,
      environmental science, social science, statistics, art, design and writing the
      team aim to transform the work of environmental scientists and decision makers,
      and the experience of communities by addressing themes related to complexity,
      uncertainty and abstraction of data. This paper discusses activities undertaken
      within a research ‘sprint’ directed at addressing flood risk management through
      data driven decision making, communication and community engagement.

    abstract: Innovation policymakers need timely, detailed data about scientific
      research trends and networks to monitor their evolution and put in place suitable
      strategies to support them. We have analysed the Gateway to Research, an open
      dataset about research funding and university-industry collaborations in the
      UK in a project to map innovation in Wales. We use supervised learning and Natural
      Language Processing to improve data coverage and measure activity in research
      topics, build a recommendation engine to identify new opportunities for collaboration
      in the Welsh innovation system, and present the results through interactive
      visualisations. Our results suggest that Wales is becoming more competitive
      in areas identified as strategic targets by Welsh Government, that its research
      ecosystem is geographically diversified, and that research collaborations tend
      to take place between organisations that are geographically close. The data
      sources and methods we have used in the project can help understand this system
      better, and support it more effectively.
