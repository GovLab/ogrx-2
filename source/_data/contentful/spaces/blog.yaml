  highlight: OGRX seeks to improve the visibility and accessibility of open governance
    research – across domains like open data, crowdsourcing and civic tech
  post: "The Open Governance Research Exchange (OGRX) is a platform that seeks to
    identify, collect and share curated insights on new ways of solving public problems.
    It was created last year by founding partners [the GovLab](http://ogrx.org/organizations/the-govlab.html),
    [World Bank Digital Engagement Evaluation Team](http://ogrx.org/organizations/world-bank-digital-engagement-evaluation-team.html)
    and [mySociety](http://ogrx.org/organizations/mysociety.html). Today, while more
    than 3000 representatives from more than 70 countries are gathering in Paris for
    the Open Government Partnership Summit, we are launching OGRX 2.0 with new features
    and functionalities to further help users identify the signal in the noise of
    research and evidence on more innovative means of governing.\n \n__What are the
    goals behind OGRX?__\n\nThe field of research on topics falling under the banner
    of open governance is rapidly growing and evolving. Identifying the most important
    findings remains challenging, however, and important work often resides behind
    paywalls. OGRX seeks to improve the visibility and accessibility of open governance
    research – across domains like open data, crowdsourcing and civic tech – through
    curation, a [submission form](http://ogrx.org/submit.html) for users to share
    important publications and a detailed taxonomy to help users browse and find the
    research that fits their needs.\n \n__What is new?__\n\nFirst, the new __OGRX
    Blog__ provides an outlet for more easily digestible and shareable insights from
    the open governance research community. OGRX currently features over 600 publications
    on governance innovation – but how to digest and identify insights? This space
    will provide summaries of important works, analyses of key trends in the field
    of research, and guest posts from researchers working at the leading edge of governance
    innovation across regions and domains. Check back often to stay on top of what’s
    new in open governance research.\n \nSecond, the new __OGRX Selected Readings__
    series offers curated reading lists from well-known experts in open governance.
    These Selected Readings will give readers a sense of how to jumpstart their knowledge
    by focusing on those publications that have been curated by those in the known
    about the topics at hand. Today we are launching this new series with the [Selected
    Readings on Civic Technology](http://ogrx.org/list/selected-readings-on-civic-technology.html),
    curated by mySociety’s head of research [Rebecca Rumbul](http://ogrx.org/authors/rebecca-rumbul.html);
    and the [Selected Readings on Policy Informatics](http://ogrx.org/list/selected-readings-on-policy-informatics.html),
    curated by [Erik Johnston](http://ogrx.org/by/author.html?filter=.f-erik-johnston)
    of the [MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Opening Governance](http://www.opening-governance.org/)
    and director of the Arizona State University Center for Policy Informatics. New
    Selected Readings will be posted each month, so check back often!\n \n__Help us
    develop this joint resource on Open Governance__\n\nThese new developments are
    only the beginning of our efforts to increase the utility of OGRX and work toward
    more evidence based open governance. Future efforts could include a forum for
    researchers to share insights and best practices and a project inventory to help
    researchers identify partners and avoid duplicative efforts. Watch this space
    and #OGRX to stay abreast of new developments.\n \nAnd if you are interested in
    becoming an OGRX partner, developing a Selected Readings list or penning a guest
    post for the OGRX blog, please contact Andrew Young, OGRX editor-in-chief at [andrew@thegovlab.org](mailto:andrew@thegovlab.org).
    We’d also love to hear your feedback on the platform and any ideas you might have
    about how to ensure that it is as useful to the community of open governance researchers,
    policymakers and practitioners as possible.\n\n\n"
