  title: 'Toward Evidence-Based Open Governance by Curating and Exchanging Research:
    OGRX 2.0'

  post: "The Open Governance Research Exchange (OGRX) is a platform that seeks to
    identify, collect and share curated insights on new ways of solving public problems.
    It was created last year by founding partners the GovLab, World Bank Digital Engagement
    Evaluation Team and mySociety. Today, while more than 3000 representatives from
    more than 70 countries are gathering in Paris for the Open Government Partnership
    Summit, we are launching OGRX 2.0 with new features and functionalities to further
    help users identify the signal in the noise of research and evidence on more innovative
    means of governing.\n \n__What are the goals behind OGRX?__\nThe field of research
    on topics falling under the banner of open governance is rapidly growing and evolving.
    Identifying the most important findings remains challenging, however, and important
    work often resides behind paywalls. OGRX seeks to improve the visibility and accessibility
    of open governance research – across domains like open data, crowdsourcing and
    civic tech – through curation, a submission form for users to share important
    publications and a detailed taxonomy to help users browse and find the research
    that fits their needs.\n \n__What is new?__\nFirst, the new OGRX Blog provides
    an outlet for more easily digestible and shareable insights from the open governance
    research community. OGRX currently features over 600 publications on governance
    innovation – but how to digest and identify insights? This space will provide
    summaries of important works, analyses of key trends in the field of research,
    and guest posts from researchers working at the leading edge of governance innovation
    across regions and domains. Check back often to stay on top of what’s new in open
    governance research.\n \nSecond, the new OGRX Selected Readings series offers
    curated reading lists from well-known experts in open governance. These Selected
    Readings will give readers a sense of how to jumpstart their knowledge by focusing
    on those publications that have been curated by those in the known about the topics
    at hand. Today we are launching this new series with the Selected Readings on
    Civic Technology [LINK], curated by mySociety’s head of research Rebecca Rumbul;
    and the Selected Readings on Policy Informatics [LINK], curated Erik Johnston
    of the [MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Opening Governance](http://www.opening-governance.org/)
    and director of the Arizona State University Center for Policy Informatics. New
    Selected Readings will be posted each month, so check back often!\n \n__Help us
    develop this joint resource on Open Governance__\nThese new developments are only
    the beginning of our efforts to increase the utility of OGRX and work toward more
    evidence based open governance. Future efforts could include a forum for researchers
    to share insights and best practices and a project inventory to help researchers
    identify partners and avoid duplicative efforts. Watch this space and #OGRX to
    stay abreast of new developments.\n \nAnd if you are interested in becoming an
    OGRX partner, developing a Selected Readings list or penning a guest post for
    the OGRX blog, please contact Andrew Young, OGRX editor-in-chief at [andrew@thegovlab.org](mailto:andrew@thegovlab.org).
    We’d also love to hear your feedback on the platform and any ideas you might have
    about how to ensure that it is as useful to the community of open governance researchers,
    policymakers and practitioners as possible.\n\n\n"

    warrior searching for a righteous cause. As the world fell, each of us in our
    own way was broken. \n\n> It was hard to know who was more crazy... me... or everyone
    else.\n\nI am the one that runs from both \n1. the living \n2. and the dead. \n\nHunted
    by *scavengers*, haunted by those I could not protect. So I exist in this wasteland,
    reduced to one instinct: __survive__."
