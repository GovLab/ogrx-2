    warrior searching for a righteous cause. As the world fell, each of us in our
    own way was broken. \n\n> It was hard to know who was more crazy... me... or everyone
    else.\n\nI am the one that runs from both \n1. the living \n2. and the dead. \n\nHunted
    by *scavengers*, haunted by those I could not protect. So I exist in this wasteland,
    reduced to one instinct: __survive__."
