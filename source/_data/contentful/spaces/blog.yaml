    abstract: 'This dissertation consists of three essays that advance our understanding
      of collective-intelligence: how it works, how it can be used, and how it can
      be augmented. I combine theoretical and empirical work, spanning qualitative
      inquiry, lab experiments, and design, exploring how novel ways of organizing,
      enabled by advancements in information technology, can help us work better,
      innovate, and solve complex problems. The first essay offers a collective sensemaking
      model to explain structurational processes in online communities. I draw upon
      Weick''s model of sensemaking as committed-interpretation, which I ground in
      a qualitative inquiry into Wikipedia''s policy discussion pages, in attempt
      to explain how structuration emerges as interpretations are negotiated, and
      then committed through conversation. I argue that the wiki environment provides
      conditions that help commitments form, strengthen and diffuse, and that this,
      in turn, helps explain trends of stabilization observed in previous research.
      In the second essay, we characterize a class of semi-structured prediction problems,
      where patterns are difficult to discern, data are difficult to quantify, and
      changes occur unexpectedly. Making correct predictions under these conditions
      can be extremely difficult, and is often associated with high stakes. We argue
      that in these settings, combining predictions from humans and models can outperform
      predictions made by groups of people, or computers. In laboratory experiments,
      we combined human and machine predictions, and find the combined predictions
      more accurate and more robust than predictions made by groups of only people
      or only machines. The third essay addresses a critical bottleneck in open-innovation
      systems: reviewing and selecting the best submissions, in settings where submissions
      are complex intellectual artifacts whose evaluation require expertise. To aid
      expert reviewers, we offer a computational approach we developed and tested
      using data from the Climate CoLab - a large citizen science platform. Our models
      approximate expert decisions about the submissions with high accuracy, and their
      use can save review labor, and accelerate the review process.'

      Open Policy is when governments, institutions, and non-profits enact policies and legislation that makes content, knowledge, or data they produce or fund available under a permissive license to allow reuse, revision, remix, retention, and redistribution. This promotes innovation, access, and equity in areas of education, data, software, heritage, cultural content, science, and academia.

      For several years, Creative Commons has been tracking the spread of open policies around the world. And now, with the new Global Open Policy Report (PDF) by the Open Policy Network, we’re able to provide a systematic overview of open policy development.

      screen-shot-2016-12-02-at-5-57-09-pmThe first-of-its-kind report gives an overview of open policies in 38 countries, across four sectors: education, science, data and heritage. The report includes an Open Policy Index and regional impact and local case studies from Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, Latin America, Europe, and North America. The index measures open policy strength on two scales: policy strength and scope, and level of policy implementation. The index was developed by researchers from CommonSphere, a partner organization of CC Japan.

    abstract: 'The technological, economic, and social changes of recent years have
      required governments to adapt to new challenges and growing demands from civil
      society. In many countries, and at different levels of government, this has
      led to the creation of innovation labs that aim to promote various modes of
      innovation within the public sector. This paper analyzes the roles of innovation
      labs in Latin America, examines the challenges, and compares them to best practices
      and characteristics that current literature associates with higher levels of
      innovation in the public sector and in other organizations. Based on a survey
      of lab directors and the undertaking of two case studies, this paper describes
      the scope of innovation labs in Latin America and discusses the challenges they
      face to (i) overcome key management issues, (ii) promote the adoption and scale
      up of innovation, and (iii) ensure its sustainability. There are four key factors
      that determine the success of innovation in overcoming these challenges: two
      of these are of a political and institutional nature, namely leadership support
      and political networks, while the other two relate to lab methodologies, namely
      the technical adaptation of innovation and the building of a shared meaning.
      Additionally, two major differences have been identified between the innovation
      labs discussed herein and those of other regions, as described in the existing
      literature: a greater focus on issues of open government and less rigorous testing
      of innovation, such as randomized experimentation and impact evaluation. Lastly,
      this study provides the relevant conclusions and recommendations on how to establish
      innovation labs as effective channels to manage innovation in government, along
      with its inherent risks, and modernize public administration.'

    abstract: This theme issue has the founding ambition of landscaping data ethics
      as a new branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related
      to data (including generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination,
      sharing and use), algorithms (including artificial intelligence, artificial
      agents, machine learning and robots) and corresponding practices (including
      responsible innovation, programming, hacking and professional codes), in order
      to formulate and support morally good solutions (e.g. right conducts or right
      values). Data ethics builds on the foundation provided by computer and information
      ethics but, at the same time, it refines the approach endorsed so far in this
      research field, by shifting the level of abstraction of ethical enquiries, from
      being information-centric to being data-centric. This shift brings into focus
      the different moral dimensions of all kinds of data, even data that never translate
      directly into information but can be used to support actions or generate behaviours,
      for example. It highlights the need for ethical analyses to concentrate on the
      content and nature of computational operations—the interactions among hardware,
      software and data—rather than on the variety of digital technologies that enable
      them. And it emphasizes the complexity of the ethical challenges posed by data
      science. Because of such complexity, data ethics should be developed from the
      start as a macroethics, that is, as an overall framework that avoids narrow,
      ad hoc approaches and addresses the ethical impact and implications of data
      science and its applications within a consistent, holistic and inclusive framework.
      Only as a macroethics will data ethics provide solutions that can maximize the
      value of data science for our societies, for all of us and for our environments.

    abstract: |
      Recognizing the potential of data innovation, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) innovation teams at the Regional Centre for Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (ECIS) and the Regional Hub for Arab States embarked on a “big data for development exploration journey,” seeking to harness new sources of data to improve services or programme implementation on topics including disaster risk management, improved welfare, migration, and poverty reduction. As part of this exercise, six UNDP Offices from the two regions developed data innovation proof-of-concept projects with governmental and civil society partners, to address urgent local challenges and gain hands-on experience in data innovation.

      UN Global Pulse provided technical guidance, coaching and tools to the project managers for the duration of the exercise, and the cohort shared advice and challenges at in-person workshops. This guide is based on these experiences, and on the methodology created by Global Pulse to design and implement data innovation projects across the UN system.

      The joint exercise showed how alternative sources of data can and should play a role in pursuing development outcomes and, as such, hold great promise for ful lling the Sustainable Development Goals—both from the perspective of pursuing the outcomes as well as enabling (close to) real-time monitoring and evaluation.

  title: 'Toward Evidence-Based Open Governance by Curating and Exchanging Research:
    OGRX 2.0'
  author:

  type:
  - Announcement
  highlight: OGRX seeks to improve the visibility and accessibility of open governance
    research – across domains like open data, crowdsourcing and civic tech
  post: "The Open Governance Research Exchange (OGRX) is a platform that seeks to
    identify, collect and share curated insights on new ways of solving public problems.
    It was created last year by founding partners [the GovLab](http://ogrx.org/organizations/the-govlab.html),
    [World Bank Digital Engagement Evaluation Team](http://ogrx.org/organizations/world-bank-digital-engagement-evaluation-team.html)
    and [mySociety](http://ogrx.org/organizations/mysociety.html). Today, while more
    than 3000 representatives from more than 70 countries are gathering in Paris for
    the Open Government Partnership Summit, we are launching OGRX 2.0 with new features
    and functionalities to further help users identify the signal in the noise of
    research and evidence on more innovative means of governing.\n \n__What are the
    goals behind OGRX?__\n\nThe field of research on topics falling under the banner
    of open governance is rapidly growing and evolving. Identifying the most important
    findings remains challenging, however, and important work often resides behind
    paywalls. OGRX seeks to improve the visibility and accessibility of open governance
    research – across domains like open data, crowdsourcing and civic tech – through
    curation, a [submission form](http://ogrx.org/submit.html) for users to share
    important publications and a detailed taxonomy to help users browse and find the
    research that fits their needs.\n \n__What is new?__\n\nFirst, the new __OGRX
    Blog__ provides an outlet for more easily digestible and shareable insights from
    the open governance research community. OGRX currently features over 600 publications
    on governance innovation – but how to digest and identify insights? This space
    will provide summaries of important works, analyses of key trends in the field
    of research, and guest posts from researchers working at the leading edge of governance
    innovation across regions and domains. Check back often to stay on top of what’s
    new in open governance research.\n \nSecond, the new __OGRX Selected Readings__
    series offers curated reading lists from well-known experts in open governance.
    These Selected Readings will give readers a sense of how to jumpstart their knowledge
    by focusing on those publications that have been curated by those in the known
    about the topics at hand. Today we are launching this new series with the [Selected
    Readings on Civic Technology](http://ogrx.org/list/selected-readings-on-civic-technology.html),
    curated by mySociety’s head of research [Rebecca Rumbul](http://ogrx.org/authors/rebecca-rumbul.html);
    and the [Selected Readings on Policy Informatics](http://ogrx.org/list/selected-readings-on-policy-informatics.html),
    curated by [Erik Johnston](http://ogrx.org/by/author.html?filter=.f-erik-johnston)
    of the [MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Opening Governance](http://www.opening-governance.org/)
    and director of the Arizona State University Center for Policy Informatics. New
    Selected Readings will be posted each month, so check back often!\n \n__Help us
    develop this joint resource on Open Governance__\n\nThese new developments are
    only the beginning of our efforts to increase the utility of OGRX and work toward
    more evidence based open governance. Future efforts could include a forum for
    researchers to share insights and best practices and a project inventory to help
    researchers identify partners and avoid duplicative efforts. Watch this space
    and #OGRX to stay abreast of new developments.\n \nAnd if you are interested in
    becoming an OGRX partner, developing a Selected Readings list or penning a guest
    post for the OGRX blog, please contact Andrew Young, OGRX editor-in-chief at [andrew@thegovlab.org](mailto:andrew@thegovlab.org).
    We’d also love to hear your feedback on the platform and any ideas you might have
    about how to ensure that it is as useful to the community of open governance researchers,
    policymakers and practitioners as possible.\n\n\n"
