    warrior searching for a righteous cause. As the world fell, each of us in our
    own way was broken. \n\n> It was hard to know who was more crazy... me... or everyone
    else.\n\nI am the one that runs from both \n1. the living \n2. and the dead. \n\nHunted
    by *scavengers*, haunted by those I could not protect. So I exist in this wasteland,
    reduced to one instinct: __survive__."

    abstract: Smart cities are associated almost exclusively with modern technology
      and infrastructure. However, smart cities have the possibility to enhance the
      involvement and contribution of citizens to urban development. This work explores
      the role of governance as one of the factors influencing the participation of
      citizens in smart cities projects. Governance characteristics play a major role
      in explaining different typologies of citizen participation. Through a focus
      on Amsterdam Smart City program as a specific case study, this research examines
      the characteristics of governance that are present in the overall program and
      within a selected sample of projects, and how they relate to different typologies
      of citizen participation. The analysis and comprehension of governance characteristics
      plays a crucial role both for a better understanding and management of citizen
      participation, especially in complex settings where multiple actors are interacting.

  abstract: Billions of dollars have been spent on participatory development programs
    in the developing world. These programs give community members an active decision-making
    role. Given the emphasis on community involvement, one might expect that the effectiveness
    of this approach would depend on communities' pre-existing social capital stocks.
    Using data from a large randomised field experiment of Community-Led Total Sanitation
    in Indonesia, we find that villages with high initial social capital built toilets
    and reduced open defecation, resulting in substantial health benefits. In villages
    with low initial stocks of social capital, the approach was counterproductive
    – fewer toilets were built than in control communities and social capital suffered.
