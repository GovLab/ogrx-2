  abstract: Smart cities are associated almost exclusively with modern technology
    and infrastructure. However, smart cities have the possibility to enhance the
    involvement and contribution of citizens to urban development. This work explores
    the role of governance as one of the factors influencing the participation of
    citizens in smart cities projects. Governance characteristics play a major role
    in explaining different typologies of citizen participation. Through a focus on
    Amsterdam Smart City program as a specific case study, this research examines
    the characteristics of governance that are present in the overall program and
    within a selected sample of projects, and how they relate to different typologies
    of citizen participation. The analysis and comprehension of governance characteristics
    plays a crucial role both for a better understanding and management of citizen
    participation, especially in complex settings where multiple actors are interacting.

    warrior searching for a righteous cause. As the world fell, each of us in our
    own way was broken. \n\n> It was hard to know who was more crazy... me... or everyone
    else.\n\nI am the one that runs from both \n1. the living \n2. and the dead. \n\nHunted
    by *scavengers*, haunted by those I could not protect. So I exist in this wasteland,
    reduced to one instinct: __survive__."
