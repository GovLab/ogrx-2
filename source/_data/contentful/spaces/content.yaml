  abstract: Over the last century, state and local governments have been challenged
    to keep proactive, emergency planning efforts ahead of the after-the-disaster,
    response efforts. After moving from decentralized to centralized planning efforts,
    the most recent policy has returned to the philosophy that a decentralized planning
    approach is the most effective way to plan for a disaster. In fact, under the
    Obama administration, a policy of using the “whole community” approach to emergency
    planning has been adopted. This approach, however, creates an obvious problem
    for state and local government practitioners already under pressure for funding,
    time, and the continuous need for higher and broader expertise—the problem of
    how to actually incorporate the whole community into emergency planning efforts.
    This article suggests one such approach, crowdsourcing, as an option for local
    governments. The crowdsourcer-problem-crowd-platform-solution (CPCPS) model is
    suggested as an initial framework for practitioners seeking a practical application
    and basic comprehension. The model, discussion, and additional examples in this
    essay provide a skeletal framework for state and local governments wishing to
    reach the whole community while under the constraints of time, budget, and technical
    expertise.

  abstract: New, “big” data sources allow measurement of city characteristics and
    outcome variables higher frequencies and finer geographic scales than ever before.
    However, big data will not solve large urban social science questions on its own.
    Big data has the most value for the study of cities when it allows measurement
    of the previously opaque, or when it can be coupled with exogenous shocks to people
    or place. We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they
    can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google
    Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting
    that similar image data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured
    areas of the developing world. We then discuss how survey techniques can be improved
    to better measure willingness to pay for urban amenities. Finally, we explain
    how Internet data is being used to improve the quality of city services.

  abstract: 'Policy makers can use four different modes of governance: ‘hierarchy’,
    ‘markets’, ‘networks’ and ‘persuasion’. In this article, it is argued that ‘nudging’
    represents a distinct (fifth) mode of governance. The effectiveness of nudging
    as a means of bringing about lasting behaviour change is questioned and it is
    argued that evidence for its success ignores the facts that many successful nudges
    are not in fact nudges; that there are instances when nudges backfire; and that
    there may be ethical concerns associated with nudges. Instead, and in contrast
    to nudging, behaviour change is more likely to be enduring where it involves social
    identity change and norm internalisation. The article concludes by urging public
    policy scholars to engage with the social identity literature on ‘social influence’,
    and the idea that those promoting lasting behaviour change need to engage with
    people not as individual cognitive misers, but as members of groups whose norms
    they internalise and enact.'

  abstract: "Objective: The objective of openFDA is to facilitate access and use of
    big important Food and Drug Administration public datasets by developers, researchers,
    and the public through harmonization of data across disparate FDA datasets provided
    via application programming interfaces (APIs). \n\nMaterials and Methods: Using
    cutting-edge technologies deployed on FDA’s new public cloud computing infrastructure,
    openFDA provides open data for easier, faster (over 300 requests per second per
    process), and better access to FDA datasets; open source code and documentation
    shared on GitHub for open community contributions of examples, apps and ideas;
    and infrastructure that can be adopted for other public health big data challenges.\n\nResults:
    Since its launch on June 2, 2014, openFDA has developed four APIs for drug and
    device adverse events, recall information for all FDA-regulated products, and
    drug labeling. There have been more than 20 million API calls (more than half
    from outside the United States), 6000 registered users, 20,000 connected Internet
    Protocol addresses, and dozens of new software (mobile or web) apps developed.
    A case study dem- onstrates a use of openFDA data to understand an apparent association
    of a drug with an adverse event.\n\nConclusion: With easier and faster access
    to these datasets, consumers worldwide can learn more about FDA-regulated products."

  abstract: 'Crowdsourcing design has been applied in various areas of graphic design,
    software design, and product design. This paper draws on those experiences and
    research in diversity, creativity and motivation to present a process model for
    crowdsourcing experience design. Crowdsourcing experience design for volunteer
    online communities serves two purposes: to increase the motivation of participants
    by making them stakeholders in the success of the project, and to increase the
    creativity of the design by increasing the diversity of expertise beyond experts
    in experience design. Our process model for crowdsourcing design extends the meta-design
    architecture, where for online communities is designed to be iteratively re-designed
    by its users. We describe how our model has been deployed and adapted to a citizen
    science project where nature preserve visitors can participate in the design of
    a system called NatureNet. The major contribution of this paper is a model for
    crowdsourcing experience design and a case study of how we have deployed it for
    the design and development of NatureNet.'

  abstract: 'This short article argues that an adequate response to the implications
    for governance raised by ‘Big Data’ requires much more attention to agency and
    reflexivity than theories of ‘algorithmic power’ have so far allowed. It develops
    this through two contrasting examples: the sociological study of social actors
    used of analytics to meet their own social ends (for example, by community organisations)
    and the study of actors’ attempts to build an economy of information more open
    to civic intervention than the existing one (for example, in the environmental
    sphere). The article concludes with a consideration of the broader norms that
    might contextualise these empirical studies, and proposes that they can be understood
    in terms of the notion of voice, although the practical implementation of voice
    as a norm means that voice must sometimes be considered via the notion of transparency.'

  abstract: 'Arguably the most important decision at an arraignment is whether to
    release an offender until the date of his or her next scheduled court appearance.
    Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, threats to public safety can be a key factor
    in that decision. Implicitly, a forecast of “future dangerousness” is required.
    In this article, we consider in particular whether usefully accurate forecasts
    of domestic violence can be obtained. We apply machine learning to data on over
    28,000 arraignment cases from a major metropolitan area in which an offender faces
    domestic violence charges. One of three possible post-arraignment outcomes is
    forecasted within two years: (1) a domestic violence arrest associated with a
    physical injury, (2) a domestic violence arrest not associated with a physical
    injury, and (3) no arrests for domestic violence. We incorporate asymmetric costs
    for different kinds of forecasting errors so that very strong statistical evidence
    is required before an offender is forecasted to be a good risk. When an out-of-sample
    forecast of no post-arraignment domestic violence arrests within two years is
    made, it is correct about 90 percent of the time. Under current practice within
    the jurisdiction studied, approximately 20 percent of those released after an
    arraignment for domestic violence are arrested within two years for a new domestic
    violence offense. If magistrates used the methods we have developed and released
    only offenders forecasted not to be arrested for domestic violence within two
    years after an arraignment, as few as 10 percent might be arrested. The failure
    rate could be cut nearly in half. Over a typical 24-month period in the jurisdiction
    studied, well over 2,000 post-arraignment arrests for domestic violence perhaps
    could be averted.'

  abstract: |-
    The economic and social potential of open data is widely acknowledged. In particular, the business opportunities have received much attention. But for all the excitement, we still know very little about how and under what conditions open data really works.

    To broaden our understanding of the use and impact of open data, the GovLab has a variety of initiatives and studies underway. Today, we share publicly our findings on how Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are leveraging open data for a variety of purposes. Our paper “Open Data: A 21st Century Asset for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises” seeks to build a portrait of the lifecycle of open data—how it is collected, stored and used. It outlines some of the most important parameters of an open data business model for SMEs.

    The universe of SMEs we analyzed comprised those identified within the GovLab’s Open Data 500 project which contains data on how 500 US businesses are using open data in their day-to-day activities. It represents arguably the first systematic effort to really understand how open data can grow revenues, drive innovation, increase efficiency and create new jobs.

    The paper analyzes ten aspects of open data and establishes ten principles for its effective use by SMEs. Taken together, these offer a roadmap for any SME considering greater use or adoption of open data in its business.

    Among the key findings included in the paper:

    SMEs, which often lack access to data or sophisticated analytical tools to process large datasets, are likely to be one of the chief beneficiaries of open data.
    Government data is the main category of open data being used by SMEs. A number of SMEs are also using open scientific and shared corporate data.
    Open data is used primarily to serve the Business-to-Business (B2B) markets, followed by the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) markets. A number of the companies studied serve two or three market segments simultaneously.
    Open data is usually a free resource, but SMEs are monetizing their open-data-driven services to build viable businesses. The most common revenue models include subscription-based services, advertising, fees for products and services, freemium models, licensing fees, lead generation and philanthropic grants.
    The most significant challenges SMEs face in using open data include those concerning data quality and consistency, insufficient financial and human resources, and issues surrounding privacy.
    This is just a sampling of findings and observations. The paper includes a number of additional observations concerning business and revenue models, product development, customer acquisition, and other subjects of relevance to any company considering an open data strategy.

    Government conceptual model, which describes Open Government through data openness,
    transparency, participation and collaboration. Resulting in two measures, that
    is, one known as the e-government openness index (eGovOI) and the other Maturity,
    the benchmark indicates the progress of government over time, the efficiency of
    recognizing and implementing new concepts and the willingness of the government
    to recognize and embrace innovative ideas.

  abstract: 'Although a great many different crowdsourcing approaches are available
    to those seeking to accomplish individual or organizational tasks, little research
    attention has yet been given to characterizing how those approaches might be based
    on task characteristics. To that end, we conducted an extensive review of the
    crowdsourcing landscape, including a look at what types of taxonomies are currently
    available. Our review found that no taxonomy explored the multidimensional nature
    of task complexity. This paper develops a taxonomy whose specific intent is the
    classification of approaches in terms of the types of tasks for which they are
    best suited. To develop this task-based taxonomy, we followed an iterative approach
    that considered over 100 well-known examples of crowdsourcing. The taxonomy considers
    three dimensions of task complexity: (a) task structure – is the task well-defined,
    or does it require a more open-ended solution; (2) task interdependence – can
    the task be solved by an individual, or does it require a community of problem
    solvers; and (3) task commitment – what level of commitment is expected from crowd
    members? Based on this taxonomy, we identify seven categories of crowdsourcing
    and discuss prototypical examples of each approach. Furnished with such an understanding,
    one should be able to determine which crowdsourcing approach is most suitable
    for a particular task situation.'

  abstract: Over 2014, the Cornell University Legal Information Institute and the
    Australian National University worked with users of the Cornell LII site in a
    citizen science project to collect over 43,000 crowdsourced assessments of the
    readability of legal and other sentences. Readers (“citizen scientists”) on legislative
    pages of the LII site were asked to rate passages from the United States Code
    and the Code of Federal Regulations and other texts for readability and other
    characteristics. They were also asked to provide information about themselves
    as part of the audience that uses legislation online. The overall aim of the project
    was to develop empirical insights into characteristics of law that may make it
    easy or hard to read for the audience that use it. Also, the project aimed to
    assess machine learning for automatically predicting readability of legal sentences
    at sentence level. A major focus of this paper is to report results and insights
    from demographic data collected during the study. Understanding the audience which
    reads the law is directly relevant to readability - as the relevant question is
    readable by whom? Who are the citizens for whom “citizen access” might be enhanced?
    The paper also describes methods used to rank sentences by readability, using
    the data provided by citizen scientists. Finally, the paper reports initial tests
    on the viability of machine learning as a means of predicting readability in advance.
    The exploratory machine learning results reported here will be extended in further
    work reported in a future paper. The research provides insight into who uses legal
    rules and how they do so. We draw conclusions as to the current readability of
    law, as well as the spread of readability among legal rules. The research creates
    a dataset of legal rules labelled for readability by human judges. As far as we
    are aware, this research project is the largest ever study of readability of regulatory
    language and the first research which has applied crowdsourcing to such an investigation.

    One problem with manipulation, thus understood, is that it fails to respect people’s
    autonomy and is an affront to their dignity. Another problem is that if they are
    products of manipulation, people’s choices might fail to promote their own welfare,
    and might instead promote the welfare of the manipulator. To that extent, the
    central objection to manipulation is rooted in a version of Mill’s Harm Principle:
    People know what is in their best interests and should have a (manipulation-free)
    opportunity to make that decision. On welfarist grounds, the norm against manipulation
    can be seen as a kind of heuristic, one that generally works well, but that can
    also lead to serious errors, at least when the manipulator is both informed and
    genuinely interested in the welfare of the chooser. \n\nFor the legal system,
    a pervasive puzzle is why manipulation is rarely policed. The simplest answer
    is that manipulation has so many shades, and in a social order that values free
    markets and is committed to freedom of expression, it is exceptionally difficult
    to regulate manipulation as such. But as the manipulator’s motives become more
    self-interested or venal, and as efforts to bypass people’s deliberative capacities
    becomes more successful, the ethical objections to manipulation become very forceful,
    and the argument for a legal response is fortified. The analysis of manipulation
    bears on emerging first amendment issues raised by compelled speech, especially
    in the context of graphic health warnings. Importantly, it can also help orient
    the regulation of financial products, where manipulation of consumer choices is
    an evident but rarely explicit concern."

    Background: Existing influenza surveillance in the United States is focused on the collection of data from sentinel physicians and hospitals; however, the compilation and distribution of reports are usually delayed by up to 2 weeks. With the popularity of social media growing, the Internet is a source for syndromic surveillance due to the availability of large amounts of data. In this study, tweets, or posts of 140 characters or less, from the website Twitter were collected and analyzed for their potential as surveillance for seasonal influenza.
    Objective: There were three aims: (1) to improve the correlation of tweets to sentinel-provided influenza-like illness (ILI) rates by city through filtering and a machine-learning classifier, (2) to observe correlations of tweets for emergency department ILI rates by city, and (3) to explore correlations for tweets to laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego.
    Methods: Tweets containing the keyword “flu” were collected within a 17-mile radius from 11 US cities selected for population and availability of ILI data. At the end of the collection period, 159,802 tweets were used for correlation analyses with sentinel-provided ILI and emergency department ILI rates as reported by the corresponding city or county health department. Two separate methods were used to observe correlations between tweets and ILI rates: filtering the tweets by type (non-retweets, retweets, tweets with a URL, tweets without a URL), and the use of a machine-learning classifier that determined whether a tweet was “valid”, or from a user who was likely ill with the flu.
    Results: Correlations varied by city but general trends were observed. Non-retweets and tweets without a URL had higher and more significant (P<.05) correlations than retweets and tweets with a URL. Correlations of tweets to emergency department ILI rates were higher than the correlations observed for sentinel-provided ILI for most of the cities. The machine-learning classifier yielded the highest correlations for many of the cities when using the sentinel-provided or emergency department ILI as well as the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego. High correlation values (r=.93) with significance at P<.001 were observed for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for most categories and tweets determined to be valid by the classifier.
    Conclusions: Compared to tweet analyses in the previous influenza season, this study demonstrated increased accuracy in using Twitter as a supplementary surveillance tool for influenza as better filtering and classification methods yielded higher correlations for the 2013-2014 influenza season than those found for tweets in the previous influenza season, where emergency department ILI rates were better correlated to tweets than sentinel-provided ILI rates. Further investigations in the field would require expansion with regard to the location that the tweets are collected from, as well as the availability of more ILI data.

  abstract: 'Open government initiatives in the U.S. government focus on three main
    aspects: transparency, participation, and collaboration. Especially the collaboration
    mandate is relatively unexplored in the literature. In practice, government organizations
    recognize the need to include external problem solvers into their internal innovation
    creation processes. This is partly derived from a sense of urgency to improve
    the efficiency and quality of government service delivery. Another formal driver
    is the America Competes Act that instructs agencies to search for opportunities
    to meaningfully promote excellence in technology, education, and science. Government
    agencies are responding to these requirements by using open innovation (OI) approaches
    to invite citizens to crowdsource and peer produce solutions to public management
    problems. These distributed innovation processes occur at all levels of the U.S.
    government and it is important to understand what design elements are used to
    create innovative public management ideas. This article systematically reviews
    existing government crowdsourcing and peer production initiatives and shows that
    after agencies have defined their public management problem, they go through four
    different phases of the OI process: (1) idea generation through crowdsourcing,
    (2) incubation of submitted ideas with peer voting and collaborative improvements
    of favorite solutions, (3) validation with a proof of concept of implementation
    possibilities, and (4) reveal of the selected solution and the (internal) implementation
    of the winning idea. Participation and engagement are incentivized both with monetary
    and nonmonetary rewards, which lead to tangible solutions as well as intangible
    innovation outcomes, such as increased public awareness.'

  abstract: Open Data (OD) programs have become popular. OD proponents argue that
    OD  programs are necessary to reinvigorate participatory democracy and active
    citizenship. However, the debate between proponents and critics of these programs
    relies on anecdotal data. The paper describes a methodological innovation (dubbed
    “The Public Sector Information Exchange (PSIE)”) to automatically capture, process,
    store, and analyze metadata information about the Open Data (OD) information assets  published
    by government agencies at any level of government (e.g., federal, national, regional,
    municipal) worldwide. The analysis of the initial PSIE data (currently only about
    some datasets published by U.S. federal agencies) supports the argument that OD
    programs have become the playground of a small number of agencies and that many
    OD information assets are either incomprehensible or impossible to find. The concluding
    section of the paper discusses how to incentivize agencies to improve cooperation
    with OD programs.

  abstract: 'Over the last decade, there have been significant changes in data sharing
    policies and in the data sharing environment faced by life science researchers.
    Using data from a 2013 survey of over 1600 life science researchers, we analyze
    the effects of sharing policies of funding agencies and journals. We also examine
    the effects of new sharing infrastructure and tools (i.e., third party repositories
    and online supplements). We find that recently enacted data sharing policies and
    new sharing infrastructure and tools have had a sizable effect on encouraging
    data sharing. In particular, third party repositories and online supplements as
    well as data sharing requirements of funding agencies, particularly the NIH and
    the National Human Genome Research Institute, were perceived by scientists to
    have had a large effect on facilitating data sharing. In addition, we found a
    high degree of compliance with these new policies, although noncompliance resulted
    in few formal or informal sanctions. Despite the overall effectiveness of data
    sharing policies, some significant gaps remain: about one third of grant reviewers
    placed no weight on data sharing plans in their reviews, and a similar percentage
    ignored the requirements of material transfer agreements. These patterns suggest
    that although most of these new policies have been effective, there is still room
    for policy improvement.'

    Background: Investigation into personal health has become focused on conditions at an increasingly local level, while response rates have declined and complicated the process of collecting data at an individual level. Simultaneously, social media data have exploded in availability and have been shown to correlate with the prevalence of certain health conditions.

    Objective: Facebook likes may be a source of digital data that can complement traditional public health surveillance systems and provide data at a local level. We explored the use of Facebook likes as potential predictors of health outcomes and their behavioral determinants.

    Methods: We performed principal components and regression analyses to examine the predictive qualities of Facebook likes with regard to mortality, diseases, and lifestyle behaviors in 214 counties across the United States and 61 of 67 counties in Florida. These results were compared with those obtainable from a demographic model. Health data were obtained from both the 2010 and 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and mortality data were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System.
    Results: Facebook likes added significant value in predicting most examined health outcomes and behaviors even when controlling for age, race, and socioeconomic status, with model fit improvements (adjusted R2) of an average of 58% across models for 13 different health-related metrics over basic sociodemographic models. Small area data were not available in sufficient abundance to test the accuracy of the model in estimating health conditions in less populated markets, but initial analysis using data from Florida showed a strong model fit for obesity data (adjusted R2=.77).

    Conclusions: Facebook likes provide estimates for examined health outcomes and health behaviors that are comparable to those obtained from the BRFSS. Online sources may provide more reliable, timely, and cost-effective county-level data than that obtainable from traditional public health surveillance systems as well as serve as an adjunct to those systems.

  abstract: Could social media data aid in disaster response and damage assessment?
    Countries face both an increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters
    due to climate change. And during such events, citizens are turning to social
    media platforms for disaster-related communication and information. Social media
    improves situational awareness, facilitates dissemination of emergency information,
    enables early warning systems, and helps coordinate relief efforts. Additionally,
    spatiotemporal distribution of disaster-related messages helps with real-time
    monitoring and assessment of the disaster itself. Here we present a multiscale
    analysis of Twitter activity before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. We examine
    the online response of 50 metropolitan areas of the United States and find a strong
    relationship between proximity to Sandy’s path and hurricanerelated social media
    activity. We show that real and perceived threats – together with the physical
    disaster effects – are directly observable through the intensity and composition
    of Twitter’s message stream. We demonstrate that per-capita Twitter activity strongly
    correlates with the per-capita economic damage inflicted by the hurricane. Our
    findings suggest that massive online social networks can be used for rapid assessment
    (“nowcasting”) of damage caused by a large-scale disaster.

  abstract: 'Crowdsourcing is an emerging technology where innovation and production
    are sourced out to the public through an open call. At the center of crowdsourcing
    is a resource allocation problem: there is an abundance of workers but a scarcity
    of high skills, and an easy task assigned to a high-skill worker is a waste of
    resources. This problem is complicated by the fact that the exact difficulties
    of innovation tasks may not be known in advance, so tasks that require high-skill
    labor cannot be identified and allocated ahead of time. We show that the solution
    to this problem takes the form of a skill hierarchy, where tasks are first attempted
    by low-skill labor, and high skill workers only engage with a task if less skilled
    workers are unable to finish it. This hierarchy can be constructed and implemented
    in a decentralized manner even though neither the difficulties of the tasks nor
    the skills of the candidate workers are known. We provide a dynamic pricing mechanism
    that achieves this implementation by inducing workers to self-select into different
    layers. The mechanism is simple: each time a task is attempted and not finished,
    its price (reward upon completion) goes up.'

  abstract: Perfect anonymization of data sets has failed. But the process of protecting
    data subjects in shared information remains integral to privacy practice and policy.
    While the deidentification debate has been vigorous and productive, there is no
    clear direction for policy. As a result, the law has been slow to adapt a holistic
    approach to protecting data subjects when data sets are released to others. Currently,
    the law is focused on whether an individual can be identified within a given set.
    We argue that the better locus of data release policy is on the process of minimizing
    the risk of reidentification and sensitive attribute disclosure. Process-based
    data release policy, which resembles the law of data security, will help us move
    past the limitations of focusing on whether data sets have been “anonymized.”
    It draws upon different tactics to protect the privacy of data subjects, including
    accurate deidentification rhetoric, contracts prohibiting reidentification and
    sensitive attribute disclosure, data enclaves, and query-based strategies to match
    required protections with the level of risk. By focusing on process, data release
    policy can better balance privacy and utility where nearly all data exchanges
    carry some risk.

    This paper considers how crowdsourcing applications and crowdsourced data are currently being applied, as well as potential new uses for active transportation research and planning efforts of various types.

    The objectives of this white paper are to review existing crowdsourced bicycle and pedestrian data resources and crowdsourcing tools; discuss potential planning implementations of crowdsourced data for a sample of bicycle and pedestrian project types; and provide examples of how crowdsourcing is currently being used to inform decision-making. Potential issues related to crowdsourced data are also considered (e.g., quality, privacy concerns, participation rates, bias). The research presented here highlights a decreasing skepticism over the quality of volunteered, user-generated data provided by amateurs (as opposed to professionals) in light of a desire to open the lines of communication between the planning world and those affected by planning decisions, directly addressing (rather than being discouraged by) data limitations. The initiatives surrounding progressive data collection, management, and analysis are further reflected in the numerous conferences, meetups, and other events fostering collaboration between planners, developers, data scientists and others interested in applying critical thought and innovation in planning.

    While this paper reviews existing crowdsourcing techniques and their current applications in planning, the pace of technological change and rate of adoption in planning indicates that planners will continue to develop and apply innovative approaches like crowdsourcing in response to continually changing community needs. This paper focuses on examples of current uses of crowdsourced data, crowdsourcing data suggestions, and data considerations.

  abstract: This paper explores the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing incident
    and how members of the general public, through the online community Reddit, attempted
    to provide assistance to law enforcement through conducting their own parallel
    investigations. As we document through an analysis of user posts, Reddit members
    shared information about the investigation, searched for information that would
    identify the perpetrators and, in some cases, drew on their own expert knowledge
    to uncover clues concerning key aspects of the attack. Although it is the case
    that the Reddit cyber-sleuths’ did not ultimately solve this case, or provide
    significant assistance to the police investigation, their actions suggest the
    potential role the public could play within security networks.

  abstract: |+
    Over the last three years, the Boston Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, the innovative, collaborative ethos within City Hall fostered by Mayor Menino and his current chief of staff, Mitchell Weiss, and Boston's launch of a CRM system and its associated Citizens Connect smartphone app have all attracted substantial media attention. In particular, the City of Boston's strategy to put citizen engagement and participation at the center of its efforts, implemented by Chris Osgood and Nigel Jacob as co-chairs of the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, has drawn attention to the potential power of collaboration and technology to transform citizens' connections to their government and to each other. Several global developments have combined to make Boston's collaborative efforts interesting: First, city managers around the world confront shrinking budgets and diminishing trust in the role of government; second, civic entrepreneurs and technology innovators are pressuring local governments to adopt new forms of engagement with citizens; and third, new digital tools are emerging that can help make city services both more visible and more effective. Boston's experience in pursuing partnerships that facilitate opportunities for engaging citizens may provide scalable (and disruptive) lessons for other cities.

    During the summer of 2013, in anticipation of Mayor Menino's retirement in January 2014, Prof. Susan Crawford and Project Assistant Dana Walters carried out a case study examining the ongoing evolution of the Boston Mayor's Hotline into a platform for civic engagement. We chose this CRM focus because the initial development of the system provides a concrete example of how leaders in government can connect to local partners and citizens. In the course of this research, we interviewed 21 city employees and several of their partners outside government, and gathered data about the use of the system. (Exhibit A is a list of interviewees.)

    We found a traditional technology story — selection and integration of CRM software, initial performance management using that software, development of ancillary channels of communication, initial patterns of adoption and use — that reflects the commitment of Mayor Menino to personalized constituent service. We also found that that commitment, his long tenure, and the particular personalities of the people on the New Urban Mechanics team make this both a cultural story as well as a technology story. Here are the highlights: The combination of Mitchell Weiss's vision for citizen engagement, Nigel Jacob's expertise in software development and digital strategy, Chris Osgood's experience in navigating government bureaucracy, and Bill Oates's (CIO) private-sector experience has allowed this team to launch successful projects and build valuable partnerships that focus on citizen-centered innovation; Even without budgetary authority or staff, the innovation office within the Mayor's suite (the Office of New Urban Mechanics) has been able to nudge, encourage, and facilitate collaborations inside City Hall and across academic institutions, technologists, and other city governments that have been productive; As one example of the team's joint efforts and partnerships, both inside and outside City Hall, the launch of Boston's Lagan CRM system in October 2008 was followed by integration of the system into the operations of several constituent-facing service departments; The system has evolved over time to include, among other things, a mobile app for field workers in the Department of Public Works (City Worker), a smartphone app for citizens (Citizen Connect), reports that are useful for performance management, and several different channels through which citizens can interact with City Hall, while retaining its high-touch, personalized character; Although every CRM system case is assigned a case ID number, the CRM system as a whole does not automatically assign a unique identifier to citizens that would allow uniform tracking across different modes of contact (smartphone app, Web interface, phone call) or mapping of particular citizens to particular neighborhoods. Constituents who contact the system may voluntarily provide contact details (name, home address, email, and phone); Future versions of this system, and layering of CRM data over other City data (911, inspections, sensor data, social sentiment data, traffic data), could make possible much more extensive citizen collaboration, situation awareness, policy inputs, performance analysis, and co-creation of government services or policies. Although there are many channels for reporting into the CRM system — Citizens Connect, SMS, web chat, phone calls — all of the people reporting in are not connected to each other, and the lack of unique identifiers makes true "citizen relationship management" difficult. Customer satisfaction is also not measured by the system, as far as we can tell. Outbound calls, texting, and Twitter/social media sentiment mining might be useful tools for this assessment; Combining formal CRM requests with social sentiment information could provide useful guidance underpinning policy decisions and resource allocation. Connecting all of this information to job functions within City Hall would also clearly be productive. And if we believe that people in their communities know more about their communities than all the gifted people in City Hall, how do we enable them to help themselves solve some of their own problems? Boston City Hall has not been focused on predictive analytics or the public release of data; rather, the team's top priorities (in line with Mayor Menino's strategy) have been to improve service delivery and encourage citizen engagement; Mayor Menino's leadership style, strategic goals, and long tenure, together with the particular personalities of the members of the core team profiled in this study, have been essential to this narrative; The longterm effects on either the operation of City government or citizen engagement of the Office of New Urban Mechanics and the innovative, experimental ethos encouraged by that Office, Chief of Staff Mitchell Weiss, and CIO Bill Oates are unclear. Much will depend on the character and priorities of the new mayor.

  abstract: Non-profit organizations are actively using social media platforms as
    a way to deliver information to end users, yet little is known of the internal
    processes these organizations follow to implement this tool. We present a case
    study of one non-profit organization, Blue Star Families, Inc., that is actively
    engaged in advocacy and civic engagement. We offer a new model to explore non-profit
    organizations’ use of social media platforms by building on previous models and
    frameworks developed to explore the use of social media in the public, private,
    and non-profit sectors.

  abstract: Crisis mapping has emerged as a method of connecting and empowering citizens
    during emergencies. This article explores the hyperbole behind crisis mapping
    as it extends into more long-term or ‘chronic’ community development practices.
    We critically examined developer issues and participant (i.e. community organization)
    usage within the context of local communities. We repurposed the predominant crisis
    mapping platform Crowdmap for three cases of community development in Canadian
    anglophone and francophone. Our case studies show mixed results about the actual
    cost of deployment, the results of disintermediation, and local context with the
    mapping application. Lastly, we discuss the relationship of hype, temporality,
    and community development as expressed in our cases.

  abstract: Given the pace of discovery in medicine, accessing the literature to make
    informed decisions at the point of care has become increasingly difficult. Although
    the Internet creates unprecedented access to information, gaps in the medical
    literature and inefficient searches often leave healthcare providers' questions
    unanswered. Advances in social computation and human computer interactions offer
    a potential solution to this problem. We developed and piloted the mobile application
    DocCHIRP, which uses a system of point-to-multipoint push notifications designed
    to help providers problem solve by crowdsourcing from their peers. Over the 244-day
    pilot period, 85 registered users logged 1544 page views and sent 45 consult questions.
    The median initial first response from the crowd occurred within 19 minutes. Review
    of the transcripts revealed several dominant themes, including complex medical
    decision making and inquiries related to prescription medication use. Feedback
    from the post-trial survey identified potential hurdles related to medical crowdsourcing,
    including a reluctance to expose personal knowledge gaps and the potential risk
    for “distracted doctoring.” Users also suggested program modifications that could
    support future adoption, including changes to the mobile interface and mechanisms
    that could expand the crowd of participating healthcare providers.Journal of Hospital

  abstract: The widespread availability of high-quality Web-based content offers new
    potential for supporting teachers as designers of curricula and classroom activities.
    When coupled with a participatory Web culture and infrastructure, teachers can
    share their creations as well as leverage from the best that their peers have
    to offer to support a collective intelligence or crowdsourcing community, which
    we dubcrowdteaching. We applied a collective intelligence framework to characterize
    crowdteaching in the context of a Web-based tool for teachers called the Instructional
    Architect (IA). The IA enables teachers to find, create, and share instructional
    activities (called IA projects) for their students using online learning resources.
    These IA projects can further be viewed, copied, or adapted by other IA users.
    This study examines the usage activities of two samples of teachers, and also
    analyzes the characteristics of a subset of their IA projects. Analyses of teacher
    activities suggest that they are engaging in crowdteaching processes. Teachers,
    on average, chose to share over half of their IA projects, and copied some directly
    from other IA projects. Thus, these teachers can be seen as both contributors
    to and consumers of crowdteaching processes. In addition, IA users preferred to
    view IA projects rather than to completely copy them. Finally, correlational results
    based on an analysis of the characteristics of IA projects suggest that several
    easily computed metrics (number of views, number of copies, and number of words
    in IA projects) can act as an indirect proxy of instructionally relevant indicators
    of the content of IA projects.

  abstract: |-
    Innovation is a key driver in organizational sustainability, and yes, openness and transparency are a recipe for innovation. But, according to Tapscott and Williams, “when it comes to innovation, competitive advantage and organizational success, ‘openness’ is rarely the first word one would use to describe companies and other societal organizations like government agencies or medical institutions. For many, words like ‘insular,’ ‘bureaucratic,’ ‘hierarchical,’ ‘secretive’ and ‘closed’ come to mind instead.”1 And yet a few months ago, The Tesla Model S just became the world's first open-source car. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motor Vehicles, shared all the patents on Tesla's electric car technology, allowing anyone — including competitors — to use them without fear of litigation. Elon wrote in his post “Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology.”2
    In the public sector, terms such as open government, citizen sourcing, and wiki government are also akin to the notion of open innovation and transparency. As Hilgers and Ihl report, “a good example of this approach is the success of the Future Melbourne program, a Wiki and blog-based approach to shaping the future urban landscape of Australia’s second largest city. The program allowed citizens to directly edit and comment on the plans for the future development of the city. It attracted more than 30,000 individuals, who submitted hundreds of comments and suggestions (futuremelbourne.com.au). Basically, problems concerning design and creativity, future strategy and local culture, and even questions of management and service innovation can be broadcasted on such web-platforms.”3 The authors suggest that there are three dimensions to applying the concept of open innovation to the public sector: citizen ideation and innovation (tapping knowledge and creativity), collaborative administration (user generated new tasks and processes), and collaborative democracy (improve public participation in the policy process).

  abstract: Given that the Obama administration still relies on many strategies we
    would think of as sitting on the side of secrecy, it seems that the only lasting
    transparency legacy of the Obama administration will be data-driven or e-transparency
    as exemplified by the web interface ‘data.gov’. As the data-driven transparency
    model is exported and assumes an ascendant position around the globe, it is imperative
    that we ask what kind of publics, subjects, and indeed, politics it will produce.
    Open government data is not just a matter concerning accountability but is seen
    as a necessary component of the new ‘data economy’. To participate and benefit
    from this info-capitalist-democracy, the data subject is called upon to be both
    auditor and entrepreneur. This article explores the implications of responsibilization,
    outsourcing, and commodification on the contract of representational democracy
    and asks if there are other forms of transparency that might better resist neoliberal
    formations and re-politicize the public sphere.

    Data from clinical trials, including participant-level data, are being shared by sponsors and investigators more widely than ever before. Some sponsors have voluntarily offered data to researchers, some journals now require authors to agree to share the data underlying the studies they publish, the Office of Science and Technology Policy has directed federal agencies to expand public access to data from federally funded projects, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have proposed the expansion of access to data submitted in regulatory applications. Sharing participant-level data may bring exciting benefits for scientific research and public health but may also have unintended consequences. Thus, expanded data sharing must be pursued thoughtfully.
    We provide a suggested framework for broad sharing of participant-level data from clinical trials and related technical documents. After reviewing current data-sharing initiatives, potential benefits and risks, and legal and regulatory implications, we propose potential governing principles and key features for a system of expanded access to participant-level data and evaluate several governance structures.

  abstract: In an increasingly connected and networked world, the National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration (NASA) recognizes the value of the public as a strategic
    partner in addressing some of our most pressing challenges. The agency is working
    to more effectively harness the expertise, ingenuity, and creativity of individual
    members of the public by enabling, accelerating, and scaling the use of open innovation
    approaches including prizes, challenges, and crowdsourcing. As NASA's use of open
    innovation tools to solve a variety of types of problems and advance of number
    of outcomes continues to grow, challenge design is also becoming more sophisticated
    as our expertise and capacity (personnel, platforms, and partners) grows and develops.
    NASA has recently pivoted from talking about the benefits of challenge-driven
    approaches, to the outcomes these types of activities yield. Challenge design
    should be informed by desired outcomes that align with NASA's mission. This paper
    provides several case studies of NASA open innovation activities and maps the
    outcomes of those activities to a successful set of outcomes that challenges can
    help drive alongside traditional tools such as contracts, grants and partnerships.

  post: "My name is __Max__. My world is *fire and blood*. Once, I was a cop. A road
    warrior searching for a righteous cause. As the world fell, each of us in our
    own way was broken. \n\n> It was hard to know who was more crazy... me... or everyone
    else.\n\nI am the one that runs from both \n1. the living \n2. and the dead. \n\nHunted
    by *scavengers*, haunted by those I could not protect. So I exist in this wasteland,
    reduced to one instinct: __survive__."
