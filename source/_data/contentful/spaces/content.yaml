  abstract: 'The concept of open government, having been promoted widely in the past
    5 years, has promised a broader notion than e-government, as supposed to fundamentally
    transform governments to become more open and participative and collaborative.
    Unfortunately, this has not significantly enhanced a set of fundamental problems
    regarding e-government. One of the problems is that the underlying democratic
    ideology is rarely clearly expressed. In this paper, we have therefore constructed
    a framework for the analysis of open government from a democratic perspective,
    to explore the research foundation of open government and the types of research
    missing. We have looked closely at the notion of democracy in peer-reviewed journals
    on open government from 2009 to 2013, focusing on discussions of some fundamental
    issues regarding democracy and the type of solutions suggested. We have found
    that despite seemingly good intentions and an extensive rhetoric, there is still
    an apparent lack of adequate tools in which public deliberation and representation
    are addressed in any meaningful sense. There are two main important observations
    herein: (i) the rhetoric in the dominant discourse supports the concept of open
    government formulated by the Obama administration as transparency, participation,
    and collaboration, but in practice, the focus is predominantly on transparency
    and information exchange, while ignoring fundamental democratic issues regarding
    participation and collaboration, and (ii) the concept of the public is inadequately
    considered as a homogenous entity rather than a diversified group with different
    interests, preferences, and abilities.'

  abstract: |-
    With cities growing rapidly throughout much of the developing world, the global development community increasingly recognizes the need to build the capacities of local leaders to analyze and apply data to improve urban policymaking and service delivery. Civil society leaders, development advocates, and local governments are calling for an “urban data revolution” to accompany the new UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a revolution that would provide city leaders new tools and resources for data-driven governance. The need for improved data and analytic capacity in rapidly growing cities is clear, as is the exponential increase in the volume and types of data available for policymaking. However, the institutional arrangements that will allow city leaders to use data effectively remain incompletely theorized and poorly articulated.

    This paper begins to fill that gap with a political economy framework that introduces three new concepts: permission, incentive, and institutionalization. We argue that without addressing the permission constraints and competing incentives that local government officials face in using data, investments in improved data collection at the local level will fail to achieve smarter urban policies. Granting permission and aligning incentives are also necessary to institutionalize data-driven governance at the local level and create a culture of evidence-based decisionmaking that outlives individual political administrations. Lastly, we suggest how the SDGs could support a truly transformative urban data revolution in which city leaders are empowered and incentivized to use data to drive decisionmaking for sustainable development.

    the digital age is not between capitalism and communism or democracy and autocracy

  abstract: Crowdsourcing has become a quick and efficient way to solve a wide variety
    of problems - technical solutions, social and economic actions, fundraising and
    troubleshooting of numerous issues that affect both the private and the public

    that previously had to be handled by a limited circle of professionals. This paper
    outlines several examples of how a Department of Defense project headquartered
    at the National Defense University is using crowdsourcing for solutions to disaster
    response problems.

  abstract: It is well known that the layout and configuration of urban space plugs
    directly into our sense of community wellbeing. The twentieth-century city planner
    Kevin Lynch showed that a city's dwellers create their own personal 'mental maps'
    of the city based on features such as the routes they use and the areas they visit.
    Maps that are easy to remember and navigate bring comfort and ultimately contribute
    to people's wellbeing. Unfortunately, traditional social science experiments (including
    those used to capture mental maps) take time, are costly, and cannot be conducted
    at city scale. This paper describes how, starting in mid-2012, a team of researchers
    from a variety of disciplines set about tackling these issues. They were able
    to translate a few traditional experiments into 1-minute 'web games with a purpose'.
    This article describes those games, the main insights they offer, their theoretical
    implications for urban planning, and their practical implications for improvements
    in navigation technologies.

  abstract: The research deals primarily with the research question – How can engagement
    of civil society organizations with open government data be instigated or enhanced?
    To answer the question, an action research was conducted in two provinces in the
    Philippines where civil society organizations in Negros Oriental province were
    trained, and in the Bohol province were mentored on accessing and using open government
    data. The research showed that for capacity building programs to be effective,
    they should be relevant to the condition of the CSOs and the individual needs
    of learners; conducted with a long-term view of ensuring use and actual impact
    not only on the organization but also on the constituencies that they serve; focused
    on higher-order results like changes in practices and behavior of organizations
    and their staff members or the actual production of outputs that benefits citizens
    and communities; and targeted to achieve whole-of-organization awareness, appreciation,
    and motivation to use data. This paper asserts that short-term, sporadic, one-time
    buzz trainings, or off-the-shelf training programs, currently the prevailing modes
    of capacity building delivery, will not yield to actual data use that will show
    the economic, political, and social power of open data.

  abstract: 'This paper develops and tests a theoretical model, which assesses the
    commitment of cities to the concept of open government data (OGD), according to
    three levels. Level 1, ‘Way of life,’ reflects a high commitment to OGD; Level
    2, ‘On the Fence,’ represents either a low or erratic commitment to OGD; Level
    3, ‘Lip Service,’ refers to either scarce or no commitment to OGD. These levels
    draw on four key dimensions: 1) Rhythm; 2) Span of Issues; 3) Disclosure; and
    4) Feedback. We empirically examine this theoretical framework using longitudinal
    mixed-method analysis of the OGD behavior of 16 US cities for a period of four
    years, using a large novel corpus of municipal OGD metadata, as well as primary
    qualitative and secondary quantitative indicators. This methodology allows us
    to represent, for the first time, the evolving OGD commitment — or “OGD heart
    beat” — of cities.'

  abstract: Computing power and analytical methods allow us to create, collate, and
    analyze more data than ever before. When datasets are unusually large in volume,
    velocity, and variety, they are referred to as “big data.” Some observers have
    suggested that in order to cope with big data (a) organizational structures will
    need to change and (b) the processes used to design organizations will be different.
    In this article, we differentiate big data from relatively slow-moving, linked
    people data. We argue that big data will change organizational structures as organizations
    pursue the opportunities presented by big data. The processes by which organizations
    are designed, however, will be relatively unaffected by big data. Instead, organization
    design processes will be more affected by the complex links found in people data.

  abstract: For the past three years, the Centre for Information Policy Leadership
    at Hunton & Williams LLP has served as secretariat for the Accountability Project.
    The Accountability Project is the work of an international group of experts that
    includes representatives of privacy enforcement agencies from Europe, North America,
    and the Asia-Pacific region; civil society; academia and business. Its mission
    is to consider how an accountabilitybased system of data protection might be designed.
    The inquiry originally focused on cross-border data transfers, but expanded to
    address how to apply accountability to improve compliance with privacy requirements
    and to enable more flexible information management. This paper reflects the discussions
    and findings of the Accountability Project, and is intended solely to serve as
    a report of the work of that initiative

    is developed by highlighting how it is different from its main “competitor”—collaborative
    governance, and from other two popular concepts—open government and e-democracy.
    The other sections are designed to answer to public managers regarding why and
    what to adopt from this governance model for public sector services.

  abstract: 'This paper examines the impact of crowdsourcing on a policymaking process
    by using a novel data analytics tool called Civic CrowdAnalytics, applying Natural
    Language Processing (NLP) methods such as concept extraction, word association
    and sentiment analysis. By drawing on data from a crowdsourced urban planning
    process in the City of Palo Alto in California, we examine the influence of civic
    input on the city’s Comprehensive City Plan update. The findings show that the
    impact of citizens’ voices depends on the volume and the tone of their demands.
    A higher demand with a stronger tone results in more policy changes. We also found
    an interesting and unexpected result: the city government in Palo Alto mirrors
    more or less the online crowd’s voice while citizen representatives rather filter
    than mirror the crowd’s will. While NLP methods show promise in making the analysis
    of the crowdsourced input more efficient, there are several issues. The accuracy
    rates should be improved. Furthermore, there is still considerable amount of human
    work in training the algorithm.'

  abstract: |-
    Data from clinical trials, including participant-level data, are being shared by sponsors and investigators more widely than ever before. Some sponsors have voluntarily offered data to researchers, some journals now require authors to agree to share the data underlying the studies they publish, the Office of Science and Technology Policy has directed federal agencies to expand public access to data from federally funded projects, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have proposed the expansion of access to data submitted in regulatory applications. Sharing participant-level data may bring exciting benefits for scientific research and public health but may also have unintended consequences. Thus, expanded data sharing must be pursued thoughtfully.
    We provide a suggested framework for broad sharing of participant-level data from clinical trials and related technical documents. After reviewing current data-sharing initiatives, potential benefits and risks, and legal and regulatory implications, we propose potential governing principles and key features for a system of expanded access to participant-level data and evaluate several governance structures.

  abstract: Reflecting on the governance of smart cities, the state-of-the-art this
    paper advances offers a critique of recent city ranking and future Internet accounts
    of their development. Armed with these critical insights, it goes on to explain
    smart cities in terms of the social networks, cultural attributes and environmental
    capacities, vis-a-vis, vital ecologies of the intellectual capital, wealth creation
    and standards of participatory governance regulating their development. The Triple
    Helix model which the paper advances to explain these performances in turn suggests
    that cities are smart when the ICTs of future Internet developments successfully
    embed the networks society needs for them to not only generate intellectual capital,
    or create wealth, but also cultivate the environmental capacity, ecology and vitality
    of those spaces which the direct democracy of their participatory governance open
    up, add value to and construct.

  abstract: This is an exploratory research designed to contribute to increase knowl-
    edge about open data in Brazil. The research is divided into two stages, namely,
    a quantitative and a qualitative stage. The quantitative research was designed
    to measure the scope of rules imposed by new Brazilian legislation for budget
    transparency in open data format. To this end, 27 websites of capitals6, one site
    of the federal government and one site of the Senate were analyzed. In addi- tion,
    a ranking of these 29 national and subnational entities was developed. The qualitative
    research was designed to complement the data collected during the quantitative
    survey with the aim of capturing possible impacts of open data on expanding human
    rights in Brazil based on the perception of more qualified users on open data
    access and analysis, the so-called "intermediaries."

    We are living in the age of cities. It is an urgent time, and an uncertain one. Never before have human beings built so much with such haste. Yet we understand so little about how our urban world grows — and sometimes — declines.

    To meet this challenge, the world’s universities have set out to plug this knowledge gap, and establish a new science of cities. This report is an initial attempt to understand the collective scope and impact of this movement. What does this new science seek to achieve? Who are its practitioners? What questions are they pursuing? What methods do they use? What are they learning? How might their discoveries shape our shared urban destiny?

  abstract: "Public sector innovation is an important issue in the agenda of policymakers
    and academics but there is a need for a change of perspective, one that promotes
    a more open model of innovating, which takes advantage of the possibilities offered
    by collaboration between citizens, entrepreneurs and civil society as well as
    of new emerging technologies. Living labs are environments that can support public
    open innovation processes.\n \n This article makes a practical contribution to
    understand the role of living labs as intermediaries of public open innovation.
    The analysis focuses on the dynamics of these innovation intermediaries, their
    outcomes, and their main challenges. In particular, it adopts a qualitative approach
    (fourteen semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted) in order
    to analyze two living labs: Citilab in the city of Cornellà and the network of
    fab athenaeums (public fab labs) in the city of Barcelona, both in Spain. After
    a thorough analysis of the attributes of these living labs, the article concludes
    that 1) living labs provide the opportunity for public agencies to meet with private
    sector organizations and thus function as innovation intermediaries, 2) implementing
    an open innovation perspective is considered more important than obtaining specific
    innovation results, and 3) scalability and sustainability are the main problems
    living labs encounter as open innovation intermediaries."

    Most organizations spend much of their effort on the start of the value creation process: namely, creating a strategy, developing new products or services, and analyzing the market. They pay a lot less attention to the end: the crucial “last mile” where consumers come to their website, store, or sales representatives and make a choice.

    In The Last Mile, Dilip Soman shows how to use insights from behavioral science in order to close that gap. Beginning with an introduction to the last mile problem and the concept of choice architecture, the book takes a deep dive into the psychology of choice, money, and time. It explains how to construct behavioral experiments and understand the data on preferences that they provide. Finally, it provides a range of practical tools with which to overcome common last mile difficulties.

  abstract: |-
    "Organizations are highly interested in integrative open innovation practices in their structure, as open innovation can bring a flood of creative contributions and problem solving from the public. However, there are significant challenges in successful adoption. One reason for this difficulty stems from conflicting organizational structures; open innovation practices are primarily online, fluid, rapid, iterative, and often temporary, whereas the command and control hierarchical structure of organizations are intended to be stable and to complete sustained services. Another source of this difficulty for administrators who are designing and managing open innovation efforts for the first time. Most administrators in organizations rarely have extensive technological or socio-technical design background or training. Therefore, an entire new skill set is being developed on to use participatory platforms. Even if the design and tech know-how is part of an administrator's toolkit, they may not know how to effectively align the goals, language, and evaluation metrics for successful implementation of participatory efforts. More often than not, administrators are attempting to run an open innovation effort in addition to their other, primary duties. Finally, even though open innovation tools like participatory platforms have existed for several years, there is high fragmentation and silos of working knowledge, meaning that many administrators continue to experiment in de facto isolation.

    This paper presents a case study of a public university that has made a purposeful effort to integrate open innovation values and practices into its organizational mission and work. To best understand the process of open innovation adoption and use, we interviewed administrative intermediaries who are primarily responsible for the design, management, and evaluation of open innovation platforms and programs. We explored intermediary administrators' experiences with open innovation adoption using organizational learning theory. We specifically asked questions along dimensions of design and management values, teamwork, and organizational innovation culture. We used theoretical pattern matching to explore how the experiences of interview respondents aligned with theoretical propositions of organizational learning. Our analysis provides detailed insights one best practices, challenges, and lessons learned in the design and management of participatory platforms within the organization. This study has four key findings to contribute to the management of open innovation practices in organizations. First, the best team and approaches cannot thrive within the right culture. Second, developing culture takes time and consistent and persistent work from administrators throughout the organization. Third, three types of hybridity were identified by intermediaries in the execution of their innovation effort. These include unintentional, segmented, and fluid hybridity arrangements. Fourth, administrative intermediaries can identify what is likely to lead to successful or unsuccessful implementation of open innovation platforms. These findings contribute a foundation about open innovation management that can assist other administrators in organizations seeking to integrate innovation and entrepreneurship practices into their core mission and daily activities.

  abstract: Can today's city govern well if its citizens lack modern technology? How
    important is access to computers for lowering unemployment? What infrastructure
    does a city have to build in order to attract new business? Michael A. Pagano
    curates engagement with such questions by public intellectuals, academics, policy
    analysts, and citizens. Each essay explores the impact and opportunities technology
    provides in government and citizenship, health care, workforce development, service
    delivery to citizens, and metropolitan growth. As the authors show, rapidly emerging
    technologies and access to such technologies shape the ways people and institutions
    interact in the public sphere and private marketplace. The direction of metropolitan
    growth and development, in turn, depends on access to appropriate technology scaled
    and informed by the individual, household, and community needs of the region.

  abstract: The thesis focuses on the emergence of e-democracy in the UK between 1999
    and 2013. It examines the part that policy actors have played in shaping the agenda.
    Emphasis is placed on how e-democracy is understood by those charged with developing
    initiatives and implementing government policy on e-democracy. Previous research
    on e-democracy has focused largely on the impact of Web technologies on political
    systems and/or on how, why and to what degree, citizens participate. Less attention
    is paid to what happens inside government, in how policy actors’ conceive public
    engagement in the policy process. Their perceptions and shared understandings
    are crucial to the commissioning, implementation, or deflection of participatory
    opportunities. This thesis is concerned with exploring how policy actors experience,
    interpret and negotiate e-democracy policy and practices and their perceptions
    of citizen involvement in the policy process. Competing discourses shape institutional
    expectations of e-democracy in the UK. The research examines how policy actors
    draw upon wider discourses such as the modernisation of government and the emphasis
    on transparency. It analyses understandings of technologies in government and
    the effects of relational interactions and linkages in policy and practice.

  abstract: Crowdsourcing offers unprecedented potential for solving tasks efficiently
    by tapping into the skills of large groups of people. A salient feature of crowdsourcing---its
    openness of entry---makes it vulnerable to malicious behavior. Such behavior took
    place in a number of recent popular crowdsourcing competitions. We provide game-theoretic
    analysis of a fundamental tradeoff between the potential for increased productivity
    and the possibility of being set back by malicious behavior. Our results show
    that in crowdsourcing competitions malicious behavior is the norm, not the anomaly---a
    result contrary to the conventional wisdom in the area. Counterintuitively, making
    the attacks more costly does not deter them but leads to a less desirable outcome.
    These findings have cautionary implications for the design of crowdsourcing competitions.

  abstract: 'To explore the privacy implications of health big data, and to develop
    concrete proposals for how to resolve privacy issues and at the same time reap
    the benefits of big data techniques, CDT has undertaken a series of consultations
    with stakeholders and experts. We examined three scenarios: (1) clinical and administrative
    data generated by health care providers and payers; (2) health data contributed
    by consumers using the Internet and other consumer-facing technologies; and (3)
    health data collected by federal, state, and local governments. In this paper,
    we focus on the second of these scenarios: health data collected by non-HIPAA-covered
    entities through consumer-facing technologies. This includes mobile apps, wearable
    devices, personal health record platforms, social networks, and any other consumer-facing
    entities outside of the HIPAA framework that collect or share health data relating
    to individuals. We refer to these as consumer-facing entities, and we refer to
    their products and services as consumer products. We look both at big data uses
    by those entities, and at their disclosures of data to third parties for research
    and other analytic purposes.'

    is becoming a key competitive parameter. Companies, organisations and authorities
    that treat data ethics as a social responsibility as important as environmental

    combined foster a growing market for data ethical products and services. It provides
    a critical and fresh look at tech trends and the ethical dilemmas intertwined
    with them. It is a book for responsible players on how to get started with data
    ethics and how to use it to develop digital trust. The book is supported by Internet

  abstract: The digital exhaust left by flows of physical and digital commodities
    provides a rich measure of the nature, strength and significance of relationships
    between countries in the global network. With this work, we examine how these
    traces and the network structure can reveal the socioeconomic profile of different
    countries. We take into account multiple international networks of physical and
    digital flows, including the previously unexplored international postal network.
    By measuring the position of each country in the Trade, Postal, Migration, International
    Flights, IP and Digital Communications networks, we are able to build proxies
    for a number of crucial socioeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita and the
    Human Development Index ranking along with twelve other indicators used as benchmarks
    of national well-being by the United Nations and other international organisations.
    In this context, we have also proposed and evaluated a global connectivity degree
    measure applying multiplex theory across the six networks that accounts for the
    strength of relationships between countries. We conclude by showing how countries
    with shared community membership over multiple networks have similar socioeconomic
    profiles. Combining multiple flow data sources can help understand the forces
    which drive economic activity on a global level. Such an ability to infer proxy
    indicators in a context of incomplete information is extremely timely in light

  abstract: 'This article looks at the promise of technology to revolutionise humanitarian
    action, especially in terms of the gathering and use of data. With many heralding
    a ‘data revolution’, the opportunities and enthusiasm for using social media and
    SMS data in crisis response are on the rise. The article constructs an analytical
    framework in order to scrutinise the three main claims made on behalf of technologically
    advanced humanitarian information systems: that they can access data more accurately,
    more quickly, and alter power relations in emancipatory ways. It does so in relation
    to two aspects of digital humanitarianism: visual technology and crisis mapping,
    and big data. The article is partly informed by a historical perspective, but
    also by interview and other material that suggests some of the claims made on
    behalf of technology are exaggerated. In particular, we argue that the enthusiasm
    for the data is vastly outstripped by the capacity to meaningfully analyse it.
    We conclude by scoping the implications of the future technological evolution
    of humanitarianism, in particular by examining how technology contributes to what
    Duffield terms ‘post-modern humanitarianism’.'

    In recent years, a diverse coalition of actors has pushed the creation and diffusion of open data programmes around the world. Governments, international organizations, businesses, academics, media, civil society organizations, and web developers have embraced and sponsored open data programs creating large expectations a suitable remedy for challenges of good governance, economic growth, social inclusion, innovation, and participation.

    Though in many cases this may be true, there is a need for a critical perspective on whether the outcomes indeed occur and under what circumstances. There is a widespread lack of empirical evidence underlying the implementation of Open Data initiative and that can guide better practice and policy formulation, particularly as it spreads to developing countries. Thus, this initial consultation explored substantive and procedural options for the implementation of a research agenda aimed at better understanding the impact of open data.

    This meeting brought together 20 renowned policy-oriented academics coming from diverse geographical areas and backgrounds in order to discuss an interdisciplinary research agenda on the impact of Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives under political, economic and social dimensions. The meeting included a debate on potential research questions and approaches that could inform an international research network on the impact of Open Government Data (OGD) in developing countries.

    The participants also expressed the commitment to the further development of the research agenda and demonstrated their interest in participate in a research network in different forms. They added a number of considerations and contributions for the development of a research network that would address these challenges.

    generally used to represent efforts that in different ways describe a comprehensive
    vision of a city for the present and future. A smarter city infuses information
    into its physical infrastructure to improve conveniences, facilitate mobility,
    add efficiencies, conserve energy, improve the quality of air and water, identify
    problems and fix them quickly, recover rapidly from disasters, collect data to
    make better decisions, deploy resources effectively and share data to enable collaboration

    The purpose of this report is to learn lessons by looking at the use of internal collaborative tools across the Intelligence Community. The initial rubric was tools, but the real focus is collaboration, for while the tools can enable, what ultimately matters are policies and practices interacting with organizational culture. It looks for good practices to emulate. The ultimate question is how and how much could, and should, collaborative tools foster integration across the Community. The focus is analysis and the analytic process, but collaborative tools can and do serve many other functions in the Intelligence Community—from improving logistics or human resources, to better connecting collection and analysis, to assisting administration and development, to facilitating, as one interlocutor put it, operational “go” decisions. Yet it is in the analytic realm that collaboration is both most visible and most rubs against traditional work processes that are not widely collaborative.

    The report defines terms and discusses concepts, first exploring collaboration and coordination, then defining collaborative tools and social media, then surveying the experience of the private sector. The second section of the report uses those distinctions to sort out the blizzard of collaborative tools that have been created in the various intelligence agencies and across them. The third section outlines the state of collaboration, again both within agencies and across them. The report concludes with findings and recommendations for the Community. The recommendations amount to a continuum of possible actions in making more strategic what is and will continue to be more a bottom-up process of creating and adopting collaborative tools and practices.

  abstract: 'Social media are being increasingly used for health promotion, yet the
    landscape of users, messages and interactions in such fora is poorly understood.
    Studies of social media and diabetes have focused mostly on patients, or public
    agencies addressing it, but have not looked broadly at all the participants or
    the diversity of content they contribute. We study Twitter conversations about
    diabetes through the systematic analysis of 2.5 million tweets collected over
    8 months and the interactions between their authors. We address three questions:
    (1) what themes arise in these tweets?; (2) who are the most influential users?;
    (3) which type of users contribute to which themes? We answer these questions
    using a mixed-methods approach, integrating techniques from anthropology, network
    science and information retrieval such as thematic coding, temporal network analysis,
    and community and topic detection. Diabetes-related tweets fall within broad thematic
    groups: health information, news, social interaction, and commercial. At the same
    time, humorous messages and references to popular culture appear consistently,
    more than any other type of tweet. We classify authors according to their temporal
    ''hub'' and ''authority'' scores. Whereas the hub landscape is diffuse and fluid
    over time, top authorities are highly persistent across time and comprise bloggers,
    advocacy groups and NGOs related to diabetes, as well as for-profit entities without
    specific diabetes expertise. Top authorities fall into seven interest communities
    as derived from their Twitter follower network. Our findings have implications
    for public health professionals and policy makers who seek to use social media
    as an engagement tool and to inform policy design.'

  abstract: |-
    Introduction: People’s online activities can yield clues about their emerging health conditions. We performed an intensive study to explore the feasibility of using anonymized Web query logs to screen for the emergence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The methods used statistical analyses of large-scale anonymized search logs considering the symptom queries from millions of people, with the potential application of warning individual searchers about the value of seeking attention from health care professionals.

    Methods: We identified searchers in logs of online search activity who issued special queries that are suggestive of a recent diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We then went back many months before these landmark queries were made, to examine patterns of symptoms, which were expressed as searches about concerning symptoms. We built statistical classifiers that predicted the future appearance of the landmark queries based on patterns of signals seen in search logs.

    Results: We found that signals about patterns of queries in search logs can predict the future appearance of queries that are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We showed specifically that we can identify 5% to 15% of cases, while preserving extremely low false-positive rates (0.00001 to 0.0001).

    Conclusion: Signals in search logs show the possibilities of predicting a forthcoming diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma from combinations of subtle temporal signals revealed in the queries of searchers.

  abstract: 'This short article argues that an adequate response to the implications

    this through two contrasting examples: the sociological study of social actors
    used of analytics to meet their own social ends (for example, by community organisations)
    and the study of actors’ attempts to build an economy of information more open
    to civic intervention than the existing one (for example, in the environmental
    sphere). The article concludes with a consideration of the broader norms that
    might contextualise these empirical studies, and proposes that they can be understood
    in terms of the notion of voice, although the practical implementation of voice
    as a norm means that voice must sometimes be considered via the notion of transparency.'

  abstract: This article examines the emergence of democratic deliberation in a crowdsourced
    law reform process. The empirical context of the study is a crowdsourced legislative
    reform in Finland, initiated by the Finnish government. The findings suggest that
    online exchanges in the crowdsourced process qualify as democratic deliberation
    according to the classical definition. We introduce the term “crowdsourced deliberation”
    to mean an open, asynchronous, depersonalized, and distributed kind of online
    deliberation occurring among self-selected participants in the context of an attempt
    by government or another organization to open up the policymaking or lawmaking
    process. The article helps to characterize the nature of crowdsourced policymaking
    and to understand its possibilities as a practice for implementing open government
    principles. We aim to make a contribution to the literature on crowdsourcing in
    policymaking, participatory and deliberative democracy and, specifically, the
    newly emerging subfield in deliberative democracy that focuses on “deliberative
    systems.”

  abstract: Earthquake early warning (EEW) can reduce harm to people and infrastructure
    from earthquakes and tsunamis, but it has not been implemented in most high earthquake-risk
    regions because of prohibitive cost. Common consumer devices such as smartphones
    contain low-cost versions of the sensors used in EEW. Although less accurate than
    scientific-grade instruments, these sensors are globally ubiquitous. Through controlled
    tests of consumer devices, simulation of an Mw (moment magnitude) 7 earthquake
    on California’s Hayward fault, and real data from the Mw 9 Tohoku-oki earthquake,
    we demonstrate that EEW could be achieved via crowdsourcing.

  abstract: 'This study examines participatory budgeting (PB) as an important kind
    of citizen participation in the Dominican Republic (DR) and the implications of
    this recent practice for agency, democracy, and development. PB is a process that
    intends to drive change with specific outcomes: through deliberative decision-making,
    ordinary citizens select well-being- and agency-enhancing projects that ideally
    lead to more local and authentic development. Together with the attainment of
    these tangible outcomes, valuable subjective states may also come about: people
    feel more in charge of their own lives, community groups become more collaborative
    and cooperative, and more and better democracy is fostered. Taking a step forward
    from previous studies that only focus on PB from an urban planning or public finance
    perspective, the overall objective of this study is to provide a deeper understanding
    and assessment of how PB works in the localities under analysis, its association
    with different measures of agency, the characteristics that drive its success
    or failure, and its general impact on the lives of individuals and communities.
    Drawing on normative and policy-based literatures and specifically following an
    agency-oriented capability approach, this study uses a mixed-methods approach
    to analyze interview, survey, and direct observations of PB public assemblies,
    and archival data with respect to the 2013 budget cycle in four DR municipalities.
    A regression analysis finds that participation in and awareness of PB are both
    significantly correlated with individuals reporting higher levels of individual
    and collective agency when compared to non-participants and unaware individuals.
    These measures of agency are contextualized to the municipal budget-planning cycle.
    A process tracing analysis concludes that PB is likely, under certain conditions,
    to increase democratic participation and deliberation. However, due to certain
    democratic deficits, PB in two DR municipalities does not always increase agency,
    group cooperative functioning, and good development. Thus, PB must be analyzed
    on a case-by-case basis because differences in the characteristics of each PB
    assembly may lead to different outcomes. It is finally argued that rather than
    condemning democracy because of the failures of the current PB system, we should
    advance PB''s democracy further by improving it in various ways.'

  abstract: Governments collect and produce large amounts of data. Increasingly, governments
    worldwide have started to implement open data initiatives and also launch open
    data portals to enable the release of these data in open and reusable formats.
    Therefore, a large number of open data repositories, catalogues and portals have
    been emerging in the world. The greater availability of interoperable and linkable
    open government data catalyzes secondary use of such data, so they can be used
    for building useful applications which leverage their value, allow insight, provide
    access to government services, and support transparency. The efficient development
    of successful open data portals makes it necessary to evaluate them systematic,
    in order to understand them better and assess the various types of value they
    generate, and identify the required improvements for increasing this value. Thus,
    the attention of this paper is directed particularly to the field of open data
    portals. The main aim of this paper is to compare the selected open data portals
    on the national level using content analysis and propose a new evaluation framework,
    which further improves the quality of these portals. It also establishes a set
    of considerations for involving businesses and citizens to create eservices and
    applications that leverage on the datasets available from these portals.

  abstract: Social media platforms risk polarising public opinions by employing proprietary
    algorithms that produce filter bubbles and echo chambers. As a result, the ability
    of citizens and communities to engage in robust debate in the public sphere is
    diminished. In response, this paper highlights the capacity of urban interfaces,
    such as pervasive displays, to counteract this trend by exposing citizens to the
    socio-cultural diversity of the city. Engagement with different ideas, networks
    and communities is crucial to both innovation and the functioning of democracy.
    We discuss examples of urban interfaces designed to play a key role in fostering
    this engagement. Based on an analysis of works empirically-grounded in field observations
    and design research, we call for a theoretical framework that positions pervasive
    displays and other urban interfaces as civic media. We argue that when designed
    for more than wayfinding, advertisement or television broadcasts, urban screens
    as civic media can rectify some of the pitfalls of social media by allowing the
    polarised user to break out of their filter bubble and embrace the cultural diversity
    and richness of the city.

    mechanisms as an essential element in unlocking the potential for open data to
    produce better governmental decisions and policies. Finally, I conduct an empirical
    analysis of the publicity and political agency conditions in countries that have
    launched open data efforts, highlighting the challenges associated with open data

  abstract: "This GovLab Working Paper is an attempt to describe the promise and challenge
    of evaluating new practices of\nproblem solving in governance, specifically citizen-engagement
    interventions. The purpose is to inform those innovators\nwho are eager to develop
    a deeper insight into what works for the key steps, opportunities and challenges\ninvolved
    when assessing impact. In addition, the paper aims to develop a foundation for
    further interdisciplinary\nresearch and debate.\nThis paper summarizes the recent
    lessons learned in the field of evaluation and examines how new methods could\nhelp
    assess the impacts of participatory governance and emerging social technologies
    used in governance. This\nwork is not meant to be a comprehensive review of current
    approaches to evaluating new governance initiatives\nbut is intended to frame
    the issues involved, and suggest where work needs to be done to develop better
    assessments.\nWe are also providing an annotated and open bibliography for further
    reading, inviting others to expand\nupon it. "

  abstract: 'Terrorism, cyberbullying, child pornography, hate speech, cybercrime:
    along with unprecedented advancements in productivity and engagement, the Internet
    has ushered in a space for violent, hateful, and antisocial behavior. How do we,
    as individuals and as a society, protect against dangerous expressions online?
    Confronting the Internet''s Dark Side is the first book on social responsibility
    on the Internet. It aims to strike a balance between the free speech principle
    and the responsibilities of the individual, corporation, state, and the international
    community. This book brings a global perspective to the analysis of some of the
    most troubling uses of the Internet. It urges net users, ISPs, and liberal democracies
    to weigh freedom and security, finding the golden mean between unlimited license
    and moral responsibility. This judgment is necessary to uphold the very liberal
    democratic values that gave rise to the Internet and that are threatened by an
    unbridled use of technology.'

  abstract: This research examines the conditions under which Chinese central government
    ministries and provincial governments implement online consultation, a prominent
    instrument of governance reform in which officials provide interested parties
    with opportunities to offer feedback on proposed public policies. The research
    assembles original data regarding the online consultation practices of more than
    one hundred central government ministries and provincial governments. The analysis
    demonstrates that online consultation practices are more developed in provincial
    governments than central government ministries. Across organizational contexts,
    online consultation is more advanced in the disclosure of proposed policies than
    in the circulation of feedback submitted in response to draft laws and regulations.
    Finally, online consultation is primarily utilized by organizations with substantial
    resources, as well as organizations operating in environments not characterized
    by fundamental political sensitivities. These results are consistent with the
    expectation that although online consultation increases information disclosure
    and public participation in government decision making, such reforms are indicative
    not of the end of authoritarianism but rather the resilience of the Chinese Communist
    Party.

  abstract: The overflow of information generated during disasters can be as paralyzing
    to humanitarian response as the lack of information. Making sense of this information--Big
    Data--is proving an impossible challenge for traditional humanitarian organizations,
    which is precisely why they're turning to Digital Humanitarians. This new humanitarians
    mobilize online to make sense of vast volumes of data--social media and text messages;
    satellite and aerial imagery--in direct support of relief efforts worldwide. How?
    They craft ingenious crowdsourcing solutions with trail-blazing insights from
    artificial intelligence. This book charts the spectacular rise of Digital Humanitarians,
    highlighting how their humanity coupled with innovative Big Data solutions is
    changing humanitarian relief for forever.

  abstract: 'Open government initiatives, which include not only transparency but
    also participation and collaboration policies, have become a major administrative
    reform. As such, these initiatives are gaining cohesiveness in literature. President
    Obama supported open government through a range of policies including the Open
    Government Partnership (OGP), a multinational initiative. The OGP requires member
    organizations to develop open government national action plans, which are used
    as the basis for my analysis. To frame this paper, I use and expand upon David
    Heald’s directions and varieties of transparency framework. A content analysis
    of the 62 commitments in the US Second Open Government National Action Plan was
    conducted. The analysis provides two findings of note: First, the traditional
    view of transparency was indeed the most prevalent in the policies proposed. In
    that respect, not much has changed, even with the OGP’s emphasis on a range moof
    approaches. Second, openness among and between agencies played a larger than expected
    role. While the OGP pushed an array of administrative reforms, the initiative
    had limited impact on the type of policies that were proposed and enacted. In
    sum, the OGP is an administrative reform that was launched with great fanfare,
    but limited influence in the US context. More research needs to be conducted to
    determine is the “open government reform” movement as a whole suffers from such
    problems in implementation.'

  abstract: A behavioral divide cuts across the Atlantic. Despite the recent surge
    of behavioral analysis in European academia, a scrutiny of decisions by courts
    and regulatory agencies in the US and the EU reveals striking differences. While
    in the US rulings by courts and regulatory agencies progressively take insights
    from behavioral economics into account, EU courts and agencies still, and even
    increasingly, cling to the rational actor model. These inverse trends can be uncovered
    in the interpretation of legal concepts of human agency, ie, of those elements
    in a legal order which refer, implicitly or explicitly, to a model of rationality
    of human actors. More particularly, this paper reviews the concepts of consumers
    and of users, in consumer law and product liability respectively, to underscore
    the claim of the behavioral divide. Importantly, the divergence between EU and
    US private law practice calls for a normative evaluation. In the face of empirical
    uncertainty about the existence, direction and intensity of biases, the most attractive
    legal concept of human agency is a pluralistic one, assuming the simultaneous
    presence of boundedly and fully rational actors. In concrete applications, this
    paper shows that a pluralistic perspective urges a revision of the concept of
    the reasonable consumer, both in US and EU consumer law. Furthermore, such a view
    leads to the adoption of a more boundedly rational user concept in product liability.
    The pluralistic, yet more boundedly rational concepts thus have far-reaching consequences
    both for private law theory and its concomitant case law.

  abstract: Movements towards open data involve the publication of datasets (from
    metadata on publications, to research, to operational project statistics) online
    in standard formats and without restrictions on reuse. A number of open datasets
    are published as linked data, creating a web of connected datasets. Governments,
    companies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) across the world are increasingly
    exploring how the publication and use of open and linked data can have impacts
    on governance, economic growth and the delivery of services. This article outlines
    the historical, social and technical trajectories that have led to current interest
    in, and practices around, open data. Drawing on three example cases of working
    with open and linked data it takes a critical look at issues that development
    sector knowledge intermediaries may need to engage with to ensure the socio-technical
    innovations of open and linked data work in the interests of greater diversity
    and better development practice.

  abstract: In recent years the necessity for governments to develop new public values
    of openness and transparency, and thereby increase their citizenries' sense of
    inclusiveness, and their trust in and confidence about their governments, has
    risen to the point of urgency. The decline of trust in governments, especially
    in developing countries, has been unprecedented and continuous. A new paradigm
    that signifies a shift to citizen-driven initiatives over and above state- and
    market-centric ones calls for innovative thinking that requires openness in government.
    The need for this new synergy notwithstanding, Open Government cannot be considered
    truly open unless it also enhances citizen participation and engagement. The Ghana
    Open Data Initiative (GODI) project strives to create an open data community that
    will enable government (supply side) and civil society in general (demand side)
    to exchange data and information. We argue that the GODI is too narrowly focused
    on the supply side of the project, and suggest that it should generate an even
    platform to improve interaction between government and citizens to ensure a balance
    in knowledge sharing with and among all constituencies.

    This research explores government sharing of personal information across ministries and services, or
    with the private sector for the provision of services. The report reviews material from many sources
    on government data sharing activities with a particular focus on privacy. There is no explicit or
    consensus framework for assessing or evaluating data sharing. While data sharing goes on in
    Canada it does so under the rather antique framework of public sector laws that ill equip privacy
    practitioners to deal with data mining realities of 2014. Meanwhile, there is ongoing discussion how
    or whether privacy expectations need adjustment to reflect the new reality of “big data”.

  abstract: Participation in discussions about the public interest can be enhanced
    by technology, but can also create an environment in which participants are overwhelmed
    by the quantity, quality, and diversity of information and arguments. Political
    participation is at a greater disadvantage than non-political activities in that
    participants from different parties already start out with established differences,
    which requires them to reach some form of common ground before progress can be
    made. Those seeking authentic deliberation are discouraged to participate when
    confronted with uncivil and inflammatory rhetoric. These issues are often exacerbated
    in online discussions, where lack of identity cues and low barriers to entry can
    lead to heightened incivility between participants, often labeled as “flaming”
    and “trolling”. This paper explores the extent to which moderator systems, tools
    online discussion forums use to manage contributions, can reduce information overload
    and encourage civil conversations in virtual discussion spaces. Using the popular
    website Slashdot as an example of sound moderation in a public discourse setting,
    we found that users move toward consensus about which and how comments deserve
    to be moderated. Using these findings, we explore how transferable these systems
    are for participation in public matters specifically to the unique attributes
    of political discussion. Slashdot's political forum provides a comparison group
    that allowed us to find quantitative and qualitative differences in political
    posting, comments, and moderation. Our results show that large scale, civil participation
    is possible with a distributed moderation system that enables regularly lively
    debates to be conducted positively because the system provides tools for people
    to enforce norms of civility.

  abstract: "In February 2016, Wellcome Trust organized a pledge among leading scientific
    organizations and health agencies encouraging researchers to release data relevant
    to the Zika outbreak as rapidly and widely as possible [1]. This initiative echoed
    a September 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) consultation that assessed data
    sharing during the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak and called on researchers
    to make data publicly available during public health emergencies [2]. These statements
    were necessary because the traditional way of communicating research results—publication
    in peer-reviewed journals, often months or years after data collection—is too
    slow during an emergency.\n \n The acute health threat of outbreaks provides a
    strong argument for more complete, quick, and broad sharing of research data during
    emergencies. But the Ebola and Zika outbreaks suggest that data sharing cannot
    be limited to emergencies without compromising emergency preparedness. To prepare
    for future outbreaks, the scientific community should expand data sharing for
    all health research."

  abstract: |-
    In recent years we have witnessed a shift in the innovation landscape of organizations from closed to more open models embracing solutions from the outside. Widespread use of the internet and web 2.0 technologies have made it easier for organizations to connect with their clients, service providers, and the public at large for more collaborative problem solving and innovation. Introduction of the Open Government initiative accompanied by the America Competes Reauthorization Act signaled an unprecedented commitment by the US Federal Government to stimulating more innovation and creativity in problem solving. The policy and legislation empowered agencies to open up their problem solving space beyond their regular pool of contractors in finding solutions to the nation's most complex problems.

    This is an exploratory study of the adoption of challenges as an organizational innovation in public sector organizations. The main objective is to understand and explain how, and under what conditions challenges are being used by federal agencies and departments as a tool to promote innovation. The organizational innovation literature provides the main theoretical foundation for this study, but does not directly address contextual aspects regarding the type of innovation and the type of organization. The guiding framework uses concepts drawn from three literature streams: organizational innovation, open innovation, and public sector innovation.

    Research was conducted using a qualitative case study of challenge.gov. Data was collected from multiple adopting agencies using two primary sources: interviews with challenge managers and administrators and, archival data from the challenge.gov web platform. Related documentation was used to supplement and corroborate the main data. Analysis of the platform archival data revealed four types of challenges falling along a continuum of increasing innovation. The sequence of events, activities and conditions leading to adoption and implementation were represented as a challenge adoption model. Variations among components of the model resulted in three distinct agency groupings represented as a typology of enactments characterized as inertia, application, and change. Thus challenge adoption among agencies with varying missions, operations and conditions leads to varying enactment types and different levels of change.

  abstract: Natural disasters affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide every
    year. Emergency response efforts depend upon the availability of timely information,
    such as information concerning the movements of affected populations. The analysis
    of aggregated and anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) captured from the mobile
    phone infrastructure provides new possibilities to characterize human behavior
    during critical events. In this work, we investigate the viability of using CDR
    data combined with other sources of information to characterize the floods that
    occurred in Tabasco, Mexico in 2009. An impact map has been reconstructed using
    Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within this frame, the underlying communication
    activity signals in the CDR data have been analyzed and compared against rainfall
    levels extracted from data of the NASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number
    of active phones connected to each cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns
    in the most affected locations during and after the floods that could be used
    as signatures of the floods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment
    and population information awareness. The representativeness of the analysis has
    been assessed using census data and civil protection records. While a more extensive
    validation is required, these early results suggest high potential in using cell
    tower activity information to improve early warning and emergency management mechanisms.

  abstract: The potential of open data as a resource for driving citizen-led urban
    innovation relies not only on a suitable technical infrastructure but also on
    the skills and knowledge of the citizens themselves. This paper describes how
    a smart city project in Milton Keynes, UK, is supporting multiple stages of citizen
    innovation, from ideation through to citizen-led smart city projects. This approach
    encounters challenges when engaging with citizens in identifying and implementing
    data-driven solutions to urban problems. The majority of citizens have little
    practical experience with the types of data sets that might be availa- ble, nor
    possess the appropriate skills for their analysis and utilisation for ad- dressing
    urban issues, or finding novel ways to hack their city. We go on to de- scribe
    the Urban Data School, which aims to offer a long-term solution to this problem
    by providing teaching resources around urban data sets aimed at rais- ing the
    standard of data literacy amongst future generations. Lesson resources that form
    part of the Urban Data School have been piloted in a primary and two secondary
    schools in Milton Keynes.

  abstract: Governments are increasingly adopting online platforms to engage the public
    and allow a broad and diverse group of citizens to participate in the planning
    of government policies. To understand the role of crowds in the online public
    policy process, we analyse participant contributions over time in two crowd-based
    policy processes, the Future Melbourne wiki and the Open Government Dialogue.
    Although past evaluations have shown the significance of public consultations
    by expanding the engaged population within a short period of time, our empirical
    case studies suggest that a small number of participants contribute a disproportionate
    share of ideas and opinions. We discuss the implications of our initial examination
    for the future design of engagement platforms.

  abstract: Open data initiatives are characterized, in several countries, by a great
    extension of the number of data sets made available for access by public administrations,
    constituencies, businesses and other actors, such as journalists, international
    institutions and academics, to mention a few. However, most of the open data sets
    rely on selection criteria, based on a technology-driven perspective, rather than
    a focus on the potential public and social value of data to be published. Several
    experiences and reports confirm this issue, such as those of the Open Data Census.
    However, there are also relevant best practices. The goal of this paper is to
    investigate the different dimensions of a framework suitable to support public
    administrations, as well as constituencies, in assessing and benchmarking the
    social value of open data initiatives. The framework is tested on three initiatives,
    referring to three different countries, Italy, the United Kingdom and Tunisia.
    The countries have been selected to provide a focus on European and Mediterranean
    countries, considering also the difference in legal frameworks (civic law vs.
    common law countries).

  abstract: Smart cities are associated almost exclusively with modern technology

    the role of governance as one of the factors influencing the participation of
    citizens in smart cities projects. Governance characteristics play a major role
    in explaining different typologies of citizen participation. Through a focus on
    Amsterdam Smart City program as a specific case study, this research examines
    the characteristics of governance that are present in the overall program and
    within a selected sample of projects, and how they relate to different typologies
    of citizen participation. The analysis and comprehension of governance characteristics
    plays a crucial role both for a better understanding and management of citizen
    participation, especially in complex settings where multiple actors are interacting.

  abstract: Crowdsourcing is beginning to be used for policymaking. The “wisdom of
    crowds” [Surowiecki 2005], and crowdsourcing [Brabham 2008], are seen as new avenues
    that can shape all kinds of policy, from transportation policy [Nash 2009] to
    urban planning [Seltzer and Mahmoudi 2013], to climate policy. In general, many
    have high expectations for positive outcomes with crowdsourcing, and based on
    both anecdotal and empirical evidence, some of these expectations seem justified
    [Majchrzak and Malhotra 2013]. Yet, to our knowledge, research has yet to emerge
    that unpacks the different forms of crowdsourcing in light of each stage of the
    well-established policy cycle. This work addresses this research gap, and in doing
    so brings increased nuance to the application of crowdsourcing techniques for
    policymaking.

  abstract: Open data has been recognized as a valuable resource, and public institutions
    have taken to publishing their data under open licenses, also in Germany. However,
    German public transit agencies are still reluctant to publish their schedules
    as open data. Also, two widely used data exchange formats used in German transit
    planning are proprietary, with no documentation publicly available. Through this
    work, one of the proprietary formats was reverse-engineered, and a transformation
    process into the open GTFS schedule format was developed. This process allowed
    a partnering transit operator to publish their schedule as open data. Also, through
    a survey taken with German transit authorities and operators, the prevalence of
    transit data exchange formats, and reservations concerning open transit data were
    evaluated. The survey brought a series of issues to light which serve as obstacles
    for opening up transit data. Addressing the issues found through this work, and
    partnering with open-minded transit authorities to further develop transit data
    publishing processes can serve as a foundation for wider adoption of publishing
    open transit data in Germany.

  abstract: |-
    Transnational multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) – voluntary partnerships between governments, civil society, and the private sector – are an increasingly prevalent strategy for promoting government responsiveness and accountability to citizens. While most transnational MSIs involve using voluntary standards to encourage socially and environmentally responsible private sector behavior, a handful of these initiatives – the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (CoST), the Open Government Partnership (OGP), the Global Initiative on Fiscal Transparency (GIFT) and the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP) – focus on information disclosure and participation in the public sector. Unlike private sector MSIs, which attempt to supplement weak government capacity to enforce basic social and environmental standards through partnerships between businesses and civil society, public sector MSIs ultimately seek to bolster public governance. But how exactly are these MSIs supposed to work? And how much has actually been achieved?

    The purpose of this study is to identify and consolidate the current state of the evidence for public governance-oriented MSI effectiveness and impact. Researchers collected over 300 documents and interviewed more than two-dozen MSI stakeholders about their experiences with five public governance oriented multi-stakeholder initiatives.

    This report provides a ‘snapshot’ of the evidence related to these five MSIs, and suggests that the process of leveraging transparency and participation through these initiatives for broader accountability gains remains uncertain. The report highlights the ongoing process of defining MSI success and impact, and how these initiatives intersect with other accountability actors and processes in complex ways. The study closes with key recommendations for MSI stakeholders.

  abstract: This paper introduces Google Votes, an experiment in liquid democracy
    built on Google's internal corporate Google+ social network. Liquid democracy
    decision-making systems can scale to cover large groups by enabling voters to
    delegate their votes to other voters. This approach is in contrast to direct democracy
    systems where voters vote directly on issues, and representative democracy systems
    where voters elect representatives to vote on issues for them. Liquid democracy
    systems can provide many of the benefits of both direct and representative democracy
    systems with few of the weaknesses. Thus far, high implementation complexity and
    infrastructure costs have prevented widespread adoption. Google Votes demonstrates
    how the use of social-networking technology can overcome these barriers and enable
    practical liquid democracy systems. The case-study of Google Votes usage at Google
    over a 3 year timeframe is included, as well as a framework for evaluating vote
    visibility called the "Golden Rule of Liquid Democracy".

    Assuming cognitive biases to be present in the market, but not in politics, behavioral

    however, political economists have started to apply behavioral economics insights
    to the study of political processes, thereby re-establishing a unified methodology.

    evaluation and ‘design-for-policy’ techniques as methods for the governing of
    education. In particular, they promote the ‘computational thinking’ associated
    with computer programming as a capacity required by a ‘reluctant state’ that is
    increasingly concerned to delegate its responsibilities to digitally enabled citizens
    with the ‘designerly’ capacities and technical expertise to ‘code’ solutions to
    public and social problems. Policy innovation labs are experimental laboratories
    trialling new methods within education for administering and governing the future

    big data in the public sector context. The article is exploratory and reviews
    both academic- and practitioner–oriented literature related to big data developments.
    The findings suggest that big data will have an impact on the future role of public
    sector organizations in functional areas. However, the author also reveals that
    there are challenges to be addressed by governments in adopting big data applications.
    To realize the benefits of big data, policy-makers need to: invest in research;
    create incentives for private and public sector entities to share data; and set
    up programmes to develop appropriate skills.'

  abstract: 'Arguably the most important decision at an arraignment is whether to
    release an offender until the date of his or her next scheduled court appearance.
    Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, threats to public safety can be a key factor
    in that decision. Implicitly, a forecast of “future dangerousness” is required.
    In this article, we consider in particular whether usefully accurate forecasts
    of domestic violence can be obtained. We apply machine learning to data on over
    28,000 arraignment cases from a major metropolitan area in which an offender faces
    domestic violence charges. One of three possible post-arraignment outcomes is
    forecasted within two years: (1) a domestic violence arrest associated with a
    physical injury, (2) a domestic violence arrest not associated with a physical
    injury, and (3) no arrests for domestic violence. We incorporate asymmetric costs
    for different kinds of forecasting errors so that very strong statistical evidence
    is required before an offender is forecasted to be a good risk. When an out-of-sample
    forecast of no post-arraignment domestic violence arrests within two years is
    made, it is correct about 90 percent of the time. Under current practice within
    the jurisdiction studied, approximately 20 percent of those released after an
    arraignment for domestic violence are arrested within two years for a new domestic
    violence offense. If magistrates used the methods we have developed and released
    only offenders forecasted not to be arrested for domestic violence within two
    years after an arraignment, as few as 10 percent might be arrested. The failure
    rate could be cut nearly in half. Over a typical 24-month period in the jurisdiction
    studied, well over 2,000 post-arraignment arrests for domestic violence perhaps
    could be averted.'

  abstract: "The social and economic shifts of the past few decades have hardened
    the deeply held scepticism and distrust of ‘the establishment’. In an age of historically
    low party membership, party identification, voter volatility, rising abstentionism
    and greater individualism, mainstream parties are struggling to be representative.
    This book is about the turbulent political scene unfolding in Britain and across
    western Europe. It focuses on why large swathes of voters feel that politics does
    not work, how this fuels support for insurgent parties and actors, and it investigates
    the power of democratic innovations. \n\nDrawing on new survey data in the UK,
    as well as interviews and case studies, the book shows that people are concerned
    with the process of politics, not merely its performance, and that they have a
    genuine desire for greater political participation in the decision-making process.
    These new forms of political engagement should not feel like a threat to formal
    systems of government, but as much-needed additions that enrich democracy. "

    Digital technology undoubtedly has huge potential to contribute to the functions of government and public administration, but so far the building of information portals and putting transactions on government web sites have not realised the great expectations for it in terms of “transforming government”. This Working Paper explores why the ambitions for transformational e-government (however it has been labelled) over the last 20 years have not been realised. It provides a critical analysis to offer a diagnosis of the problem and its causes. In the hope of a better future, it develops a structured frame of reference for making sense of how information and communications technologies (ICT), in all their forms, really fit within the world of government and public administration.

    To actually achieve a transformation of government through the use of digital technologies, governments will require a complete reversal of the current way of looking at the challenge. Instead of viewing the problem from the point of view of the internet, they must start with the political process of policy design. In particular, they must look at how technology can change the range and characteristics of policy instruments — the tools that governments choose from to intervene in the economy, society and environment to make change, such as taxes, benefits, licences, information campaigns and more tangible things like public services and infrastructure. These are the practical results of government, and only when technology changes those can we say it has transformed government.

  abstract: 'Due to expected benefits such as citizen participation and innovation,
    the release of Public Sector Information as open data is getting increased attention
    on various levels of government. However, currently data release by governments
    is still novel and there is little experience and knowledge thus far about its
    benefits, costs and barriers. This is compounded by a lack of understanding about
    how internal processes influence data release. Our aim in this paper is to get
    a better understanding of these processes and how they influence data release,
    i.e., to find determinants for the release of public sector information. For this
    purpose, we conducted workshops, interviews, questionnaires, desk research and
    practice based cases in the education program of our university, involving six
    local public sector organizations. We find that the way data is stored, the way
    data is obtained and the way data is used by a department are crucial indicators
    for open data release. We conclude with the lessons learned based on our research
    findings. These findings are: we should take a nuanced approach towards data release,
    avoid releasing data for its own sake, and take small incremental steps to explore
    data release.'

  abstract: The growing participation in social networking sites is altering the nature
    of social relations and changing the nature of political and public dialogue.
    This paper contributes to the current debate on Web 2.0 technologies and their
    implications for local governance, identifying the perceptions of policy makers
    on the use of Web 2.0 in providing public services and on the changing roles that
    could arise from the resulting interaction between local governments and their
    stakeholders. The results obtained suggest that policy makers are willing to implement
    Web 2.0 technologies in providing public services, but preferably under the Bureaucratic
    model framework, thus retaining a leading role in this implementation. The learning
    curve of local governments in the use of Web 2.0 technologies is a factor that
    could influence policy makers’ perceptions. In this respect, many research gaps
    are identified and further study of the question is recommended.

  abstract: Until now, most large-scale studies of humans have either focused on very
    specific domains of inquiry or have relied on between-subjects approaches. While
    these previous studies have been invaluable for revealing important biological
    factors in cardiac health or social factors in retirement choices, no single repository
    contains anything like a complete record of the health, education, genetics, environmental,
    and lifestyle profiles of a large group of individuals at the within-subject level.
    This seems critical today because emerging evidence about the dynamic interplay
    between biology, behavior, and the environment point to a pressing need for just
    the kind of large-scale, long-term synoptic dataset that does not yet exist at
    the within-subject level. At the same time that the need for such a dataset is
    becoming clear, there is also growing evidence that just such a synoptic dataset
    may now be obtainable—at least at moderate scale—using contemporary big data approaches.
    To this end, we introduce the Kavli HUMAN Project (KHP), an effort to aggregate
    data from 2,500 New York City households in all five boroughs (roughly 10,000
    individuals) whose biology and behavior will be measured using an unprecedented
    array of modalities over 20 years. It will also richly measure environmental conditions
    and events that KHP members experience using a geographic information system database
    of unparalleled scale, currently under construction in New York. In this manner,
    KHP will offer both synoptic and granular views of how human health and behavior
    coevolve over the life cycle and why they evolve differently for different people.
    In turn, we argue that this will allow for new discovery-based scientific approaches,
    rooted in big data analytics, to improving the health and quality of human life,
    particularly in urban contexts.

    deciding how we make these billions of dollars of crucial public investments.

  abstract: "Why do policies and business practices that ignore the moral and generous
    side of human nature often fail?\n \n Should the idea of economic man—the amoral
    and self-interested Homo economicus—determine how we expect people to respond
    to monetary rewards, punishments, and other incentives? Samuel Bowles answers
    with a resounding “no.” Policies that follow from this paradigm, he shows, may
    “crowd out” ethical and generous motives and thus backfire.\n \n But incentives
    per se are not really the culprit. Bowles shows that crowding out occurs when
    the message conveyed by fines and rewards is that self-interest is expected, that
    the employer thinks the workforce is lazy, or that the citizen cannot otherwise
    be trusted to contribute to the public good. Using historical and recent case
    studies as well as behavioral experiments, Bowles shows how well-designed incentives
    can crowd in the civic motives on which good governance depends."

    This volume discusses the importance of adopting entrepreneurial and innovation practices in the public sector, as mechanisms for detecting, dealing with and including citizens’ social needs, with a reflection on positive determination of their quality of life. It focuses on critical reflection and rethinking the articulation between the dimensions of transformation – entrepreneurship and innovation – of New Public Management (NPM). In this way the book contributes to deepening knowledge about the implications of this change in the organizational paradigm of the public sector for citizens’ quality of life, which is treated multi-dimensionally here, including citizens’ well-being, purchasing power, happiness, trust, safety, experience and satisfaction.
     The volume constitutes a reference guide for decision makers, managers and policy makers engaged in the public sector who want to differentiate their performance by fostering entrepreneurial and innovative practices in the scope of public administration that can enhance citizens’ quality of life. This volume is also a reference guide for scholars, policy makers and practitioners interested on public innovation.

  abstract: This special issue of the Social Science Computer Review provides a sample
    of the latest strategies employing large data sets in social media and political
    communication research. The proliferation of information communication technologies,
    social media, and the Internet, alongside the ubiquity of high-performance computing
    and storage technologies, has ushered in the era of computational social science.
    However, in no way does the use of “big data” represent a standardized area of
    inquiry in any field. This article briefly summarizes pressing issues when employing
    big data for political communication research. Major challenges remain to ensure
    the validity and generalizability of findings. Strong theoretical arguments are
    still a central part of conducting meaningful research. In addition, ethical practices
    concerning how data are collected remain an area of open discussion. The article
    surveys studies that offer unique and creative ways to combine methods and introduce
    new tools while at the same time address some solutions to ethical questions.

  abstract: Crowdsourcing allows large-scale and flexible invocation of human input
    for data gathering and analysis, which introduces a new paradigm of data mining
    process. Traditional data mining methods often require the experts in analytic
    domains to annotate the data. However, it is expensive and usually takes a long
    time. Crowdsourcing enables the use of heterogeneous background knowledge from
    volunteers and distributes the annotation process to small portions of efforts
    from different contributions. This paper reviews the state-of-the-arts on the
    crowdsourcing for data mining in recent years. We first review the challenges
    and opportunities of data mining tasks using crowdsourcing, and summarize the
    framework of them. Then we highlight several exemplar works in each component
    of the framework, including question designing, data mining and quality control.
    Finally, we conclude the limitation of crowdsourcing for data mining and suggest
    related areas for future research.

    Smart cities are a new vision for urban development.  They integrate information and communication technology infrastructures – in the domains of artificial intelligence, distributed and cloud computing, and sensor networks – into a city, to facilitate quality of life for its citizens and sustainable growth.  This book explores various concepts for the development of these new technologies (including agent-oriented programming, broadband infrastructures, wireless sensor networks, Internet-based networked applications, open data and open platforms), and how they can provide smart services and enablers in a range of public domains.

    The most significant research, both established and emerging, is brought together to enable academics and practitioners to investigate the possibilities of smart cities, and to generate the knowledge and solutions required to develop and maintain them.

  abstract: What effect does government responsiveness have on political participation?
    Since the 1940s political scientists have used attitudinal measures of perceived
    efficacy to explain participation. More recent work has focused on underlying
    genetic factors that condition citizen engagement. We develop a ‘Calculus of Participation’
    that incorporates objective efficacy – the extent to which an individual’s participation
    actually has an impact – and test the model against behavioral data from FixMyStreet.com
    (n=399,364). We find that a successful first experience using FixMyStreet.com
    (e.g., reporting a pothole and having it fixed) is associated with a 54 percent
    increase in the probability of an individual submit-ting a second report. We also
    show that the experience of government responsiveness to the first report submitted
    has predictive power over all future report submissions. The findings highlight
    the importance of government responsiveness for fostering an active citizenry,
    while demonstrating the value of incidentally collected data to examine participatory
    behavior at the individual level.

    an intermediary between citizens and government. This study evaluates the role
    of public libraries as mediating the relationship between citizens and government
    in support of an open government environment. Using data from a national survey
    of "Library and Technology Use" conducted by PEW Internet in 2015, we test whether
    a citizen's perception of public values provided by public libraries influence
    the likelihood of the citizen's engagement within open-government environment
    contexts. The results signify a significant relationship between certain public
    values provided by public libraries with the propensity of citizens engaging government
    in an online environment. Our findings further indicate that varying public values
    generate different results in regard to the way citizens are stimulated to use
    public libraries to engage with government online. These findings imply that programs
    designed and developed to take into account a variety of values are more likely
    to effectively induce citizen engagement in an open government environment through
    the mediation of public libraries.

    The roles of intermediaries in open data is insu ciently explored; open data intermediaries are often presented as single and simple linkages between open data supply and use. This synthesis research paper o ers a more socially nuanced approach to open data intermediaries using the theoretical framework of Bourdieu’s social model, in particular, his concept of species of capital as informing social interaction. The study is based on the analysis of a sample of cases from the Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing Countries Project (ODDC) project. Data on intermediaries were extracted from the ODDC reports according to a working de nition of an open data intermediary presented in this paper, and with a focus on how intermediaries link actors in an open data
    supply chain. The study found that open data supply chains may comprise multiple intermediaries and that multiple forms of capital may be required to connect the supply and use of open data. Because no single intermediary necessarily has all the capital available to link e ectively to all sources of power in a  eld, multiple intermediaries with complementary con gurations of capital are more likely to connect between power nexuses. This study concludes that consideration needs to be given to the presence of multiple intermediaries in an open data ecosystem, each of whom may possess di erent forms of capital to enable the use and unlock the potential impact of open data.

  abstract: This communication explores the unique challenge of contemporary urban
    problems and the technologies that vendors have to solve them. An acknowledged
    gap exists between widely referenced technologies that city managers utilize to
    optimize scheduled operations and those that reflect the capability of spontaneity
    in search of nuance–laden solutions to problems related to the reflexivity of
    entire systems. With regulation, the first issue type succumbs to rehearsed preparation
    whereas the second hinges on extemporaneous practice. One is susceptible to ready-made
    technology applications while the other requires systemic deconstruction and solution-seeking
    redesign. Research suggests that smart city vendors are expertly configured to
    address the former, but less adept at and even ill-configured to react to and
    address the latter. Departures from status quo responses to systemic problems
    depend on formalizing metrics that enable city monitoring and data collection
    to assess “smart investments”, regardless of the size of the intervention, and
    to anticipate the need for designs that preserve the individuality of urban settings
    as they undergo the transformation to become “smart”.

  abstract: After decades of urban investment dominated by sprawl and outward growth,
    municipal governments in the United States are responsible for the upkeep of urban
    neighborhoods that have not received sufficient resources or maintenance in many
    years. One of city governments' biggest challenges is to revitalize decaying neighborhoods
    given only limited resources. In this paper, we apply data science techniques
    to administrative data to help the City of Memphis, Tennessee improve distressed
    neighborhoods. We develop new methods to efficiently identify homes in need of
    rehabilitation and to predict the impacts of potential investments on neighborhoods.
    Our analyses allow Memphis to design neighborhood-improvement strategies that
    generate greater impacts on communities. Since our work uses data that most US
    cities already collect, our models and methods are highly portable and inexpensive
    to implement. We also discuss the challenges we encountered while analyzing government
    data and deploying our tools, and highlight important steps to improve future
    data-driven efforts in urban policy.

  abstract: In this paper, we examine the challenges that regulators face in our rapidly
    changing world—from keeping up with technical and business model innovations and
    the growth in the number of suppliers of goods and services, to dealing with the
    increasingly digital nature of their constituents and the changing attitudes and
    behaviors of industries and consumers. We then identify opportunities for leaders
    of regulatory agencies to navigate today’s challenging landscape and prepare for
    the future—both in the way they make rules and the way they enforce them. In many
    ways, regulators can harness the very trends that have caused disruption and use
    them as a means to modernize regulatory practices and increase effectiveness.
