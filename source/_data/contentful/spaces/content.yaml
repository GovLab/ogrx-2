  abstract: Crisis mapping has emerged as a method of connecting and empowering citizens
    during emergencies. This article explores the hyperbole behind crisis mapping
    as it extends into more long-term or ‘chronic’ community development practices.
    We critically examined developer issues and participant (i.e. community organization)
    usage within the context of local communities. We repurposed the predominant crisis
    mapping platform Crowdmap for three cases of community development in Canadian
    anglophone and francophone. Our case studies show mixed results about the actual
    cost of deployment, the results of disintermediation, and local context with the
    mapping application. Lastly, we discuss the relationship of hype, temporality,
    and community development as expressed in our cases.

  abstract: Billions of dollars have been spent on participatory development programs
    in the developing world. These programs give community members an active decision-making
    role. Given the emphasis on community involvement, one might expect that the effectiveness
    of this approach would depend on communities' pre-existing social capital stocks.
    Using data from a large randomised field experiment of Community-Led Total Sanitation
    in Indonesia, we find that villages with high initial social capital built toilets
    and reduced open defecation, resulting in substantial health benefits. In villages
    with low initial stocks of social capital, the approach was counterproductive
    – fewer toilets were built than in control communities and social capital suffered.

  abstract: "\"The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) has been sold
    by its advocates as a badly needed way to enhance access to information in the
    extractive industries sector and improve government accountability. It has also
    been lauded as enabling energy companies to demonstrate their responsibility and
    sustainability, enabling countries to attract more foreign investment, and enabling
    communities to engage in dialogue with national planners over energy issues. In
    this paper, we ask: does it work? Do countries adhering to EITI standards actually
    see selected governance metrics improve? To answer this question, this article
    first briefly summarizes the history of the EITI and details the hypothetical
    benefits espoused by its supporters. It then proceeds to “test” these benefits
    by qualitatively assessing the performance of EITI for the first two countries
    to achieve candidacy, Azerbaijan and Liberia. The paper finds that while the EITI
    affirms the salience of reliable information and data about the extractive industries,
    it is difficult to attribute governance improvements casually to the EITI. Moreover,
    the EITI reveals an inherent paradox about the virtues of transparency and also
    underscores that much of the damage from mining and hydrocarbon development is
    socially and economically unavoidable. \n\nDoes transparency matter? Evaluating

  abstract: 'Policy makers can use four different modes of governance: ‘hierarchy’,
    ‘markets’, ‘networks’ and ‘persuasion’. In this article, it is argued that ‘nudging’
    represents a distinct (fifth) mode of governance. The effectiveness of nudging
    as a means of bringing about lasting behaviour change is questioned and it is
    argued that evidence for its success ignores the facts that many successful nudges
    are not in fact nudges; that there are instances when nudges backfire; and that
    there may be ethical concerns associated with nudges. Instead, and in contrast
    to nudging, behaviour change is more likely to be enduring where it involves social
    identity change and norm internalisation. The article concludes by urging public
    policy scholars to engage with the social identity literature on ‘social influence’,
    and the idea that those promoting lasting behaviour change need to engage with
    people not as individual cognitive misers, but as members of groups whose norms
    they internalise and enact.'

  abstract: Smart cities are associated almost exclusively with modern technology
    and infrastructure. However, smart cities have the possibility to enhance the
    involvement and contribution of citizens to urban development. This work explores
    the role of governance as one of the factors influencing the participation of
    citizens in smart cities projects. Governance characteristics play a major role
    in explaining different typologies of citizen participation. Through a focus on
    Amsterdam Smart City program as a specific case study, this research examines
    the characteristics of governance that are present in the overall program and
    within a selected sample of projects, and how they relate to different typologies
    of citizen participation. The analysis and comprehension of governance characteristics
    plays a crucial role both for a better understanding and management of citizen
    participation, especially in complex settings where multiple actors are interacting.

  abstract: This article examines the changing nature of the connection between citizens,
    party members and elites in the creation of party policy through the theoretical
    prism of individualisation. Using qualitative case studies of recent policy-making
    initiatives in the Australian Labor Party and the UK Labour Party, the article
    develops a new model of policy transferal that is not built upon the mass-party
    model of parliamentary politics, but rather upon organisational evolutions such
    as community consultations, online participation and supporters' networks. These
    evolutions, or reforms, typically emphasise the individuality of policy-making
    and accountability, promote new technologies for facilitating decision-making,
    and attempt to engage with a new style of politically active citizen. Each of
    these developments carries implications for how political parties facilitate participation,
    accountability and responsiveness in modern forms of representative democracy.

  abstract: This article makes three related arguments. First, that although many
    definitions of the smart city have been proposed, corporate promoters say a smart
    city uses information technology to pursue efficient systems through real-time
    monitoring and control. Second, this definition is not new and equivalent to the
    idea of urban cybernetics debated in the 1970s. Third, drawing on a discussion
    of Rio de Janeiro’s Operations Center, I argue that viewing urban problems as
    wicked problems allows for more fundamental solutions than urban cybernetics,
    but requires local innovation and stakeholder participation. Therefore the last
    section describes institutions for municipal innovation and IT-enabled collaborative
    planning.
