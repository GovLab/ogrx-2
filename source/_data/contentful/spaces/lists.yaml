  title: Selected Readings on Policy Informatics
  author:
  - Erik Johnston
  affiliation:
  - Center for Policy Informatics
  description: "Policy informatics is the transdisciplinary study and application
    of how computation and communication technology leverages information to better
    understand and address complex public policy and administration problems and realize
    innovations in governance processes and institutions. Rapid advancements in information,
    computation, and communication technology continue to proliferate society and
    become increasingly embedded in our everyday activities, transforming how we learn,
    communicate, coordinate, organize, produce, consume, and govern. As the world
    becomes increasingly complex, interconnected, dynamic, and resource-constrained,
    so do the public issues with which we must grapple. In an information-intensive
    governance environment, advancements in information, computation, and communication
    technology afford us the possibility to better tackle complex public issues in
    new and innovative ways that tap into and reflect the reality of this world. In
    particular, this involves liberating data, cultivating the bottom-up generation
    of data and ideas, modeling and simulating system dynamics of coupled human-environmental
    interactions, as well as engaging, educating, and empowering public officials,
    future researchers, and the public-at-large to interact with data and one another
    in a manner that collectively produces meaningful insights, solutions, and actions
    to address public issues.\n\nThe following reading materials are useful for scholars
    and practitioners to understand policy informatics theoretically and practically
    and to apply it in diverse social and policy contexts. Most of the readings were
    selected because in addition to a theoretical contribution, they regularly are
    situated in useful applications across many contexts including health, education,
    and the environment. The readings range from motivating the urgency behind a formal
    study of policy informatics, to highlighting advances in analytics including simulation
    and computational analytics, to design recommendations of the open organizational
    implications of a increasingly connected public through crowdsourcing, participatory
    platforms, and citizen science, to emerging ethical considerations including the
    digitally invisible and algorithmic biases. \n"

    abstract: Public policy and management problems have been described as poorly
      defined, messy, squishy, unstructured, intractable, and wicked. In a word, they
      are complex. This book illustrates the development and use of simulation models
      designed to capture some of the complexity inherent in the formulation, management,
      and implementation of policies aimed at addressing such problems. Simulation
      models have long existed at the fringes of policy inquiry but are not yet considered
      an essential component of the policy analyst’s toolkit. However, this situation
      is likely to change because with improvements in computational power and software,
      simulation is now easier to include in the standard repertoire of research tools
      available for discovery and decision support. This volume provides both a conceptual
      rationale for using simulations to inform public policy and a practical introduction
      to how such models might be constructed and employed. The focus of these papers
      is on the uses of simulation to gain understanding and inform policy decisions
      and action. Techniques represented in this volume include Monte Carlo simulation,
      system dynamics and agent based modeling.

    abstract: Why does Procter & Gamble repeatedly call on enthusiastic amateurs to
      solve scientific and technical challenges? How can companies as diverse as iStockphoto
      and Threadless employ just a handful of people, yet generate millions of dollars
      in revenue every year? "Crowdsourcing" is how the power of the many can be leveraged
      to accomplish feats that were once the responsibility of a specialized few.
      Jeff Howe reveals that the crowd is more than wise–it’s talented, creative,
      and stunningly productive. It’s also a perfect meritocracy, where age, gender,
      race, education, and job history no longer matter; the quality of the work is
      all that counts. If you can perform the service, design the product, or solve
      the problem, you’ve got the job.But crowdsourcing has also triggered a dramatic
      shift in the way work is organized, talent is employed, research is conducted,
      and products are made and marketed. As the crowd comes to supplant traditional
      forms of labor, pain and disruption are inevitable, and Howe delves into both
      the positive and negative consequences of this intriguing phenomenon. Through
      extensive reporting from the front lines of this workplace revolution, he employs
      a brilliant array of stories to look at the economic, cultural, business, and
      political implications of crowdsourcing.

    abstract: A governance infrastructure is the collection of technologies and systems,
      people, policies, practices, and relationships that interact to support governing
      activities. Information technology, especially communication and computational
      technologies, continues to augment society’s ability to organize, interact,
      and govern. As we think about the future of governance, this article challenges
      us to move beyond questions of how to best manage government institutions to
      how to design smart governance systems with the appropriate incentives and rules
      to harness and coordinate the enthusiasm and capabilities of those governed.
      This article anticipates how the interaction of technology and society can be
      leveraged to mindfully design an interaction-defined, participation-based governance
      infrastructure to return power to the people while increasing accountability.
      Supporting examples of such governance approaches already exist and are regularly
      emerging in distributed organizations, online communities, nonprofits, and governments.

    abstract: Policy informatics is addressing governance challenges and their consequences,
      which span the seeming inability of governments to solve complex problems and
      the disaffection of people from their governments. Policy informatics seeks
      approaches that enable our governance systems to address increasingly complex
      challenges and to meet the rising expectations of people to be full participants
      in their communities. This book approaches these challenges by applying a combination
      of the latest American and European approaches in applying complex systems modeling,
      crowdsourcing, participatory platforms and citizen science to explore complex
      governance challenges in domains that include education, environment, and health.

    abstract: This chapter provides design lessons on how to take advantage of advances
      in information technologies that have enabled new governance infrastructures
      to become both possible and desirable. A governance infrastructure is the collection
      of technologies, people, policies, practices, resources, social norms, and information
      that interact to support governing activities. Smart governance infrastructures
      augment society's ability to organize, interact, and govern. Novel instances
      of smart governance infrastructures already exist and are regularly emerging
      in distributed organizations and online communities. As we think about rebooting

      of how to best manage government institutions to questions of how to design
      governance systems with the appropriate incentives and rules to harness and
      coordinate the diversity, enthusiasm, and capabilities of those governed. We
      provide several design lessons learned from successful governance infrastructures
      and propose how they can be applied to address national priorities. This chapter
      anticipates how the interaction of technology and society can be leveraged to
      mindfully design problem-defined, participation-based governance infrastructures
      to return power to the people while increasing accountability and efficiency.

    abstract: The need for a fresh approach to U.S. communities is more urgent than
      ever because of the biggest global economic crisis since the Great Depression.
      Through examination of the barriers to solving urban problems (and the ways
      they reinforce each other), this paper offers a new approach to community transformation
      which calls for leaders to use technology to inform and connect people. We need
      to convert the social safety net into a social safety network through the creation
      of smarter communities that are information-rich, interconnected, and able to
      provide opportunities to all citizens. This process has already begun through
      such programs as Harlem Children's Zone, Baltimore's CitiStat, Elevate Miami,
      and others. And they can be replicated. But technology alone is not the answer.
      Realization of the vision requires leaders to invest in the tools, guide their
      use, and pave the way for transformation. Perhaps the urgency of the current
      economic crisis can provide the impetus to overcome resistance to change and
      turn problems into an opportunity to reduce costs, improve services to communities,
      and make our cities smarter.

    abstract: A recent New York law requires medical providers to offer HIV tests
      as part of routine care. We developed a system dynamics simulation model of
      the HIV testing and care system to help administrators understand the law's
      potential epidemic impact, resource needs, strategies to improve implementation,
      and appropriate outcome indicators for future policy evaluations once postlaw
      data become available. Policy modeling allowed us to synthesize information
      from numerous sources including quantitative administrative data sets and practitioners'
      content expertise, structure the information to be viewed both numerically and
      visually, and organize consensus for decisionmaking purposes. This case illustrates
      how policy modeling can provide an integrated framework for administrators to
      examine policy problems in complex systems, particularly when data time lags
      limit pre--post comparisons and key outcomes cannot be measured directly.

    abstract: 'The book comprehensively debunks the myth of a lumbering, bureaucratic
      state versus a dynamic, innovative private sector. In a series of case studies—from
      IT, biotech, nanotech to today’s emerging green tech—Professor Mazzucato shows
      that the opposite is true: the private sector only finds the courage to invest
      after an entrepreneurial state has made the high-risk investments. In an intensely
      researched chapter, she reveals that every technology that makes the iPhone
      so ‘smart’ was government funded: the Internet, GPS, its touch-screen display
      and the voice-activated Siri. Mazzucato also controversially argues that in
      the history of modern capitalism the State has not only fixed market failures,
      but has also actively shaped and created markets. In doing so, it sometimes
      wins and sometimes fails. Yet by not admitting the State’s role in such active
      risk taking, and pretending that the state only cheers on the side-lines while
      the private sector roars, we have ended up creating an ‘innovation system’ whereby
      the public sector socializes risks, while rewards are privatized. The book considers
      how to change this dysfunctional dynamic so that economic growth can be not
      only ‘smart’ but also ‘inclusive’.'

    abstract: Government “of the people, by the people, for the people” expresses
      an ideal that resonates in all democracies. Yet poll after poll reveals deep
      distrust of institutions that seem to have left “the people” out of the governing
      equation. Government bureaucracies that are supposed to solve critical problems
      on their own are a troublesome outgrowth of the professionalization of public
      life in the industrial age. They are especially ill-suited to confronting today’s
      complex challenges. Offering a far-reaching program for innovation, Smart Citizens,
      Smarter State suggests that public decisionmaking could be more effective and
      legitimate if government were smarter—if our institutions knew how to use technology
      to leverage citizens’ expertise. Just as individuals use only part of their
      brainpower to solve most problems, governing institutions make far too little
      use of the skills and experience of those inside and outside of government with
      scientific credentials, practical skills, and ground-level street smarts. New
      tools—what Beth Simone Noveck calls technologies of expertise—are making it
      possible to match the supply of citizen expertise to the demand for it in government.
      Drawing on a wide range of academic disciplines and practical examples from
      her work as an adviser to governments on institutional innovation, Noveck explores
      how to create more open and collaborative institutions. In so doing, she puts
      forward a profound new vision for participatory democracy rooted not in the
      paltry act of occasional voting or the serendipity of crowdsourcing but in people’s
      knowledge and know-how.

    abstract: Every day, corporations are connecting the dots about our personal behavior—silently
      scrutinizing clues left behind by our work habits and Internet use. The data
      compiled and portraits created are incredibly detailed, to the point of being
      invasive. But who connects the dots about what firms are doing with this information?
      The Black Box Society argues that we all need to be able to do so—and to set
      limits on how big data affects our lives. Hidden algorithms can make (or ruin)
      reputations, decide the destiny of entrepreneurs, or even devastate an entire
      economy. Shrouded in secrecy and complexity, decisions at major Silicon Valley
      and Wall Street firms were long assumed to be neutral and technical. But leaks,
      whistleblowers, and legal disputes have shed new light on automated judgment.
      Self-serving and reckless behavior is surprisingly common, and easy to hide
      in code protected by legal and real secrecy. Even after billions of dollars
      of fines have been levied, underfunded regulators may have only scratched the
      surface of this troubling behavior. Frank Pasquale exposes how powerful interests
      abuse secrecy for profit and explains ways to rein them in. Demanding transparency
      is only the first step. An intelligible society would assure that key decisions
      of its most important firms are fair, nondiscriminatory, and open to criticism.
      Silicon Valley and Wall Street need to accept as much accountability as they
      impose on others.

      readers with a much-needed primer for the digital age. Now, with Cognitive Surplus,
      he reveals how new digital technology is unleashing a torrent of creative production
      that will transform our world. For the first time, people are embracing new
      media that allow them to pool their efforts at vanishingly low cost. The results
      of this aggregated effort range from mind-expanding reference tools like Wikipedia
      to life-saving Web sites like Ushahidi.com, which allows Kenyans to report acts
      of violence in real time. Cognitive Surplus explores what's possible when people
      unite to use their intellect, energy, and time for the greater good.

    abstract: Public  organizations  have  interacted  with  citizens  through increasingly  sophisticated  internet-enabled  technology.  Participatory
      platforms  emerged  from  Web  2.0  technologies  in  the  mid-2000s  as  a
      governance mechanism to  engage  citizens in the process of  effecting  social
      change.  Although  the  potential  of  platforms  is  recognized,  its  successful
      implementation has faced challenges. To begin to get a handle on how to best
      design  and  manage  participatory  platforms,  we  conducted  an  exploratory
      participatory  action  research  study  grounded  in  two  events  –  The  Policy
      Challenge and NSF Workshop on Participatory Platforms with a Public Intent.
      Both events  communed  practitioners,  scholars,  and citizen participants with
      diverse experience and expertise conducting and researching platforms. The insights  expressed  through  the
      events  and  follow-up  interviews  and  online survey  informed  our  development  of  a  participatory  platform  lifecycle  and
      design framework to assist designing successful participatory platforms.

  title: Selected Readings on Civic Technology
  author:
  - Rebecca Rumbul
  affiliation:
  - mySociety
  description: "mySociety’s vision is for citizens around the world to feel empowered
    to interact efficiently, effectively and meaningfully with their governments and
    decision-makers using low cost and user-friendly civic technology. We want to
    enable citizens to communicate through accessible means, to solve their problems
    and to get what they are entitled to from institutions.\n\nWe believe that strong
    democratic accountability and a thriving civil society are vital to our common
    welfare, and that these cannot survive where people do not engage with government
    and communities. We work online because we believe that the internet can meaningfully
    lower the barriers to taking the first civic or democratic steps in a citizen’s
    life, and that it can do so at scale.\n\nThese selected readings on civic technology
    reflect this vision and greatly improve our understanding of how and why civic
    tech is having an impact. \n\n__EVALUATING DIGITAL CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT : A PRACTICAL
    GUIDE\n__\n*World Bank Group (2015)*\nWhenever I speak to someone that’s just
    getting started in the civic tech world, this is the first report I suggest they
    read. Its primarily aimed at practitioners rather than researchers, but it’s a
    wonderful introduction to the key concepts, the challenges, the language and the
    global landscape of civic tech. This report was informed by a lot of the main
    stakeholders in civic tech, and includes great examples of the work that’s happening,
    and the tasks associated with increasing and measuring digital civic engagement.
    Civic tech is maturing as a field, and this report provides much encouraging inspiration
    in analysing the real-world impacts of civic technologies, going beyond primitive
    measurements to discuss meaningful methods.\n \n__THE PROBLEM OF CITIZENS: E-DEMOCRACY
    FOR ACTUALLY EXISTING DEMOCRACY__\n*Kreiss (2015)*\nThis is an incredibly thoughtful
    article that considers e-democracy initiatives to be fundamentally flawed in their
    designs, and based on flawed assumptions about users being impartial and non-partisan.
    It argues against generalising users of civic tech into a homogenous group, and
    proposes that citizens be encouraged to deliberate and collaborate both within
    and between partisan groupings in order to enhance understanding. Whilst I find
    many of the suggestions in this paper impractical or unrealistic, and I do not
    necessarily agree with the author on several points, the reason I enjoy it so
    much is because it challenges assumptions that tend to be embedded into the civic
    tech sphere, and prompts me to think about civic tech solutions in a different
    way. In any field, there can be a tendency towards institutionalisation, and this
    paper pushes against those boundaries with some very interesting arguments. \n
    \n \n__\"I WLD LIKE U WMP TO EXTEND ELECTRICITY 2 OUR VILLAGE\": ON INFORMATION
    TECHNOLOGY AND INTEREST ARTICULATION__ \n*Grossman, Humphreys & Saramone-Lutz
    (2014)*\nIn a world where aid and development agencies, as well as philanthropists
    and civil society, are promoting the transformative potential of the internet
    in increasing civic engagement, this piece of research provides an incredibly
    valuable insight into how individuals in developing countries are actually using
    civic tech. A key risk in the research of civic tech is in drawing conclusions
    based upon distinct or unrepresentative constituencies, and this research team
    went to great lengths to conduct a high quality and well targeted analysis of
    the low-income and marginalised individuals that are of significant interest to
    the development community. This is an important piece of literature that I take
    inspiration from when designing my own research projects. \n \n__WHO BENEFITS
    FROM CIVIC TECH?__\n*mySociety (2015)*\nIt seems a little narcissistic to cite
    a report produced by my own organisation, but its a report that provides some
    useful insights into the users of civic tech, and how they feel about the tools
    that they are using. It is again, something of a starting point for people who
    are just entering the world of civic tech, and provides an overview not just of
    demographics, but of public attitudes. The great thing about this report is its
    comparative aspect, looking at both developed countries and developing countries,
    and whilst it makes for uncomfortable reading in places (identifying the gender,
    age and educational imbalances in the user bases), it also provides encouraging
    data concerning users self-reported empowerment. \n \n__WHEN DOES ICT-ENABLED
    CITIZEN VOICE LEAD TO GOVERNMENT RESPONSIVENESS?__\n*Peixoto & Fox (2016)* \nThis
    is a really important piece of research examining one of the most critical aspects
    of e-democracy technologies; the responsiveness of governments. Civic technologists
    can build the most beautifully crafted and user friendly platforms in the world,
    but if politicians or bureaucrats are unwilling or unable to be responsive to
    the issues raised by the platforms, then failure is inevitable, and the consequence
    is a disillusioned public. This research unfortunately does not provide a very
    encouraging picture of current institutional behaviours, however is inspirational
    and thought-provoking for civic technologists in identifying a key issue that
    requires an innovative solution. "

      With growing demand for transparency, accountability and citizen participation in
       policy making and service provision, engagement between citizens and their governments,
       as well as with donors and the private sector that deliver government
       services, is increasingly important. Increased use of technology brings both opportunities
       and challenges to citizen engagement processes, including opportunities
       for collecting, analyzing and evaluating data about these processes. This guide provides
       practical steps to assess the extent to which digital tools have contributed to
       citizen engagement and the help to understand the impact that the introduction of
       technology has had on the engagement processes. With examples and lessons from case studies from Brazil, Uganda, Cameroon and
       Kenya, the guide provides practical tools and guidelines for use in evaluating the
       expanding field of digital citizen engagement.

    abstract: 'How does access to information communication technology (ICT) affect
      who gets heard and what gets communicated to politicians? On the one hand, ICT
      can lower communication costs for poorer constituents; on the other, technological
      channels may be used disproportionately more by the already well connected.
      To assess the flattening effects of ICTs, we presented a representative sample
      of constituents in Uganda with an opportunity to send a text message to their
      representatives at one of three randomly assigned prices. Critically, and contrary
      to concerns that technological innovations benefit the privileged, we find evidence
      that ICT can lead to significant flattening: a greater share of marginalized
      populations use this channel compared to existing political communication channels.
      Price plays a more complex role. Subsidizing the full cost of messaging increases
      uptake by over 40%. Surprisingly however, subsidy-induced increases in uptake
      do not yield further flattening since free channels are not used at higher rates
      by more marginalized constituents.'

    abstract: |
      This paper reviews evidence on the use of 23 information and communication technology (ICT) platforms
       to project citizen voice to improve public service delivery. This meta-analysis focuses on empirical studies
       of initiatives in the global South, highlighting both citizen uptake (‘yelp’) and the degree to which public
       service providers respond to expressions of citizen voice (‘teeth’). The conceptual framework further distinguishes
       between two trajectories for ICT-enabled citizen voice: Upwards accountability occurs when users
       provide feedback directly to decision-makers in real time, allowing policy-makers and program managers
       to identify and address service delivery problems – but at their discretion. Downwards accountability, in
       contrast, occurs either through real time user feedback or less immediate forms of collective civic action
       that publicly call on service providers to become more accountable and depends less exclusively on decision-
       makers’ discretion about whether or not to act on the information provided. This distinction between
       the ways in which ICT platforms mediate the relationship between citizens and service providers allows for
       a precise analytical focus on how different dimensions of such platforms contribute to public sector responsiveness.
       These cases suggest that while ICT platforms have been relevant in increasing policymakers’
       and senior managers’ capacity to respond, most of them have yet to influence their willingness to do so.

    abstract: 'This article argues that many contemporary e-democracy projects, particularly
      in the United States, have at their heart a model of atomistic, independent,
      rational, and general-interest citizens. As such, these projects, variously
      grouped under the labels of e-governance, online deliberation, open government,
      and civic technology, often assume a broad shared consensus about collective
      definitions of “public problems” that both does not exist and sidesteps debates
      over what these problems are and what potential solutions can and should be.
      Drawing on recent theories of political parties, social identity, and cultural
      cognition, this article argues that e-democracy efforts need to account for
      the fact that the citizens practitioners appeal to see themselves by default
      as members of social groups, and that this has implications for politics and
      what Jasanoff calls “civic epistemology.” Presenting the case of attempting
      to change Republican opinions about climate change, I argue that e-democracy
      initiatives should seek to foster collaboration and deliberation within, not
      between, parties and among partisans. To do so, e-democratic reformers need
      to explicitly structure the collaborative and deliberative environment so there
      is a range of intra-party opinions and beliefs as part of the consultative and
      policy-making process.
