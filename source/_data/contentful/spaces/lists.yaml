  title: Selected Readings on Civic Technology

  description: "mySociety’s vision is for citizens around the world to feel empowered
    to interact efficiently, effectively and meaningfully with their governments and
    decision-makers using low cost and user-friendly civic technology. We want to
    enable citizens to communicate through accessible means, to solve their problems
    and to get what they are entitled to from institutions.\n\nWe believe that strong
    democratic accountability and a thriving civil society are vital to our common
    welfare, and that these cannot survive where people do not engage with government
    and communities. We work online because we believe that the internet can meaningfully
    lower the barriers to taking the first civic or democratic steps in a citizen’s
    life, and that it can do so at scale.\n\nThese selected readings on civic technology
    reflect this vision and greatly improve our understanding of how and why civic
    tech is having an impact. \n\n__EVALUATING DIGITAL CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT : A PRACTICAL
    GUIDE\n__\n*World Bank Group (2015)*\nWhenever I speak to someone that’s just
    getting started in the civic tech world, this is the first report I suggest they
    read. Its primarily aimed at practitioners rather than researchers, but it’s a
    wonderful introduction to the key concepts, the challenges, the language and the
    global landscape of civic tech. This report was informed by a lot of the main
    stakeholders in civic tech, and includes great examples of the work that’s happening,
    and the tasks associated with increasing and measuring digital civic engagement.
    Civic tech is maturing as a field, and this report provides much encouraging inspiration
    in analysing the real-world impacts of civic technologies, going beyond primitive
    measurements to discuss meaningful methods.\n \n__THE PROBLEM OF CITIZENS: E-DEMOCRACY
    FOR ACTUALLY EXISTING DEMOCRACY__\n*Kreiss (2015)*\nThis is an incredibly thoughtful
    article that considers e-democracy initiatives to be fundamentally flawed in their
    designs, and based on flawed assumptions about users being impartial and non-partisan.
    It argues against generalising users of civic tech into a homogenous group, and
    proposes that citizens be encouraged to deliberate and collaborate both within
    and between partisan groupings in order to enhance understanding. Whilst I find
    many of the suggestions in this paper impractical or unrealistic, and I do not
    necessarily agree with the author on several points, the reason I enjoy it so
    much is because it challenges assumptions that tend to be embedded into the civic
    tech sphere, and prompts me to think about civic tech solutions in a different
    way. In any field, there can be a tendency towards institutionalisation, and this
    paper pushes against those boundaries with some very interesting arguments. \n
    \n \n__\"I WLD LIKE U WMP TO EXTEND ELECTRICITY 2 OUR VILLAGE\": ON INFORMATION
    TECHNOLOGY AND INTEREST ARTICULATION__ \n*Grossman, Humphreys & Saramone-Lutz
    (2014)*\nIn a world where aid and development agencies, as well as philanthropists
    and civil society, are promoting the transformative potential of the internet
    in increasing civic engagement, this piece of research provides an incredibly
    valuable insight into how individuals in developing countries are actually using
    civic tech. A key risk in the research of civic tech is in drawing conclusions
    based upon distinct or unrepresentative constituencies, and this research team
    went to great lengths to conduct a high quality and well targeted analysis of
    the low-income and marginalised individuals that are of significant interest to
    the development community. This is an important piece of literature that I take
    inspiration from when designing my own research projects. \n \n__WHO BENEFITS
    FROM CIVIC TECH?__\n*mySociety (2015)*\nIt seems a little narcissistic to cite
    a report produced by my own organisation, but its a report that provides some
    useful insights into the users of civic tech, and how they feel about the tools
    that they are using. It is again, something of a starting point for people who
    are just entering the world of civic tech, and provides an overview not just of
    demographics, but of public attitudes. The great thing about this report is its
    comparative aspect, looking at both developed countries and developing countries,
    and whilst it makes for uncomfortable reading in places (identifying the gender,
    age and educational imbalances in the user bases), it also provides encouraging
    data concerning users self-reported empowerment. \n \n__WHEN DOES ICT-ENABLED
    CITIZEN VOICE LEAD TO GOVERNMENT RESPONSIVENESS?__\n*Peixoto & Fox (2016)* \nThis
    is a really important piece of research examining one of the most critical aspects
    of e-democracy technologies; the responsiveness of governments. Civic technologists
    can build the most beautifully crafted and user friendly platforms in the world,
    but if politicians or bureaucrats are unwilling or unable to be responsive to
    the issues raised by the platforms, then failure is inevitable, and the consequence
    is a disillusioned public. This research unfortunately does not provide a very
    encouraging picture of current institutional behaviours, however is inspirational
    and thought-provoking for civic technologists in identifying a key issue that
    requires an innovative solution. "

      With growing demand for transparency, accountability and citizen participation in
       policy making and service provision, engagement between citizens and their governments,
       as well as with donors and the private sector that deliver government
       services, is increasingly important. Increased use of technology brings both opportunities
       and challenges to citizen engagement processes, including opportunities
       for collecting, analyzing and evaluating data about these processes. This guide provides
       practical steps to assess the extent to which digital tools have contributed to
       citizen engagement and the help to understand the impact that the introduction of
       technology has had on the engagement processes. With examples and lessons from case studies from Brazil, Uganda, Cameroon and
       Kenya, the guide provides practical tools and guidelines for use in evaluating the
       expanding field of digital citizen engagement.

    abstract: 'How does access to information communication technology (ICT) affect
      who gets heard and what gets communicated to politicians? On the one hand, ICT
      can lower communication costs for poorer constituents; on the other, technological
      channels may be used disproportionately more by the already well connected.
      To assess the flattening effects of ICTs, we presented a representative sample
      of constituents in Uganda with an opportunity to send a text message to their
      representatives at one of three randomly assigned prices. Critically, and contrary
      to concerns that technological innovations benefit the privileged, we find evidence
      that ICT can lead to significant flattening: a greater share of marginalized
      populations use this channel compared to existing political communication channels.
      Price plays a more complex role. Subsidizing the full cost of messaging increases
      uptake by over 40%. Surprisingly however, subsidy-induced increases in uptake
      do not yield further flattening since free channels are not used at higher rates
      by more marginalized constituents.'

    abstract: |
      This paper reviews evidence on the use of 23 information and communication technology (ICT) platforms
       to project citizen voice to improve public service delivery. This meta-analysis focuses on empirical studies
       of initiatives in the global South, highlighting both citizen uptake (‘yelp’) and the degree to which public
       service providers respond to expressions of citizen voice (‘teeth’). The conceptual framework further distinguishes
       between two trajectories for ICT-enabled citizen voice: Upwards accountability occurs when users
       provide feedback directly to decision-makers in real time, allowing policy-makers and program managers
       to identify and address service delivery problems – but at their discretion. Downwards accountability, in
       contrast, occurs either through real time user feedback or less immediate forms of collective civic action
       that publicly call on service providers to become more accountable and depends less exclusively on decision-
       makers’ discretion about whether or not to act on the information provided. This distinction between
       the ways in which ICT platforms mediate the relationship between citizens and service providers allows for
       a precise analytical focus on how different dimensions of such platforms contribute to public sector responsiveness.
       These cases suggest that while ICT platforms have been relevant in increasing policymakers’
       and senior managers’ capacity to respond, most of them have yet to influence their willingness to do so.
