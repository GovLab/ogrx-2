  title: Selected Readings on Collective Intelligence
  author:
  - Geoff Mulgan
  affiliation:

  description: "Collective intelligence is a newish term for an old topic. It describes
    how intelligence functions at large scales: how teams or meetings do or don’t
    make the most of their members, through to how whole societies solve problems.
    \ The phrase was first used in the 19th century but has been given much greater
    prominence recently thanks to the spread of digital tools. There’s relatively
    little literature on collective intelligence as such, but there is a very broad
    literature of related topics, from philosophical speculation about how the Internet
    could change the way humanity thinks to social psychology, computer science to
    economics. This reflects the fact that there isn’t yet a coherent discipline of
    collective intelligence. But over the next few decades there’s a good prospect
    that one will emerge, synthesising insights from across a range of disciplines,
    and in particular showing how the combination of human and machine intelligence
    can help groups think and act more successfully.\n\nThe following readings give
    a flavour of the range. They include some very broad sweeps (such as the books
    by Pierre Levy and Howard Bloom); a collection from Thomas Malone and Michael
    Bernstein which aims to map the state of the field, including the contributions
    of various social science disciplines; a recent collection from the foremost contemporary
    author on individual intelligence (Robert Sternberg); and a very different collection
    focused more on democracy and public decision-making (Helene Landemore and Jon
    Elster). \n\nThe piece by Anita Woolley et al is a good example of a specific
    experiment which showed some of the characteristics that make a group better at
    solving problems. Cass Sunstein’s book is a very readable guide to group decision
    making, which reaffirms the principle that it’s often sensible to get a group
    to agree on diagnosis before moving onto prescription. Simon Hartley’s book on
    teams is a good example of the huge literature on what makes teams work – whether
    in sports or business.   Michael Nielsen’s book is a fascinating account of how
    science is being transformed by the Internet and new ways of mobilising many minds
    to solve problems. Finally, I’ve also added on a link to a short paper I wrote
    on what’s known about making meetings successful – which shows why the vast majority
    of meetings in academic, business and politics are so unsuccessful in making the
    most of the brainpower of their participants.\n"

    abstract: The number of travelers along the information superhighway is increasing
      at a rate of 10 percent a month. How will this communications revolution affect
      our culture and society? Pierre Lévy shows how the unfettered exchange of ideas
      in cyberspace has the potential to liberate us from the social and political
      hierarchies that have stood in the way of mankind's advancement. Anthropologist,
      historian, sociologist, and philosopher, Lévy writes with a depth of scholarship
      and imaginative insight rare among media critics. At once a profound historical
      analysis of the development of human culture and a blueprint for the future,
      Collective Intelligence is a visionary work.

    abstract: |-
      In this extraordinary follow-up to the critically acclaimed The Lucifer Principle, Howard Bloom-one of today's preeminent thinkers-offers us a bold rewrite of the evolutionary saga. He shows how plants and animals (including humans) have evolved together as components of a worldwide learning machine. He describes the network of life on Earth as one that is, in fact, a ""complex adaptive system,"" a global brain in which each of us plays a sometimes conscious, sometimes unknowing role. and he reveals that the World Wide Web is just the latest step in the development of this brain. These are theories as important as they are radical. Informed by twenty years of interdisciplinary research, Bloom takes us on a spellbinding journey back to the big bang to let us see how its fires forged primordial sociality. As he brings us back via surprising routes, we see how our earliest bacterial ancestors built multitrillion-member research and development teams a full 3.5 billion years ago. We watch him unravel the previously unrecognized strands of interconnectedness woven by crowds of trilobites, hunting packs of dinosaurs, feathered flying lizards gathered in flocks, troops of baboons making communal decisions, and adventurous tribes of protohumans spreading across continents but still linked by primitive forms of information networking. We soon find ourselves reconsidering our place in the world. Along the way, Bloom offers us exhilarating insights into the strange tricks of body and mind that have organized a variety of life forms: spiny lobsters, which, during the Paleozoic age, participated in communal marching rituals; and bees, which, during the age of dinosaurs, conducted collective brainwork. This fascinating tour continues on to the sometimes brutal subculture wars that have spurred the growth of human civilization since the Stone Age. Bloom shows us how culture shapes our infant brains, immersing us in a matrix of truth and mass delusion that we think of as reality.

      Global Brain is more than just a brilliantly original contribution to the ongoing debate on the inner workings of evolution. It is a ""grand vision,"" says the eminent evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson, a work that transforms our very view of who we are and why.

    abstract: "Intelligence does not arise only in individual brains; it also arises
      in groups of individuals. This is collective intelligence: groups of individuals
      acting collectively in ways that seem intelligent. In recent years, a new kind
      of collective intelligence has emerged: interconnected groups of people and
      computers, collectively doing intelligent things. Today these groups are engaged
      in tasks that range from writing software to predicting the results of presidential
      elections. This volume reports on the latest research in the study of collective
      intelligence, laying out a shared set of research challenges from a variety
      of disciplinary and methodological perspectives. Taken together, these essays—by
      leading researchers from such fields as computer science, biology, economics,
      and psychology—lay the foundation for a new multidisciplinary field. \n\nEach
      essay describes the work on collective intelligence in a particular discipline—for
      example, economics and the study of markets; biology and research on emergent
      behavior in ant colonies; human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence;
      and cognitive psychology and the “wisdom of crowds” effect. Other areas in social
      science covered include social psychology, organizational theory, law, and communications. "

    abstract: Psychologists have repeatedly shown that a single statistical factor—often
      called “general intelligence”—emerges from the correlations among people’s performance
      on a wide variety of cognitive tasks. But no one has systematically examined
      whether a similar kind of “collective intelligence” exists for groups of people.
      In two studies with 699 people, working in groups of two to five, we find converging
      evidence of a general collective intelligence factor that explains a group’s
      performance on a wide variety of tasks. This “c factor” is not strongly correlated
      with the average or maximum individual intelligence of group members but is
      correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality
      in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females
      in the group.

    abstract: James Madison wrote, 'Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every
      Athenian assembly would still have been a mob'. The contributors to this volume
      discuss and for the most part challenge this claim by considering conditions
      under which many minds can be wiser than one. With backgrounds in economics,
      cognitive science, political science, law and history, the authors consider
      information markets, the internet, jury debates, democratic deliberation and
      the use of diversity as mechanisms for improving collective decisions. At the
      same time, they consider voter irrationality and paradoxes of aggregation as
      possibly undermining the wisdom of groups. Implicitly or explicitly, the volume
      also offers guidance and warnings to institutional designers.

    abstract: How can creative individuals and societies adapt to complex 21st-century
      conditions? Will civilizations thrive or collapse in the decades to come if
      they are not creative enough, or if they are too creative? Interest in these
      questions is growing; however, until now there has been inadequate understanding
      of the socioeconomic and cultural trends and issues that influence creativity.
      This book provides that understanding while yielding insights from many of the
      world’s leading creativity researchers and educational experts. The book begins
      with a big-picture, interdisciplinary overview of the socioeconomic, cultural,
      and technological pressures emerging from 21st-century globalization and describes
      some ways in which those pressures simultaneously suppress, distort, and invigorate
      creativity in general, and creative education in particular. After that, prominent
      scholars of creativity and education use their impressive knowledge bases to
      clarify how we can adjust our thoughts and actions in order to give ourselves
      the best possible chances for success in this complex world.

    abstract: |-
      Reasoning is generally seen as a means to improve knowledge and make better decisions. However, much evidence shows that reasoning often leads to epistemic distortions and poor decisions. This suggests that the function of reasoning should be rethought. Our hypothesis is that the function of reasoning is argumentative. It is to devise and evaluate arguments intended to persuade.
      Reasoning so conceived is adaptive given the exceptional dependence of humans on communication and their vulnerability to misinformation. A wide range of evidence in the psychology of reasoning and decision making can be reinterpreted and better explained in the light of this hypothesis. Poor performance in standard reasoning tasks is explained by the lack of argumentative context. When the same problems are placed in a proper argumentative setting, people turn out to be skilled arguers. Skilled
      arguers, however, are not after the truth but after arguments supporting their views. This explains the notorious confirmation bias. This bias is apparent not only when people are actually arguing, but also when they are reasoning proactively from the perspective of having to defend their opinions. Reasoning so motivated can distort evaluations and attitudes and allow erroneous beliefs to persist. Proactively used reasoning also favors decisions that are easy to justify but not necessarily better. In all these instances traditionally described as failures or flaws, reasoning does exactly what can be expected of an argumentative device: Look for arguments that support a given conclusion, and, ceteris paribus, favor conclusions for which arguments can be found.

    abstract: "Since the beginning of human history, people have made decisions in
      groups—first in families and villages, and now as part of companies, governments,
      school boards, religious organizations, or any one of countless other groups.
      And having more than one person to help decide is good because the group benefits
      from the collective knowledge of all of its members, and this results in better
      decisions. Right?\n\nBack to reality. We’ve all been involved in group decisions—and
      they’re hard. And they often turn out badly. Why? Many blame bad decisions on
      “groupthink” without a clear idea of what that term really means. \n\nNow, Nudge
      coauthor Cass Sunstein and leading decision-making scholar Reid Hastie shed
      light on the specifics of why and how group decisions go wrong—and offer tactics
      and lessons to help leaders avoid the pitfalls and reach better outcomes. In
      the first part of the book, they explain in clear and fascinating detail the
      distinct problems groups run into:\n\n•They often amplify, rather than correct,
      individual errors in judgment\n•They fall victim to cascade effects, as members
      follow what others say or do\n•They become polarized, adopting more extreme
      positions than the ones they began with\n•They emphasize what everybody knows
      instead of focusing on critical information that only a few people know\n\nIn
      the second part of the book, the authors turn to straightforward methods and
      advice for making groups smarter. These approaches include silencing the leader
      so that the views of other group members can surface, rethinking rewards and
      incentives to encourage people to reveal their own knowledge, thoughtfully assigning
      roles that are aligned with people’s unique strengths, and more.\n\nWith examples
      from a broad range of organizations—from Google to the CIA—and written in an
      engaging and witty style, Wiser will not only enlighten you; it will help your
      team and your organization make better decisions—decisions that lead to greater
      success."

    abstract: "What do world-class teams do that others don't? How do those teams
      think, make decisions and respond to challenges?\n\nStronger Together will help
      readers to understand what differentiates world-class teams from the rest. Using
      these insights, readers can apply the same key principles when leading - or
      being a part of - a team, whether they are in a business or sports environment.
      \n\nTo illustrate how world-class teams operate and how they're led, the author
      draws on examples of teamwork from a diverse range of disciplines, from The
      Red Arrows to SAS Units, a Formula One Pit Crew, Americas Cup yacht crews, World
      Championship sports teams and more. He includes case studies from his work with
      elite professional, international and Olympic sports teams, plus executive leadership
      teams from businesses.\n\nThis truly insightful and fascinating book lifts the
      lid on what it takes to be the best and how we can translate these lessons to
      our own performance."

      Edwin Hutchins combines his background as an anthropologist and an open ocean racing sailor and navigator in this account of how anthropological methods can be combined with cognitive theory to produce a new reading of cognitive science. His theoretical insights are grounded in an extended analysis of ship navigation—its computational basis, its historical roots, its social organization, and the details of its implementation in actual practice aboard large ships. The result is an unusual interdisciplinary approach to cognition in culturally constituted activities outside the laboratory—"in the wild."

      Hutchins examines a set of phenomena that have fallen in the cracks between the established disciplines of psychology and anthropology, bringing to light a new set of relationships between culture and cognition. The standard view is that culture affects the cognition of individuals. Hutchins argues instead that cultural activity systems have cognitive properties of their own that are different from the cognitive properties of the individuals who participate in them. Each action for bringing a large naval vessel into port, for example, is informed by culture: the navigation team can be seen as a cognitive and computational system.

      Introducing Navy life and work on the bridge, Hutchins makes a clear distinction between the cognitive properties of an individual and the cognitive properties of a system. In striking contrast to the usual laboratory tasks of research in cognitive science, he applies the principal metaphor of cognitive science—cognition as computation (adopting David Marr's paradigm)—to the navigation task. After comparing modern Western navigation with the method practiced in Micronesia, Hutchins explores the computational and cognitive properties of systems that are larger than an individual. He then turns to an analysis of learning or change in the organization of cognitive systems at several scales. Hutchins's conclusion illustrates the costs of ignoring the cultural nature of cognition, pointing to the ways in which contemporary cognitive science can be transformed by new meanings and interpretations.

      In Reinventing Discovery, Michael Nielsen argues that we are living at the dawn of the most dramatic change in science in more than 300 years. This change is being driven by powerful new cognitive tools, enabled by the internet, which are greatly accelerating scientific discovery. There are many books about how the internet is changing business or the workplace or government. But this is the first book about something much more fundamental: how the internet is transforming the nature of our collective intelligence and how we understand the world.

      Reinventing Discovery tells the exciting story of an unprecedented new era of networked science. We learn, for example, how mathematicians in the Polymath Project are spontaneously coming together to collaborate online, tackling and rapidly demolishing previously unsolved problems. We learn how 250,000 amateur astronomers are working together in a project called Galaxy Zoo to understand the large-scale structure of the Universe, and how they are making astonishing discoveries, including an entirely new kind of galaxy. These efforts are just a small part of the larger story told in this book--the story of how scientists are using the internet to dramatically expand our problem-solving ability and increase our combined brainpower.

      This is a book for anyone who wants to understand how the online world is revolutionizing scientific discovery today--and why the revolution is just beginning.

      Many of us spend much of our time in meetings and at conferences. But too often these feel like a waste of time, or fail to make the most of the knowledge and experience of the people present.

      Meetings have changed - with much more use of online tools, and a growing range of different meeting formats. But our sense is that meetings could be much better
      run and achieve better results.

      This paper tries to help. It:
      ● summarises some of what's known about how meetings work well or badly;
      ● makes recommendations about how to make meetings better; and
      ● showcases some interesting recent innovations.

      It forms part of a larger research programme at Nesta on collective intelligence which is investigating how groups and organisations can make the most of their brains, and of the technologies they use.

      We hope the paper will be helpful to anyone designing or running meetings of any kind, and that readers will contribute good examples, ideas and evidence which can be added into future versions.

  title: Selected Readings on Data Collaboratives

  description: |-
    The term data collaborative refers to a new form of collaboration, beyond the public-private partnership model, in which participants from different sectors (including private companies, research institutions, and government agencies) exchange data to create new public value and solve public problems. Several of society’s greatest challenges — from addressing climate change to public health to job creation to improving the lives of children — require greater access to data, more collaboration between public – and private-sector entities, and an increased ability to analyze datasets. In the coming months and years, data collaboratives will be essential vehicles for harnessing the vast stores of privately held data toward the public good.

    The pieces collected here examine a number of elements related to this emerging field – from the potential (or realized) societal benefits of data collaboratives, to issues of governance and incentives for corporations to participate in such arrangements, to risks and strategies for mitigating them.

    abstract: 'Over the past few decades, a new form of governance has emerged to
      replace adversarial and managerial modes of policy making and implementation.
      Collaborative governance, as it has come to be known, brings public and private
      stakeholders together in collective forums with public agencies to engage in
      consensus-oriented decision making. In this article, we conduct a meta-analytical
      study of the existing literature on collaborative governance with the goal of
      elaborating a contingency model of collaborative governance. After reviewing
      137 cases of collaborative governance across a range of policy sectors, we identify
      critical variables that will influence whether or not this mode of governance
      will produce successful collaboration. These variables include the prior history
      of conflict or cooperation, the incentives for stakeholders to participate,
      power and resources imbalances, leadership, and institutional design. We also
      identify a series of factors that are crucial within the collaborative process
      itself. These factors include face-to-face dialogue, trust building, and the
      development of commitment and shared understanding. We found that a virtuous
      cycle of collaboration tends to develop when collaborative forums focus on “small
      wins” that deepen trust, commitment, and shared understanding. The article concludes
      with a discussion of the implications of our contingency model for practitioners
      and for future research on collaborative governance.

    abstract: "Data-driven innovation has great potential for the development of innovative
      services that not only have economic value, but that help to address societal
      challenges. Many of these challenges can only be addressed by data sharing of
      public and privately owned data. These public-private data sharing collaborations
      require data governance rules. Data governance can address many barriers, for
      example by deploying a decision model to guide choices regarding data sharing
      resulting in interventions supported by a data sharing platform. Based on a
      literature review of data governance and three use cases for data sharing in
      the logistics sector, we have developed a data sharing decision model from the
      perspective of a data provider. The decision model addresses technical as well
      as ownership, privacy, and economical barriers to sharing publicly and privately
      owned data and subsequently proposes interventions to address these barriers.
      We found that the decision model is useful for identifying and addressing data
      sharing barriers as it is applicable to amongst others privacy and commercial
      sensitive data.\n\n"

    abstract: "Science-intensive firms are experimenting with ‘open data’ initiatives,
      involving collaboration with academic scientists whereby all results are published
      with no restriction. Firms seeking to benefit from open data face two key challenges:
      revealing R&D problems may leak valuable information to competitors, and academic
      scientists may lack motivation to address problems posed by firms. We explore
      how firms overcome these challenges through an inductive study of the Structural
      Genomics Consortium. We find that the operation of the consortium as a boundary
      organization provided two core mechanisms to address the above challenges. First,
      through mediated revealing, the boundary organization allowed firms to disclose
      R&D problems while minimizing adverse competitive consequences. Second, by enabling
      multiple goals the boundary organization increased the attractiveness of industry-informed
      agendas for academic scientists. We work our results into a grounded model of
      boundary organizations as a vehicle for open data initiatives. Our study contributes
      to research on public–private research partnerships, knowledge revealing and
      boundary organizations.\n\n"

    abstract: "The use of digital communication technologies, and of mobile phones
      in particular, has seen an exponential rise in low- and middle-income countries
      over the last decade. These data, emitted as a byproduct of technologies such
      as mobile phone location information and calling metadata, have the potential
      to fill some of the problematic gaps in data resources available to country
      policymakers and international development organisations. Using three examples
      of current big data initiatives in the international development field, we examine
      the implications of these new types of data for development policy and planning:
      their advantages and drawbacks, emerging practices relating to their use, and
      how they potentially influence ideas and policies of development. We also assess
      the politics of these new types of digital data, which are often collected and
      processed by corporations or by researchers in industrialised countries. Our
      analysis indicates that these new data sources already represent an important
      complement to country-level statistics, but that there are currently important
      challenges which will need to addressed if the promises of big data in development
      are to be fulfilled.\n\n"

      for decision making in public health at the local, national, and global level.
      Despite a global commitment to the use and sharing of public health data, this
      can be challenging in reality. No systematic framework or global operational
      guidelines have been created for data sharing in public health. Barriers at
      different levels have limited data sharing but have only been anecdotally discussed
      or in the context of specific case studies. Incomplete systematic evidence on
      the scope and variety of these barriers has limited opportunities to maximize
      the value and use of public health data for science and policy.\n\n"

    abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing trend of releasing public
      sector information as open data. Governments worldwide see the potential benefits
      of opening up their data. The potential benefits are more transparency, increased
      governmental efficiency and effectiveness, and external benefits, including
      societal and economic benefits. The private sector also recognizes potential
      benefits of making their datasets available as open data. One such company is
      Liander, an energy network administrator in the Netherlands. Liander views open
      data as a contributing factor to energy conservation. However, to date there
      has been little research done into the actual effects of open data. This research
      has developed a monitoring framework to assess the effects of open data, and
      has applied the framework to Liander’s small-scale energy consumption dataset

  title: Selected Readings on Civic Technology
  author:
  - Rebecca Rumbul
  affiliation:
  - mySociety
  description: "mySociety’s vision is for citizens around the world to feel empowered
    to interact efficiently, effectively and meaningfully with their governments and
    decision-makers using low cost and user-friendly civic technology. We want to
    enable citizens to communicate through accessible means, to solve their problems
    and to get what they are entitled to from institutions.\n\nWe believe that strong
    democratic accountability and a thriving civil society are vital to our common
    welfare, and that these cannot survive where people do not engage with government
    and communities. We work online because we believe that the internet can meaningfully
    lower the barriers to taking the first civic or democratic steps in a citizen’s
    life, and that it can do so at scale.\n\nThese selected readings on civic technology
    reflect this vision and greatly improve our understanding of how and why civic
    tech is having an impact. \n\n\n__EVALUATING DIGITAL CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT : A PRACTICAL
    GUIDE__\n\n*World Bank Group (2015)*\n\nWhenever I speak to someone that’s just
    getting started in the civic tech world, this is the first report I suggest they
    read. It's primarily aimed at practitioners rather than researchers, but it’s
    a wonderful introduction to the key concepts, the challenges, the language and
    the global landscape of civic tech. This report was informed by a lot of the main
    stakeholders in civic tech, and includes great examples of the work that’s happening,
    and the tasks associated with increasing and measuring digital civic engagement.
    Civic tech is maturing as a field, and this report provides much encouraging inspiration
    in analysing the real-world impacts of civic technologies, going beyond primitive
    measurements to discuss meaningful methods.\n\n\n__THE PROBLEM OF CITIZENS: E-DEMOCRACY
    FOR ACTUALLY EXISTING DEMOCRACY__\n\n*Kreiss (2015)*\n\nThis is an incredibly
    thoughtful article that considers e-democracy initiatives to be fundamentally
    flawed in their designs, and based on flawed assumptions about users being impartial
    and non-partisan. It argues against generalising users of civic tech into a homogenous
    group, and proposes that citizens be encouraged to deliberate and collaborate
    both within and between partisan groupings in order to enhance understanding.
    Whilst I find many of the suggestions in this paper impractical or unrealistic,
    and I do not necessarily agree with the author on several points, the reason I
    enjoy it so much is because it challenges assumptions that tend to be embedded
    into the civic tech sphere, and prompts me to think about civic tech solutions
    in a different way. In any field, there can be a tendency towards institutionalisation,
    and this paper pushes against those boundaries with some very interesting arguments.
    \n \n \n__\"I WLD LIKE U WMP TO EXTEND ELECTRICITY 2 OUR VILLAGE\": ON INFORMATION
    TECHNOLOGY AND INTEREST ARTICULATION__ \n\n*Grossman, Humphreys & Saramone-Lutz
    (2014)*\n\nIn a world where aid and development agencies, as well as philanthropists
    and civil society, are promoting the transformative potential of the internet
    in increasing civic engagement, this piece of research provides an incredibly
    valuable insight into how individuals in developing countries are actually using
    civic tech. A key risk in the research of civic tech is in drawing conclusions
    based upon distinct or unrepresentative constituencies, and this research team
    went to great lengths to conduct a high quality and well targeted analysis of
    the low-income and marginalised individuals that are of significant interest to
    the development community. This is an important piece of literature that I take
    inspiration from when designing my own research projects. \n\n\n__WHO BENEFITS
    FROM CIVIC TECH?__\n\n*mySociety (2015)*\n\nIt seems a little narcissistic to
    cite a report produced by my own organisation, but it's a report that provides
    some useful insights into the users of civic tech, and how they feel about the
    tools that they are using. It is again, something of a starting point for people
    who are just entering the world of civic tech, and provides an overview not just
    of demographics, but of public attitudes. The great thing about this report is
    its comparative aspect, looking at both developed countries and developing countries,
    and whilst it makes for uncomfortable reading in places (identifying the gender,
    age and educational imbalances in the user bases), it also provides encouraging
    data concerning users self-reported empowerment. \n\n\n__WHEN DOES ICT-ENABLED
    CITIZEN VOICE LEAD TO GOVERNMENT RESPONSIVENESS?__\n\n*Peixoto & Fox (2016)* \n\nThis
    is a really important piece of research examining one of the most critical aspects
    of e-democracy technologies; the responsiveness of governments. Civic technologists
    can build the most beautifully crafted and user friendly platforms in the world,
    but if politicians or bureaucrats are unwilling or unable to be responsive to
    the issues raised by the platforms, then failure is inevitable, and the consequence
    is a disillusioned public. This research unfortunately does not provide a very
    encouraging picture of current institutional behaviours, however is inspirational
    and thought-provoking for civic technologists in identifying a key issue that
    requires an innovative solution. "

    abstract: |-
      With growing demand for transparency, accountability and citizen participation in
       policy making and service provision, engagement between citizens and their governments,
       as well as with donors and the private sector that deliver government
       services, is increasingly important. Increased use of technology brings both opportunities
       and challenges to citizen engagement processes, including opportunities
       for collecting, analyzing and evaluating data about these processes. This guide provides
       practical steps to assess the extent to which digital tools have contributed to
       citizen engagement and the help to understand the impact that the introduction of
       technology has had on the engagement processes. With examples and lessons from case studies from Brazil, Uganda, Cameroon and
       Kenya, the guide provides practical tools and guidelines for use in evaluating the
       expanding field of digital citizen engagement.

    abstract: 'How does access to information communication technology (ICT) affect
      who gets heard and what gets communicated to politicians? On the one hand, ICT
      can lower communication costs for poorer constituents; on the other, technological
      channels may be used disproportionately more by the already well connected.
      To assess the flattening effects of ICTs, we presented a representative sample
      of constituents in Uganda with an opportunity to send a text message to their
      representatives at one of three randomly assigned prices. Critically, and contrary
      to concerns that technological innovations benefit the privileged, we find evidence
      that ICT can lead to significant flattening: a greater share of marginalized
      populations use this channel compared to existing political communication channels.
      Price plays a more complex role. Subsidizing the full cost of messaging increases
      uptake by over 40%. Surprisingly however, subsidy-induced increases in uptake
      do not yield further flattening since free channels are not used at higher rates
      by more marginalized constituents.'

      This paper reviews evidence on the use of 23 information and communication technology (ICT) platforms
       to project citizen voice to improve public service delivery. This meta-analysis focuses on empirical studies
       of initiatives in the global South, highlighting both citizen uptake (‘yelp’) and the degree to which public
       service providers respond to expressions of citizen voice (‘teeth’). The conceptual framework further distinguishes
       between two trajectories for ICT-enabled citizen voice: Upwards accountability occurs when users
       provide feedback directly to decision-makers in real time, allowing policy-makers and program managers
       to identify and address service delivery problems – but at their discretion. Downwards accountability, in
       contrast, occurs either through real time user feedback or less immediate forms of collective civic action
       that publicly call on service providers to become more accountable and depends less exclusively on decision-
       makers’ discretion about whether or not to act on the information provided. This distinction between
       the ways in which ICT platforms mediate the relationship between citizens and service providers allows for
       a precise analytical focus on how different dimensions of such platforms contribute to public sector responsiveness.
       These cases suggest that while ICT platforms have been relevant in increasing policymakers’
       and senior managers’ capacity to respond, most of them have yet to influence their willingness to do so.

    abstract: 'This article argues that many contemporary e-democracy projects, particularly
      in the United States, have at their heart a model of atomistic, independent,
      rational, and general-interest citizens. As such, these projects, variously
      grouped under the labels of e-governance, online deliberation, open government,
      and civic technology, often assume a broad shared consensus about collective
      definitions of “public problems” that both does not exist and sidesteps debates
      over what these problems are and what potential solutions can and should be.
      Drawing on recent theories of political parties, social identity, and cultural
      cognition, this article argues that e-democracy efforts need to account for
      the fact that the citizens practitioners appeal to see themselves by default
      as members of social groups, and that this has implications for politics and
      what Jasanoff calls “civic epistemology.” Presenting the case of attempting
      to change Republican opinions about climate change, I argue that e-democracy
      initiatives should seek to foster collaboration and deliberation within, not
      between, parties and among partisans. To do so, e-democratic reformers need
      to explicitly structure the collaborative and deliberative environment so there
      is a range of intra-party opinions and beliefs as part of the consultative and
      policy-making process.

  title: Selected Readings on Policy Informatics
  author:
  - Erik Johnston
  affiliation:
  - Center for Policy Informatics
  description: "__Policy informatics__ is the transdisciplinary study and application
    of how computation and communication technology leverages information to better
    understand and address complex public policy and administration problems and realize
    innovations in governance processes and institutions. Rapid advancements in information,
    computation, and communication technology continue to proliferate society and
    become increasingly embedded in our everyday activities, transforming how we learn,
    communicate, coordinate, organize, produce, consume, and govern. As the world
    becomes increasingly complex, interconnected, dynamic, and resource-constrained,
    so do the public issues with which we must grapple. In an information-intensive
    governance environment, advancements in information, computation, and communication
    technology afford us the possibility to better tackle complex public issues in
    new and innovative ways that tap into and reflect the reality of this world. In
    particular, this involves liberating data, cultivating the bottom-up generation
    of data and ideas, modeling and simulating system dynamics of coupled human-environmental
    interactions, as well as engaging, educating, and empowering public officials,
    future researchers, and the public-at-large to interact with data and one another
    in a manner that collectively produces meaningful insights, solutions, and actions
    to address public issues.\n\nThe following reading materials are useful for scholars
    and practitioners to understand policy informatics theoretically and practically
    and to apply it in diverse social and policy contexts. Most of the readings were
    selected because in addition to a theoretical contribution, they regularly are
    situated in useful applications across many contexts including health, education,
    and the environment. The readings range from motivating the urgency behind a formal
    study of policy informatics, to highlighting advances in analytics including simulation
    and computational analytics, to design recommendations of the open organizational
    implications of a increasingly connected public through crowdsourcing, participatory
    platforms, and citizen science, to emerging ethical considerations including the
    digitally invisible and algorithmic biases. \n"

    abstract: Public policy and management problems have been described as poorly
      defined, messy, squishy, unstructured, intractable, and wicked. In a word, they
      are complex. This book illustrates the development and use of simulation models
      designed to capture some of the complexity inherent in the formulation, management,
      and implementation of policies aimed at addressing such problems. Simulation
      models have long existed at the fringes of policy inquiry but are not yet considered
      an essential component of the policy analyst’s toolkit. However, this situation
      is likely to change because with improvements in computational power and software,
      simulation is now easier to include in the standard repertoire of research tools
      available for discovery and decision support. This volume provides both a conceptual
      rationale for using simulations to inform public policy and a practical introduction
      to how such models might be constructed and employed. The focus of these papers
      is on the uses of simulation to gain understanding and inform policy decisions
      and action. Techniques represented in this volume include Monte Carlo simulation,
      system dynamics and agent based modeling.

      The book will help mayors, chief technology officers, city administrators, agency
      directors, civic groups and nonprofit leaders break out of current paradigms
      to collectively address civic problems. The Responsive City is the culmination
      of research originating from the Data-Smart City Solutions initiative, an ongoing
      project at Harvard Kennedy School working to catalyze adoption of data projects
      on the city level. The book is co-authored by Professor Stephen Goldsmith, director
      of Data-Smart City Solutions at Harvard Kennedy School, and Professor Susan
      Crawford, co-director of Harvard''s Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
      Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg penned the book’s foreword.  Based
      on the authors’ experiences and extensive research, The Responsive City explores
      topics including: Building trust in the public sector and fostering a sustained,
      collective voice among communities; Using data-smart governance to preempt and
      predict problems while improving quality of life; Creating efficiencies and
      saving taxpayer money with digital tools; and Spearheading these new approaches
      to government with innovative leadership.

    abstract: Why does Procter & Gamble repeatedly call on enthusiastic amateurs to
      solve scientific and technical challenges? How can companies as diverse as iStockphoto
      and Threadless employ just a handful of people, yet generate millions of dollars
      in revenue every year? "Crowdsourcing" is how the power of the many can be leveraged
      to accomplish feats that were once the responsibility of a specialized few.
      Jeff Howe reveals that the crowd is more than wise–it’s talented, creative,
      and stunningly productive. It’s also a perfect meritocracy, where age, gender,
      race, education, and job history no longer matter; the quality of the work is
      all that counts. If you can perform the service, design the product, or solve
      the problem, you’ve got the job.But crowdsourcing has also triggered a dramatic
      shift in the way work is organized, talent is employed, research is conducted,
      and products are made and marketed. As the crowd comes to supplant traditional
      forms of labor, pain and disruption are inevitable, and Howe delves into both
      the positive and negative consequences of this intriguing phenomenon. Through
      extensive reporting from the front lines of this workplace revolution, he employs
      a brilliant array of stories to look at the economic, cultural, business, and
      political implications of crowdsourcing.

    abstract: A governance infrastructure is the collection of technologies and systems,
      people, policies, practices, and relationships that interact to support governing
      activities. Information technology, especially communication and computational
      technologies, continues to augment society’s ability to organize, interact,
      and govern. As we think about the future of governance, this article challenges
      us to move beyond questions of how to best manage government institutions to
      how to design smart governance systems with the appropriate incentives and rules
      to harness and coordinate the enthusiasm and capabilities of those governed.
      This article anticipates how the interaction of technology and society can be
      leveraged to mindfully design an interaction-defined, participation-based governance
      infrastructure to return power to the people while increasing accountability.
      Supporting examples of such governance approaches already exist and are regularly
      emerging in distributed organizations, online communities, nonprofits, and governments.

    abstract: Policy informatics is addressing governance challenges and their consequences,
      which span the seeming inability of governments to solve complex problems and
      the disaffection of people from their governments. Policy informatics seeks
      approaches that enable our governance systems to address increasingly complex
      challenges and to meet the rising expectations of people to be full participants
      in their communities. This book approaches these challenges by applying a combination
      of the latest American and European approaches in applying complex systems modeling,
      crowdsourcing, participatory platforms and citizen science to explore complex
      governance challenges in domains that include education, environment, and health.

    abstract: This chapter provides design lessons on how to take advantage of advances
      in information technologies that have enabled new governance infrastructures
      to become both possible and desirable. A governance infrastructure is the collection
      of technologies, people, policies, practices, resources, social norms, and information
      that interact to support governing activities. Smart governance infrastructures
      augment society's ability to organize, interact, and govern. Novel instances
      of smart governance infrastructures already exist and are regularly emerging
      in distributed organizations and online communities. As we think about rebooting
      the public square, this chapter is intended to challenge us to move beyond questions
      of how to best manage government institutions to questions of how to design
      governance systems with the appropriate incentives and rules to harness and
      coordinate the diversity, enthusiasm, and capabilities of those governed. We
      provide several design lessons learned from successful governance infrastructures
      and propose how they can be applied to address national priorities. This chapter
      anticipates how the interaction of technology and society can be leveraged to
      mindfully design problem-defined, participation-based governance infrastructures
      to return power to the people while increasing accountability and efficiency.

    abstract: The need for a fresh approach to U.S. communities is more urgent than
      ever because of the biggest global economic crisis since the Great Depression.
      Through examination of the barriers to solving urban problems (and the ways
      they reinforce each other), this paper offers a new approach to community transformation
      which calls for leaders to use technology to inform and connect people. We need
      to convert the social safety net into a social safety network through the creation
      of smarter communities that are information-rich, interconnected, and able to
      provide opportunities to all citizens. This process has already begun through
      such programs as Harlem Children's Zone, Baltimore's CitiStat, Elevate Miami,
      and others. And they can be replicated. But technology alone is not the answer.
      Realization of the vision requires leaders to invest in the tools, guide their
      use, and pave the way for transformation. Perhaps the urgency of the current
      economic crisis can provide the impetus to overcome resistance to change and
      turn problems into an opportunity to reduce costs, improve services to communities,
      and make our cities smarter.

    abstract: A recent New York law requires medical providers to offer HIV tests
      as part of routine care. We developed a system dynamics simulation model of
      the HIV testing and care system to help administrators understand the law's
      potential epidemic impact, resource needs, strategies to improve implementation,
      and appropriate outcome indicators for future policy evaluations once postlaw
      data become available. Policy modeling allowed us to synthesize information
      from numerous sources including quantitative administrative data sets and practitioners'
      content expertise, structure the information to be viewed both numerically and
      visually, and organize consensus for decisionmaking purposes. This case illustrates
      how policy modeling can provide an integrated framework for administrators to
      examine policy problems in complex systems, particularly when data time lags
      limit pre--post comparisons and key outcomes cannot be measured directly.

    abstract: 'The book comprehensively debunks the myth of a lumbering, bureaucratic
      state versus a dynamic, innovative private sector. In a series of case studies—from
      IT, biotech, nanotech to today’s emerging green tech—Professor Mazzucato shows
      that the opposite is true: the private sector only finds the courage to invest
      after an entrepreneurial state has made the high-risk investments. In an intensely
      researched chapter, she reveals that every technology that makes the iPhone
      so ‘smart’ was government funded: the Internet, GPS, its touch-screen display
      and the voice-activated Siri. Mazzucato also controversially argues that in
      the history of modern capitalism the State has not only fixed market failures,
      but has also actively shaped and created markets. In doing so, it sometimes
      wins and sometimes fails. Yet by not admitting the State’s role in such active
      risk taking, and pretending that the state only cheers on the side-lines while
      the private sector roars, we have ended up creating an ‘innovation system’ whereby
      the public sector socializes risks, while rewards are privatized. The book considers
      how to change this dysfunctional dynamic so that economic growth can be not
      only ‘smart’ but also ‘inclusive’.'

    abstract: Government “of the people, by the people, for the people” expresses
      an ideal that resonates in all democracies. Yet poll after poll reveals deep
      distrust of institutions that seem to have left “the people” out of the governing
      equation. Government bureaucracies that are supposed to solve critical problems
      on their own are a troublesome outgrowth of the professionalization of public
      life in the industrial age. They are especially ill-suited to confronting today’s
      complex challenges. Offering a far-reaching program for innovation, Smart Citizens,
      Smarter State suggests that public decisionmaking could be more effective and
      legitimate if government were smarter—if our institutions knew how to use technology
      to leverage citizens’ expertise. Just as individuals use only part of their
      brainpower to solve most problems, governing institutions make far too little
      use of the skills and experience of those inside and outside of government with
      scientific credentials, practical skills, and ground-level street smarts. New
      tools—what Beth Simone Noveck calls technologies of expertise—are making it
      possible to match the supply of citizen expertise to the demand for it in government.
      Drawing on a wide range of academic disciplines and practical examples from
      her work as an adviser to governments on institutional innovation, Noveck explores
      how to create more open and collaborative institutions. In so doing, she puts
      forward a profound new vision for participatory democracy rooted not in the
      paltry act of occasional voting or the serendipity of crowdsourcing but in people’s
      knowledge and know-how.

    abstract: Every day, corporations are connecting the dots about our personal behavior—silently
      scrutinizing clues left behind by our work habits and Internet use. The data
      compiled and portraits created are incredibly detailed, to the point of being
      invasive. But who connects the dots about what firms are doing with this information?
      The Black Box Society argues that we all need to be able to do so—and to set
      limits on how big data affects our lives. Hidden algorithms can make (or ruin)
      reputations, decide the destiny of entrepreneurs, or even devastate an entire
      economy. Shrouded in secrecy and complexity, decisions at major Silicon Valley
      and Wall Street firms were long assumed to be neutral and technical. But leaks,
      whistleblowers, and legal disputes have shed new light on automated judgment.
      Self-serving and reckless behavior is surprisingly common, and easy to hide
      in code protected by legal and real secrecy. Even after billions of dollars
      of fines have been levied, underfunded regulators may have only scratched the
      surface of this troubling behavior. Frank Pasquale exposes how powerful interests
      abuse secrecy for profit and explains ways to rein them in. Demanding transparency
      is only the first step. An intelligible society would assure that key decisions
      of its most important firms are fair, nondiscriminatory, and open to criticism.
      Silicon Valley and Wall Street need to accept as much accountability as they
      impose on others.

    abstract: In his bestselling Here Comes Everybody, Internet guru Clay Shirky provided
      readers with a much-needed primer for the digital age. Now, with Cognitive Surplus,
      he reveals how new digital technology is unleashing a torrent of creative production
      that will transform our world. For the first time, people are embracing new
      media that allow them to pool their efforts at vanishingly low cost. The results
      of this aggregated effort range from mind-expanding reference tools like Wikipedia
      to life-saving Web sites like Ushahidi.com, which allows Kenyans to report acts
      of violence in real time. Cognitive Surplus explores what's possible when people
      unite to use their intellect, energy, and time for the greater good.

    abstract: Public  organizations  have  interacted  with  citizens  through increasingly  sophisticated  internet-enabled  technology.  Participatory
      platforms  emerged  from  Web  2.0  technologies  in  the  mid-2000s  as  a
      governance mechanism to  engage  citizens in the process of  effecting  social
      change.  Although  the  potential  of  platforms  is  recognized,  its  successful
      implementation has faced challenges. To begin to get a handle on how to best
      design  and  manage  participatory  platforms,  we  conducted  an  exploratory
      participatory  action  research  study  grounded  in  two  events  –  The  Policy
      Challenge and NSF Workshop on Participatory Platforms with a Public Intent.
      Both events  communed  practitioners,  scholars,  and citizen participants with
      diverse experience and expertise conducting and researching platforms. The insights  expressed  through  the
      events  and  follow-up  interviews  and  online survey  informed  our  development  of  a  participatory  platform  lifecycle  and
      design framework to assist designing successful participatory platforms.

    abstract: |-
      The public pays for and provides an incredible amount of data to governments and companies. Yet much of the value of this data is being wasted, remaining in silos rather than being shared to enhance the common good—whether it’s helping governments to stop opioid addiction or helping companies predict and meet the demand for electric or autonomous vehicles.

      Many companies and governments are interested in sharing more of their data with each other; however, right now the process of sharing is very time consuming and can pose great risks since it often involves sharing full data sets with another entity.

      We need intermediaries to design safe environments to facilitate data sharing in the low-trust and politically sensitive context of companies and governments. These safe environments would exist outside the government, be transparent to the public, and use modern technologies and techniques to allow only statistical uses of data through temporary linkages in order to minimize the risk to individuals’ privacy.

    abstract: For the past three years, the Centre for Information Policy Leadership
      at Hunton & Williams LLP has served as secretariat for the Accountability Project.
      The Accountability Project is the work of an international group of experts
      that includes representatives of privacy enforcement agencies from Europe, North
      America, and the Asia-Pacific region; civil society; academia and business.
      Its mission is to consider how an accountabilitybased system of data protection
      might be designed. The inquiry originally focused on cross-border data transfers,
      but expanded to address how to apply accountability to improve compliance with
      privacy requirements and to enable more flexible information management. This
      paper reflects the discussions and findings of the Accountability Project, and
      is intended solely to serve as a report of the work of that initiative
