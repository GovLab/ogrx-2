    Purpose
    – The purpose of this paper is to develop a method for better analyzing the utility and impact of new technologies on smart cities. The authors have designed a tool that will evaluate new technologies according to a three-pronged scoring system that considers the impact on physical space, environmental issues and city residents. The purpose of this tool is to be used by city planners as part of a strategic approach to the implementation of a smart city initiative in order to reduce unnecessary public spending and ensure the optimal allocation of city resources.

    Design/methodology/approach
    – The information and communication technologies that manage and transform twenty-first century cities must be reviewed, analyzing their impact on new social behaviors that shape the spaces and means of communication, developing a new methodology and setting the basis for an analysis matrix to score the different and technologies that affect a smart city environment.

    Research limitations/implications
    – Traditional technological scenarios have been challenged, and smart cities have become the center of urban competitiveness. A lack of clarity has been detected in the way of describing what smart cities are, and the authors try to establish a methodology for urban policy makers to do so. As a dynamic process that affects several aspects, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed solution further.

    Practical implications
    – After a review of the state-of-the-art, the authors found that there are no existing systems for assessing smart city strategies regarding new, evolving technologies. The methodology attempts to design a simple tool to bring urban developers and policy makers closer to the technology and to have an instrument with which to compare different alternatives before choosing one.

    Social implications
    – Helped by new technologies, citizens are the ones who have the power to define new urban scenarios. For this reason the methodology the authors propose must have citizens and their needs as the ultimate reference, considering all the social, physical and environmental effects on people before selecting a new technology for urban strategies.

    Originality/value
    – This paper fulfills an identified need to study how new technologies could affect urban scenarios before being applied, developing an analysis system in the form of a matrix to be used by urban planners and policy makers to decide how best to use them.

  abstract: Critics frequently argue that nudges are more covert, less transparent,
    and more difficult to monitor than traditional regulatory tools. Edward Glaeser,
    for example, argues that “[p]ublic monitoring of soft paternalism is much more
    difficult than public monitoring of hard paternalism.” As one of the leading proponents
    of soft paternalism, Cass Sunstein, acknowledges, while “[m]andates and commands
    are highly visible,” soft paternalism, “and some nudges in particular[,] may be
    invisible.” In response to this challenge, proponents of nudging argue that invisibility
    for any given individual in a particular choice environment is compatible with
    “careful public scrutiny” of the nudge. This paper offers first of its kind experimental
    evidence that tests whether nudges are, in fact, compatible with careful public
    scrutiny. Using two sets of experiments, the paper argues that, even when made
    visible, nudges attract less scrutiny than their “hard law” counterparts.

  abstract: 'Responsive City is a guide to civic engagement and governance in the
    digital age that will help leaders link important breakthroughs in technology
    and data analytics with age-old lessons of small-group community input to create
    more agile, competitive, and economically resilient cities. Featuring vivid case
    studies highlighting the work of pioneers in New York, Boston, Chicago and more,
    the book provides a compelling model for the future of governance. The book will
    help mayors, chief technology officers, city administrators, agency directors,
    civic groups and nonprofit leaders break out of current paradigms to collectively
    address civic problems. The Responsive City is the culmination of research originating
    from the Data-Smart City Solutions initiative, an ongoing project at Harvard Kennedy
    School working to catalyze adoption of data projects on the city level. The book
    is co-authored by Professor Stephen Goldsmith, director of Data-Smart City Solutions
    at Harvard Kennedy School, and Professor Susan Crawford, co-director of Harvard''s
    Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
    penned the book’s foreword.  Based on the authors’ experiences and extensive research,
    The Responsive City explores topics including: Building trust in the public sector
    and fostering a sustained, collective voice among communities; Using data-smart
    governance to preempt and predict problems while improving quality of life; Creating
    efficiencies and saving taxpayer money with digital tools; and Spearheading these
    new approaches to government with innovative leadership.

  abstract: This meta-analytic study reviews empirical research published from 2007
    to 2013 with an aim of providing robust conclusions about the relationship between
    social media use and citizen engagement. It includes 22 studies that used self-reported
    measures of social media use and participation, with a total of 116 relationships/effects.
    The results suggest that social media use generally has a positive relationship
    with engagement and its three sub-categories, that is, social capital, civic engagement,
    and political participation. More specifically, we find small-to-medium size positive
    relationships between expressive, informational, and relational uses of social
    media and the above indicators of citizen engagement. For identity- and entertainment-oriented
    uses of social media, our analyses find little evidence supporting their relationship
    with citizen engagement.

  abstract: 'This article shows how activists in the open data movement re-articulate
    notions of democracy, participation, and journalism by applying practices and
    values from open source culture to the creation and use of data. Focusing on the
    Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews
    and content analysis, it argues that this process leads activists to develop new
    rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied publics.
    Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a
    prerequisite for generating knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source
    code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should break the interpretative
    monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation
    of data about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and
    flexible form of representative democracy by applying the open source model of
    participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermediaries
    are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an
    interest in transforming journalism to become an intermediary in this sense. At
    the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic
    technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting
    that the practices and ideas of open data activists are relevant because they
    illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help
    to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors
    outside big government and big business.'

  abstract: 'This critical and scoping review essay analyses digital labour markets
    where labour-intensive services are traded by matching requesters (employers and/or
    consumers) and providers (workers). It focuses on digital labour markets which
    allow the remote delivery of electronically transmittable services (i.e. Amazon
    Mechanical Turk, Upwork, Freelancers, etc.) and those where the matching and administration
    processes are digital but the delivery of the services is physical and requires
    direct interaction. The former broad type is called Online Labour Markets (OLMs)
    and is potentially global. The latter broad type is termed Mobile Labour Markets
    (MLMs) and is by definition localised. The essay defines and conceptualises these
    markets proposing a typology which proves to be empirically valid and heuristically
    useful. It describes their functioning and the socio-demographic profiles of the
    participants, reviews their economic and social effects, discusses the possible
    policy implications, and concludes with a research agenda to support European
    level policy making. It alternates the discussion of ‘hard’ findings from experimental
    and quasi-experimental studies with analysis of ‘softer’ issues such as rhetorical
    discourses and media ‘hyped’ accounts. This triangulation is inspired by, and
    a tribute to, the enduring legacy of the work of Albert O. Hirschman and his view
    that ideas and rhetoric can become endogenous engines of social change, reforms,
    and policies. This essay tries to disentangle the rhetoric with available empirical
    evidence in order to enable a more rational debate at least in the discussion
    of policies, if not in the public arena. To do so, an in depth analysis of 39
    platforms was undertaken together with a formal review of 70 scientific sources.
    These two main sources have been integrated with: a) an exploration of 100 media
    accounts (business press, newspapers, magazines, and blogs); b) 50 reports and
    surveys produced by ‘interested parties’ (industrial associations, platforms own
    reports and public relation materials, think tanks with a clear political orientation,
    NGOs, trade unions, etc.); and c) about 200 indirectly relevant scientific contributions
    and policy reports (used as sources to contextualise and integrate the above sources,
    and to derive theoretical and interpretative insights). While the evidence is
    limited and inconclusive with respect to various dimensions, the findings of this
    essay show, among other things, that: a) individuals engage in these activities
    primarily for money, for a large segment of them this work is their primary source
    of income, and most are under-employed and self-employed and fewer are unemployed
    and inactive; b) matching frictions and hiring inefficiencies are widespread and
    even the OLMs are far from being globalised online meritocracies; c) a behavioural
    approach to big data exploration should be further applied because there is emerging
    evidence of heuristic and biases contributing to hiring inefficiencies.'

  abstract: |-
    In this paper we study the public debate over net neutrality in the United States from January through
    November 2014. We compiled, mapped, and analyzed over 16,000 stories published on net neutrality,
    augmented by data from Twitter, bit.ly, and Google Trends. Using a mixed-methods approach that
    combines link analysis with qualitative content analysis, we describe the evolution of the debate over time
    and assess the role, reach, and influence of different media sources and advocacy groups in setting the
    agenda, framing the debate, and mobilizing collective action. We conclude that a diverse set of actors
    working in conjunction through the networked public sphere played a central, arguably decisive, role in
    turning around the Federal Communications Commission policy on net neutrality.

  abstract: Humanitarian organisations should begin the process now of understanding
    what big data is, what its analysis can yield answers to, and how and when to
    use it. This document has been created to provide a broad overview of big data
    usage in humanitarian organisations and general guidance on how organisations
    can incorporate it into operations. It describes big data and its role within
    the humanitarian sector, offers a categorisation of the large variety of big data
    types, highlights benefits and risks of incorporating big data into response,
    identifies policy and ethical considerations for the organisation, and provides
    example materials organisations can use when starting the process of in-corporating
    big data. The goal is to create dialogue and generate structure in the conversation
    among decision makers, data scientists, and volunteers and technical communities.

  abstract: Information of all kinds is now being produced, collected, and analyzed
    at unprecedented speed, breadth, depth, and scale. The capacity to collect and
    analyze massive data sets has already transformed fields such as biology, astronomy,
    and physics, but the social sciences have been comparatively slower to adapt,
    and the path forward is less certain. For many, the big data revolution promises
    to ask, and answer, fundamental questions about individuals and collectives, but
    large data sets alone will not solve major social or scientific problems. New
    paradigms being developed by the emerging field of “computational social science”
    will be needed not only for research methodology, but also for study design and
    interpretation, cross-disciplinary collaboration, data curation and dissemination,
    visualization, replication, and research ethics (Lazer et al., 2009). SAGE Publishing
    conducted a survey with social scientists around the world to learn more about
    researchers engaged in big data research and the challenges they face, as well
    as the barriers to entry for those looking to engage in this kind of research
    in the future. We were also interested in the challenges of teaching computational
    social science methods to students. The survey was fully completed by 9412 respondents,
    indicating strong interest in this topic among our social science contacts. Of
    respondents, 33 percent had been involved in big data research of some kind and,
    of those who have not yet engaged in big data research, 49 percent (3057 respondents)
    said that they are either “definitely planning on doing so in the future” or “might
    do so in the future.”

  abstract: 'Transparency has become the watchword of twenty-first century liberal
    democracies. It refers to a project of ‘opening up’ the state by providing online
    access to public sector data. This article puts forward a sociological critique
    of the transparency agenda and the purported relationship between institutional
    openness and public trust. Drawing upon Simmel’s (1906) work, the article argues
    that open government initiatives routinely prize visibility over intelligibility
    and ignore the communicative basis of trust. The result is a non-reciprocal form
    of openness that obscures more than it reveals. In making this point, the article
    suggests that transparency embodies the ethos of a now-discredited mode of ‘instrumental
    politics’, reliant on the idea that the state constitutes a ‘domain of plain public
    facts’ (Ezrahi, 2004: 106). The article examines how alternative mechanisms for
    achieving government openness might better respond to the distinctive needs of
    citizens living in late modern societies.'
