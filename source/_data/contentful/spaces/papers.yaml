    Open data is often an integral part of promoting transparency, fighting corruption and harnessing new technologies to strengthen governance. But to implement ‘good’ open data, government departments must coordinate to share data that is intersectoral, linked, in standard open formats, and – most importantly – is relevant and current.

    In 2011, South Africa was a co-founder of the multilateral Open Government Partnership (OGP), which works to secure and implement open government commitments in its member countries. Experience with OGP initiatives shows that coordinating different government departments and agencies is a challenge for implementation – especially when it comes to open data.

    This practitioner-based participatory research was carried out by the Open Democracy Advice Centre (ODAC), leading experts in access to information in South Africa, who have been deeply engaged in research and advocacy around South Africa’s OGP commitments. The research discusses the challenge of coordination, drawing lessons for South Africa from experiences of coordination in other countries.

    In Nairobi in 2009, 13 young residents of the informal settlement of Kibera mapped their community using OpenStreetMap, an online mapping platform. This was the start of Map Kibera, and eight years of ongoing work to date on digital mapping, citizen media and open data.

    In this paper, Erica Hagen – one of the initiators of Map Kibera – reflects on the trajectory of this work. Through research interviews with Map Kibera staff, participants and clients, and users of the data and maps the project has produced, she digs into what it means for citizens to map their communities, and examines the impact of open local information on members of the community.

  abstract: How unrestricted or restricted should judges be when deciding a sentence?
    To what extent should sentences be predetermined, or to what extent should judges
    be left with the right to decide a sentence in each individual case? Some legal
    systems, most notably in the United States, have chosen sentencing guidelines
    to control judicial discretion. However, another approach has been to use computer
    technology in the form of so‐called sentencing information systems (SIS). This
    article examines these developments and what possible influence they have had
    and could have in the Scandinavian, particularly in the Norwegian, context. Penal
    institutions today are adjusting to the demands of the information society. Does
    and could the fact that we are living in an increasingly technologically mediated
    world influence judicial decision‐making? The article argues that the use of technology
    is not simply a question of technological change, but is first and foremost a
    social and political phenomenon, related to the relations of trust in a society.

  abstract: 'This book explores how public opinion is used to design, monitor and
    evaluate government programmes in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United
    Kingdom. Using information collected from the media and from international practitioners
    in the public opinion field, as well as interviews in each of the 4 countries,
    the author describes how views of public opinion and governance differ significantly
    between elites and the general public. Bennett argues that elites generally risk
    more by allowing the creation of new data, fearing that its analysis may become
    public and create communications and political problems of various kinds. The
    book finds evidence that recent conservative governments in several countries
    are changing their perspective on the use of public opinion, and that conventional
    public opinion studies are facing challenges from the availability of other kinds
    of information and new technologies. This book is a hugely valuable contribution
    to a hitherto little explored field and will appeal to academics and practitioners
    alike. '

  abstract: "This paper explains the main features of and motivation for the “report
    once” demonstrator1 shown at the 2017 Data For Policy conference. It shows how
    Ethereum2 smart contracts, based on the semantics and algorithmic representations
    defined in ACTUS3 can implement “digital doppelgängers” of financial contracts.
    \  \n \nThe implementation makes use of a private4 Ethereum blockchain, with smart
    contracts written in Solidity.5 The limitations of using ACTUS in a semi real-time
    scenario are explored, as well as how to overcome these limitations.  \n \nThe
    major innovation, visualized by the demonstrator, is that compliance reports can
    be generated in semi realtime, using the information present in the “digital doppelgängers”,
    residing in the blockchain.  \n \nThe demonstrator supports various use cases,
    illustrated through the narration of stories. In these stories, Alice, Bob and
    Eve are contracting parties, Romeo acts as regulator, and the narrator tells the
    stories.  The stories cover trading a Bond, trading an Interest Rate Swap (IRS),
    the defaulting of a party (i.e. a payment stop), and various types of regulatory
    reports."

  abstract: |-
    Countless people around the world harness the affordances of digital media to enable democratic participation, coordinate disaster relief, campaign for policy change, and strengthen local advocacy groups. The world watched as activists used social media to organize protests during the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Hong Kong’s Umbrella Revolution. Many governmental and community organizations changed their mission and function as they adopted new digital tools and practices. This book examines the use of “civic media”—the technologies, designs, and practices that support connection through common purpose in civic, political, and social life. Scholars from a range of disciplines and practitioners from a variety of organizations offer analyses and case studies that explore the theory and practice of civic media.

    The contributors set out the conceptual context for the intersection of civic and media; examine the pressure to innovate and the sustainability of innovation; explore play as a template for resistance; look at civic education; discuss media-enabled activism in communities; and consider methods and funding for civic media research. The case studies that round out each section range from a “debt resistance” movement to government service delivery ratings to the “It Gets Better” campaign aimed at combating suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer youth. The book offers a valuable interdisciplinary dialogue on the challenges and opportunities of the increasingly influential space of civic media.

  abstract: |-
    The rapid spread of ICTs - and of mobile phones in particular - across low- and middle-income countries has generated considerable excitement in development circles regarding their potential to revolutionise service delivery in health systems. Broadly speaking, such innovations, widely referred to as mHealth, make possible new ways of collecting, collating and managing health and health service-related data, and novel means of communication between and among citizens, civil society, health service personnel and government actors. This can empower citizens to better understand, care and advocate for their own health; health workers to deliver improved services; and government actors to enforce or build health policies that uphold the health rights of all citizens, including poor and marginalised groups who are often systematically excluded from health systems.

    As mHealth is in its infancy, and most projects to date have been small in scale, this potential is still being tested. Furthermore, most research has focused on the extent to which mHealth has improved service delivery and/or health outcomes in the short term. There has been little explicit attention given to whether and how mHealth might improve accountability for public health services – that is, to what extent mHealth can enhance citizens’ abilities to demand improved services from providers and government in line with their rights, and/or augment the capacity and willingness of providers and government to respond to citizens’ needs and demands – both in the short and the long term.

    This Working Paper aims to begin to fill this gap by exploring literature on accountability in health systems and on mHealth. It lays out a clearer understanding of the role that mHealth can play in accountability for public health service, as well as its limitations. At the centre of this role is technology-facilitated information which, for instance, can help governments enforce and improve existing health policy, and which can assist citizens and civil society to communicate with each other to learn more about their rights, and to engage in data collection, monitoring and advocacy. Ultimately however, information, facilitated as it may be by mHealth, does not automatically lead to improved accountability. Thus, mHealth can serve as a tool for accountability, but is likely only able to make a difference in institutional systems that support accountability in other ways (both formal and informal) and in which political actors and health service providers are willing and able to change their behaviour.

  abstract: A number of governments worldwide employ web-based e-consultation platforms
    to enable stakeholders commenting on draft legislation. Stakeholders’ input includes
    arguing in favour or against the proposed legislation as well as proposing alternative
    ideas. In this paper, we empirically investigate the relationship between the
    volume of contributions in these platforms and the amount of new ideas that are
    generated. This enables us to determine whether participants in such platforms
    keep generating new ideas or just recycle a finite number of ideas. We capitalised
    on argumentation models to code and analyse a large number of draft law consultations
    published in opengov.gr, the official e-consultation platform for draft legislation
    in Greece. Our results suggest that as the number of posts grows, the number of
    new ideas continues to increase. The results of this study improve our understanding
    of the dynamics of these consultations and enable us to design better platforms.

  abstract: This article aims to contribute to a burgeoning field of 'civic technology'
    to identify precise pathways through which multi-stakeholder partnerships can
    foster, embed, and encourage more collaborative governance, outlining a research
    agenda to guide next steps. Instead of looking at technology as a civic panacea
    or, at the other extreme, as an irrelevant force, this article takes seriously
    both the democratic potential and the political constraints of the use of technology
    for more collaborative governance. The article begins by delineating contours
    of a civic definition of technology focused on generating public good, provides
    case study examples of civic tech deployed in America's cities, raises research
    questions to inform future multi-stakeholder partnerships, and concludes with
    implications for the public sector workforce and ecosystem.

  abstract: What effect does government responsiveness have on political participation?
    Since the 1940s political scientists have used attitudinal measures of perceived
    efficacy to explain participation. More recent work has focused on underlying
    genetic factors that condition citizen engagement. We develop a ‘Calculus of Participation’
    that incorporates objective efficacy – the extent to which an individual’s participation
    actually has an impact – and test the model against behavioral data from FixMyStreet.com
    (n=399,364). We find that a successful first experience using FixMyStreet.com
    (e.g., reporting a pothole and having it fixed) is associated with a 54 percent
    increase in the probability of an individual submit-ting a second report. We also
    show that the experience of government responsiveness to the first report submitted
    has predictive power over all future report submissions. The findings highlight
    the importance of government responsiveness for fostering an active citizenry,
    while demonstrating the value of incidentally collected data to examine participatory
    behavior at the individual level.

    Development Initiatives (DI) and Development Research and Training (DRT) received a Making All Voices Count practitioner research and learning grant to examine the purpose, use and users of citizen-generated data in two case studies.

    One case study examined how citizen-generated data on the quality of schools and schooling was channelled to the Ministry of Education in Kenya. The other case study looked at the work of community resource trackers in five communities in Uganda, and their role in providing unsolicited feedback to local government actors and other development partners.

  abstract: '"Digital age platforms are providing researchers the ability to outsource
    portions of their work – not just to increasingly intelligent machines, but also
    to a relatively low-cost online labor force comprised of humans. These so-called
    “online outsourcing” services help employers connect with a global pool of free-agent
    workers who are willing to complete a variety of specialized or repetitive tasks.
    Because it provides access to large numbers of workers at relatively low cost,
    online outsourcing holds a particular appeal for academics and nonprofit research
    organizations – many of whom have limited resources compared with corporate America.
    For instance, Pew Research Center has experimented with using these services to
    perform tasks such as classifying documents and collecting website URLs."'

  abstract: Big Data is changing our world with masses of information stored in huge
    servers spread across the planet. This new technology is changing not only companies
    but governments as well. Mexico and Brazil, two of the most influential countries
    in Latin America, are entering a new era and as a result, facing challenges in
    all aspects of public policy. Using Big Data, the Brazilian Government is trying
    to decrease spending and use public money better by grouping public information
    with stored information on citizens in public services. With new reforms in education,
    finances and telecommunications, the Mexican Government is taking on a bigger
    role in efforts to channel the country’s economic policy into an improvement of
    the quality of life of their habitants. It is known that technology is an important
    part for sub-developed countries, who are trying to make a difference in certain
    contexts such as reducing inequality or regulating the good usage of economic
    resources. The good use of Big Data, a new technology that is in charge of managing
    a big quantity of information, can be crucial for the Mexican Government to reach
    the goals that have been set in the past under Peña Nieto’s administration. This
    article focuses on how the Brazilian and Mexican Governments are managing the
    emerging technologies of Big Data and how it includes them in social and industrial
    projects to enhance the growth of their economies. The article also discusses
    the benefits of these uses of Big Data and the possible problems that occur related
    to security and privacy of information.

  abstract: |-
    When Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines in 2013, a number of national and local government tools, platforms and mechanisms were put in place to support the coordination of national government efforts to respond to the disaster. Many of them are web-based and accessible to the public. Some are specific to disaster risk reduction, while others are more general.

    This research assesses these tools, platforms and mechanisms in terms of how well they supported - and continue to support - the accountability and transparency of government interventions during disaster responses in the Philippines. It also looks at how these accountability can be further enhanced and replicated vertically and horizontally to help ensure that accountability and transparency are observed principles during all disaster responses.

  abstract: Billions of dollars have been spent on participatory development programs
    in the developing world. These programs give community members an active decision-making
    role. Given the emphasis on community involvement, one might expect that the effectiveness
    of this approach would depend on communities' pre-existing social capital stocks.
    Using data from a large randomised field experiment of Community-Led Total Sanitation
    in Indonesia, we find that villages with high initial social capital built toilets
    and reduced open defecation, resulting in substantial health benefits. In villages
    with low initial stocks of social capital, the approach was counterproductive
    – fewer toilets were built than in control communities and social capital suffered.

  abstract: Evidence is lacking for patient-reported effectiveness of treatments for
    most medical conditions and specifically for lower back pain. In thi spaper, we
    examined a consumer-based social network that collects patients' treatment ratings
    as a potential source of evidence. Acknowledging the potential biases of this
    data set, we used propensity score matching and generalized linear regression
    to account for confounding variables. To evaluate validity, we compared results
    obtained by analyzing the patient reported data to results of evidence-based studies.
    Overall, there was agreement on the relationship between back pain and being obese.
    In addition, there was agreement about which treatments were effective or had
    no benefit. The patients' ratings also point to new evidence that postural modification
    treatment is effective and that surgery is harmful to a large proportion of patients.

  abstract: In this article, we address transformations in global governance brought
    about by information and communication technologies (ICTs). Focusing on the specific
    domain of ‘gender-oriented communication governance’, we investigate online interactions
    among different kinds of actors active in promoting gender equity in and through
    the media. By tracing and analysing online issue networks, we investigate which
    actors are capable of influencing the framing of issues and of structuring discursive
    practices. From the analysis, different forms of power emerge, reflecting diverse
    modes of engaging in online interactions, where actors can operate as network
    ‘programmers’, ‘mobilizers’, or ‘switchers’. Our case study suggests that, often,
    old ways of conceiving actors' interactions accompany the implementation of new
    communication tools, while the availability of a pervasive networked infrastructure
    does not automatically translate into meaningful interactions among all relevant
    actors in a specific domain.

  abstract: Because people disproportionally follow defaults, both libertarian paternalists
    and marketers try to present options they want to promote as the default. However,
    setting certain defaults and thereby influencing current decisions, may also affect
    choices in later, similar decisions. In this paper we explore experimentally whether
    the default bias can be reinforced by providing good defaults. We show that people
    who faced better defaults in the past are more likely to follow defaults than
    people who faced random defaults, hurting their later performance. This malleability
    of the default bias explains certain marketing practices and serves as an insight
    for libertarian paternalists.

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is part of our daily lives. This technology shapes how people access information, interact with devices, share personal information, and even understand foreign languages. It also transforms how individuals and groups can be tracked and identified, and dramatically alters what kinds of information can be gleaned about people from their data. AI has the potential to revolutionise societies in positive ways. However, as with any scientific or technological advancement, there is a real risk that the use of new tools by states or corporations will have a negative impact on human rights. While AI impacts a plethora of rights, ARTICLE 19 and Privacy International are particularly concerned about the impact it will have on the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression and information. This scoping paper focuses on applications of ‘artificial narrow intelligence’: in particular, machine learning and its implications for human rights.

    The aim of the paper is fourfold:

    1. Present key technical definitions to clarify the debate;

    2. Examine key ways in which AI impacts the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy and outline key challenges;

    3. Review the current landscape of AI governance, including various existing legal, technical, and corporate frameworks and industry-led AI initiatives that are relevant to freedom of expression and privacy; and

    4. Provide initial suggestions for rights-based solutions which can be pursued by civil society organisations and other stakeholders in AI advocacy activities.

  abstract: Models for understanding and holding systems accountable have long rested
    upon ideals and logics of transparency. Being able to see a system is sometimes
    equated with being able to know how it works and govern it—a pattern that recurs
    in recent work about transparency and computational systems. But can “black boxes’
    ever be opened, and if so, would that ever be sufficient? In this article, we
    critically interrogate the ideal of transparency, trace some of its roots in scientific
    and sociotechnical epistemological cultures, and present 10 limitations to its
    application. We specifically focus on the inadequacy of transparency for understanding
    and governing algorithmic systems and sketch an alternative typology of algorithmic
    accountability grounded in constructive engagements with the limitations of transparency
    ideals.

  abstract: |-
    Fiscal policy refers to government actions regarding taxation and spending whilst monetary policy refers to central banking actions regarding the money supply and interest rates. These two main strands of economic policy determine and influence agricultural policy: laws and activities relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Here, we address the challenge of using heterogeneous public data sets and information (re)sources to aid the task of identifying technical, legal, financial, policy and other mechanisms capable of serving the diverse needs of practitioners of agroecology (primarily small holder farmers) and advocates of food sovereignty. We show how disparate material in the public domain and open source software tools can be integrated to tell a story of interest to audiences ranging from the general public to policy makers. Specifically, we employ a variety of financial and non-financial (“alternative”) data sets to explore the past, present and future of agriculture. In particular, we utilise some of the historical data released by the Bank of England in conjunction with other freely available data to paint a broad brush strokes picture of the impacts of Britain on the lands, agricultures, and economies of peoples and regions across the globe over five centuries. Our narrative considers three overarching and interconnected topics, (i) the trans-Atlantic slave trade and European Empires, (ii) 21st century large-scale land acquisitions, and (ii) traditional farming systems, agricultural biodiversity, and climate change. The three sets of background notes and data-driven visualisations – cartograms and timelines overlaid with event data – are autonomous yet interlinked and complemenary. By weaving together various historical, geographical, political, economic, and social threads, this triptych illustrates how the Bank of England is integral to the weft and warp national and global agriculture. We conclude by discussing how data science could contribute to two poorly investigated but critical important aspects of agricultural policy: the Community led London Plan, a grassroots effort to transform the whole food system in a large and complex city and the public infrastructure pertinent to the science, development, financing, and practice of agroecology.

    Keywords: Economic policy; agricultural policy; alternative data; Bank of England; trans-Atlantic slave trade; British Empire; Large-scale land acquisitions; Traditional farming systems; agricultural biodiversity; agroecology; Community-led London Plan; Visualisation

  abstract: 'As government agencies increasingly make public data available online,
    it provides opportunities to leverage such data for descriptive, predictive and
    prescriptive analytics. One domain where these technological capabilities are
    applicable is real-estate development and housing market domain. This domain is
    of interest to home buyers, investors and policy makers. Diverse and varying preferences
    of residents of a geography are latent behavioral factors that affect residential
    property prices. This paper describes a geographical area agnostic housing typology
    classifier for Baltimore City communities or neighborhoods. Further, it discussed
    correlation analysis and composite Vital Signs scores to characterize city population
    perceptions of different community development categories. These scores enable
    community clustering to investigate price disparity in comparable communities
    based on configurable categories and year-on-year trend analysis. Various visualization
    possibilities are discussed in conjunction with these approaches to make a case
    for interactive, visual exploration of geographical communities which may be extended
    to comparative analysis across geographies. '

  abstract: 'Policy co-creation holds promises to increase citizens’ trust in institutions
    and policy acceptance but no established approach has emerged yet. We propose
    a policy co-creation framework that leverages on complexity science and data science
    to involve both experts and stakeholders from the policy area, as well as the
    wider audience. Our iterative process consists of three stages: (i) identification
    of the main policy issues by a balanced expert group and launch of a non-technical
    stakeholder survey, (ii) analysis of stakeholders’ positions towards the issues
    via a Policy Network Map, and (iii) assessing the public leaning towards the issues
    using text mining techniques on big data from the social media. The output from
    stage two and three feeds back into a new round of assessments until a target
    level of support is reached. At this point, the expert group can formulate its
    final recommendations that will be used by policy makers to prepare a first policy
    proposal. We illustrate the feasibility of the proposed workflow by means of use
    cases from on-going and previous work.'

  abstract: The global landscape in the supply, co-creation and use of geospatial
    data is changing very rapidly with new satellites, sensors and mobile devices
    reconfiguring the traditional lines of demand and supply and the number of actors
    involved. In this paper we chart some of these technology-led developments and
    then focus on the opportunities they have created for the increased participation
    of the public in generating and contributing information for a wide range of uses,
    scientific and non. Not all this information is open or geospatial, but sufficiently
    large portions of it are to make it one of the most significant phenomena of the
    last decade. In fact, we argue that while satellite and sensors have exponentially
    increased the volumes of geospatial information available, the participation of
    the public is transformative because it expands the range of participants and
    stakeholders in society using and producing geospatial information, with opportunities
    for more direct participation in science, politics and social action.

  abstract: |-
    As a democratic country, the Philippines values citizen participation in ensuring that people's voices are heard and that they are part of important decision-making processes. ICT-mediated and enabled participation plays a particularly significant role in the Philippines, which is considered a leader in mobile telephony. However, despite high usage of ICTs, the country still lags behind its neighbours in terms of broadband infrastructure and Internet access, thus precluding the full realisation of ICT-mediated citizen engagement.

    Open data initiatives cannot succeed without a greater framework and culture of openness, which includes interoperability of systems in government. Another aspect of developing such culture of openness is changing the attitudes of both government and public towards open data, as well as developing their technical capacity in information management.

  abstract: We summarize the potential impact that the European Union's new General
    Data Protection Regulation will have on the routine use of machine learning algorithms.
    Slated to take effect as law across the EU in 2018, it will restrict automated
    individual decision-making (that is, algorithms that make decisions based on user-level
    predictors) which "significantly affect" users. The law will also effectively
    create a "right to explanation," whereby a user can ask for an explanation of
    an algorithmic decision that was made about them. We argue that while this law
    will pose large challenges for industry, it highlights opportunities for computer
    scientists to take the lead in designing algorithms and evaluation frameworks
    which avoid discrimination and enable explanation.

    (‘Marco Civil da Internet’) was the first initiative from the Federal Government
    to crowdsource the making of a Draft Bill of Law, using the internet to diversify
    the debate and invite participation from different stakeholders. This article
    provides an overview of the process behind the creation of such a law, emphasising
    the participatory process that resulted in the final wording of the law. Additionally,
    the article reflects upon some of the most relevant challenges for the enforcement
    of Brazil’s Internet Bill of Rights, as well as its international impact on future
    case law and in the legislative process.

  abstract: "Intelligence does not arise only in individual brains; it also arises
    in groups of individuals. This is collective intelligence: groups of individuals
    acting collectively in ways that seem intelligent. In recent years, a new kind
    of collective intelligence has emerged: interconnected groups of people and computers,
    collectively doing intelligent things. Today these groups are engaged in tasks
    that range from writing software to predicting the results of presidential elections.
    This volume reports on the latest research in the study of collective intelligence,
    laying out a shared set of research challenges from a variety of disciplinary
    and methodological perspectives. Taken together, these essays—by leading researchers
    from such fields as computer science, biology, economics, and psychology—lay the
    foundation for a new multidisciplinary field. \n\nEach essay describes the work
    on collective intelligence in a particular discipline—for example, economics and
    the study of markets; biology and research on emergent behavior in ant colonies;
    human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence; and cognitive psychology
    and the “wisdom of crowds” effect. Other areas in social science covered include
    social psychology, organizational theory, law, and communications. "

  abstract: 'Peatland fires and haze events in Indonesia are disasters with national
    and international implications. The phenomena lead to direct damage to local assets,
    as well as broader economic, social and environmental losses. Despite the extensive
    efforts of many organizations, the situation persists. At present, Indonesian
    disaster management authorities manage peatland fire and haze events based on
    satellite data as well as static data on population density and distribution.
    But to better support affected populations, the Government is looking for more
    timely data and more information on the dynamics of the disaster, especially the
    situation on the ground. Pulse Lab Jakarta’s Haze Gazer enhances disaster risk
    management efforts by providing real-time situational information from diverse
    data sources, including insights on the response strategies of haze-affected communities,
    in order to better protect vulnerable populations and the environment. '

    The Open Data for Development Programme facilitates strengthening coordination amongst open data initiatives to ensure they benefit citizens in developing countries. This includes improving the quantity and quality of open data supplied by governments, statistical offices, international development organizations and other relevant sources.

    This report, supported by the Open Data for Development Programme, builds on that effort to define a preliminary process and criteria for evaluation of open standards for potential application and adoption by the International Open Data Charter Secretariat.

  abstract: |-
    The impact of the digital revolution on our societies can be compared to the ripples caused by a stone thrown in water: spreading outwards and affecting a larger and larger part of our lives with every year that passes. One of the many effects of this revolution is the emergence of an already unprecedented amount of digital data that is accumulating exponentially. Moreover, a central affordance of digitization is the ability to distribute, share and collaborate, and we have thus seen an “open theme” gaining currency in recent years.

    These trends are reflected in the explosion of Open Data Initiatives (ODIs) around the world. However, while hundreds of national and local governments have established open data portals, there is a general feeling that these ODIs have not yet lived up to their true potential. This feeling is not without good reason; the recent Open Data Barometer report highlights that strong evidence on the impacts of open government data is almost universally lacking (Davies, 2013). This lack of evidence is disconcerting for government organizations that have already expended money on opening data, and might even result in the termination of some ODIs. This lack of evidence also raises some relevant questions regarding the nature of value generation in the context of free data and sharing of information over networks. Do we have the right methods, the right intellectual tools, to understand and reflect the value that is generated in such ecosystems?

  abstract: Empowering stakeholders in assessing the governments’ course of actions
    and contributing in transforming government structures to a more participatory
    and democratic form is not an easy task. New technologies and innovations help
    to this direction, and policy making is becoming more and more transparent, accountable
    and trusted if the inclusion of wide society masses in it is taken into account.
    What, however, society better understands as outcomes of policies is how the latter
    affects prosperity, as this is a visible impact on everyone’s life. Policy Compass
    is a platform, co-funded by the EC, that capitalises on prosperity and social
    indicators for assessing the impact of governmental policies, utilising open data
    sources associated to their calculation and providing to the public the opportunity
    to better understand policy decisions and how these might affect their lives.

  abstract: We estimated ideological preferences of 3.8 million Twitter users and,
    using a data set of nearly 150 million tweets concerning 12 political and nonpolitical
    issues, explored whether online communication resembles an “echo chamber” (as
    a result of selective exposure and ideological segregation) or a “national conversation.”
    We observed that information was exchanged primarily among individuals with similar
    ideological preferences in the case of political issues (e.g., 2012 presidential
    election, 2013 government shutdown) but not many other current events (e.g., 2013
    Boston Marathon bombing, 2014 Super Bowl). Discussion of the Newtown shootings
    in 2012 reflected a dynamic process, beginning as a national conversation before
    transforming into a polarized exchange. With respect to both political and nonpolitical
    issues, liberals were more likely than conservatives to engage in cross-ideological
    dissemination; this is an important asymmetry with respect to the structure of
    communication that is consistent with psychological theory and research bearing
    on ideological differences in epistemic, existential, and relational motivation.
    Overall, we conclude that previous work may have overestimated the degree of ideological
    segregation in social-media usage.

  abstract: To what extent can crowdsourcing help members of civil society overcome
    the democratic deficit in global environmental governance? In this paper, I evaluate
    the utility of crowdsourcing as a tool for participatory agenda-setting in the
    realm of post-2015 sustainable development policy. In particular, I analyze the
    descriptive representativeness (e.g., the degree to which participation mirrors
    the demographic attributes of non-state actors comprising global civil society)
    of participants in two United Nations orchestrated crowdsourcing processes—the
    MY World survey and e-discussions regarding environmental sustainability. I find
    that there exists a perceptible demographic imbalance among contributors to the
    MY World survey and considerable dissonance between the characteristics of participants
    in the e-discussions and those whose voices were included in the resulting summary
    report. The results suggest that although crowdsourcing may present an attractive
    technological approach to expand participation in global governance, ultimately
    the representativeness of that participation and the legitimacy of policy outputs
    depend on the manner in which contributions are solicited and filtered by international
    institutions.

    The roles of intermediaries in open data is insu ciently explored; open data intermediaries are often presented as single and simple linkages between open data supply and use. This synthesis research paper o ers a more socially nuanced approach to open data intermediaries using the theoretical framework of Bourdieu’s social model, in particular, his concept of species of capital as informing social interaction. The study is based on the analysis of a sample of cases from the Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing Countries Project (ODDC) project. Data on intermediaries were extracted from the ODDC reports according to a working de nition of an open data intermediary presented in this paper, and with a focus on how intermediaries link actors in an open data
    supply chain. The study found that open data supply chains may comprise multiple intermediaries and that multiple forms of capital may be required to connect the supply and use of open data. Because no single intermediary necessarily has all the capital available to link e ectively to all sources of power in a  eld, multiple intermediaries with complementary con gurations of capital are more likely to connect between power nexuses. This study concludes that consideration needs to be given to the presence of multiple intermediaries in an open data ecosystem, each of whom may possess di erent forms of capital to enable the use and unlock the potential impact of open data.

  abstract: In this paper, we shine a light on the opposite effect, challenging conventional
    assumptions about public information. The paper reports on a series of studies,
    which probe attitudes and expectations regarding information that has been deemed
    public. Public records established through the historical practice of federal,
    state, and local agencies, as a case in point, are afforded little privacy protection,
    or possibly none at all. Motivated by progressive digitization and creation of
    online portals through which these records have been made publicly accessible
    our work underscores the need for more concentrated and nuanced privacy assessments,
    even more urgent in the face of vigorous open data initiatives, which call on
    federal, state, and local agencies to provide access to government records in
    both human and machine readable forms. Within a stream of research suggesting
    possible guard rails for open data initiatives, our work, guided by the theory
    of contextual integrity, provides insight into the factors systematically shaping
    individuals’ expectations and normative judgments concerning appropriate uses
    of and terms of access to information.

  abstract: 'SeeClickFix began in 2009 when founder and present-CEO Ben Berkowitz
    spotted a piece of graffiti in his New Haven, Connecticut, neighborhood. After
    calling numerous departments at city hall in a bid to have the graffiti removed,
    Berkowitz felt no closer to fixing the problem. Confused and frustrated, his emotions
    resonated with what many citizens in real-existing democracies feel today (Manning
    2015): we see problems in public and want to fix them but can''t. This all too
    habitual inability for "common people'' to fix problems they have to live with
    on a day-to-day basis is a prelude to the irascible citizen (White 2012), which,
    according to certain scholars (e.g., Dean 1960; Lee 2009), is itself a prelude
    to political apathy and a citizen''s alienation from specific political institutions. '

  abstract: 'Urban blight is a domino effect phenomenon: properties first fall into
    disrepair, then land values decline, and finally home abandonment and vacancy
    follows. This effect spreads from one home to another in the neighborhood, depressing
    values of nearby properties [8]. In partnership with the City of Cincinnati Office
    of Performance and Data Analytics and their Department of Buildings & Inspections,
    we used geographical data from the city and historical data on home inspections
    to train a Machine Learning model to provide proactive suggestions for property
    inspections targeted at catching blight early. Our best model reaches a precision
    of 70% for the top 6,000 predictions. This is a significant improvement over the
    discovery rate of the current approach, where 60% (in 2015) of citizen complaints
    result in the discovery of code violations. While our model can have a huge impact
    in tackling the blight problem, without field validation, the model can potentially
    have unintended consequences and ethical issues, such risks are being taken into
    account for the development of the project.'

    The Open Government National Action Plan (NAP) development and roll-out processes analysed in this paper reveal Uruguay’s effort to enable new ways of agency in the digital era. NAPs are developed as a result of a political context where the government seeks to engage its citizens in order to know their needs and improve their living conditions. Specifically this research examines the creation and implementation of the two-yearly Open Government Partnership National Action Plans (OGPNAP), for the years 2012–2014, 2014-2016, and 2016-2018.

    Giddens’ structuration framework has been used here to discuss the specific shifts in structures of meaning, norms and power that have occurred in the course of the OGP-NAP consultations and negotiations between government agencies and citizens. The authors discuss the creation of new norms, values and rules in state-citizen engagement. They also consider changes in cultures of participation and distribution of power and the disruptive effects these have had for citizenship.

  abstract: The Social Dynamics of Open Data is a collection of peer reviewed papers
    presented at the 2nd Open Data Research Symposium (ODRS) held in Madrid, Spain,
    on 5 October 2016. Research is critical to developing a more rigorous and fine-combed
    analysis not only of why open data is valuable, but how it is valuable and under
    what specific conditions. The objective of the Open Data Research Symposium and
    the subsequent collection of chapters published here is to build such a stronger
    evidence base. This base is essential to understanding what open data’s impacts
    have been to date, and how positive impacts can be enabled and amplified. Consequently,
    common to the majority of chapters in this collection is the attempt by the authors
    to draw on existing scientific theories, and to apply them to open data to better
    explain the socially embedded dynamics that account for open data’s successes
    and failures in contributing to a more equitable and just society.

  abstract: 'Drawing on the insights of some of the world’s leading authorities in
    public policy analysis, this important book offers a distinct and critical showcase
    of emerging forms of discovery for policy-making. Chapter by chapter this expert
    group of social scientists showcase their chosen method or approach, showing the
    context, the method’s key features and how it can be applied in practice, including
    the scope and limitations of its application and value to policy makers. Arguing
    that it is not just econometric analysis, cost benefit or surveys that can do
    policy work, the contributors demonstrate a range of other methods that can provide
    evidenced-based policy insights and how they can help facilitate progressive policy
    outcomes. The book will be ideal for upper level undergraduate students as well
    as Public Policy post-graduates, and can be used as the basis of an intensive
    learning experience for policy makers. - See more at: http://policypress.co.uk/evidence-based-policy-making-in-the-social-sciences#book-detail-tabs-stison-block-content-1-0-tab0'

  abstract: The process of political decision making is often complex and tedious.
    The policy process consists of multiple steps, most of them are highly iterative.
    In addition, different stakeholder groups are involved in political decision making
    and contribute to the process. A series of textual documents accompanies the process.
    Examples are official documents, discussions, scientific reports, external reviews,
    newspaper articles, or economic white papers. Experts from the political domain
    report that this plethora of textual documents often exceeds their ability to
    keep track of the entire policy process. We present PolicyLine, a visualization
    system that supports different stakeholder groups in overview-and-detail tasks
    for large sets of textual documents in the political decision making process.
    In a longitudinal design study conducted together with domain experts in political
    decision making, we identified missing analytical functionality on the basis of
    a problem and domain characterization. In an iterative design phase, we created
    PolicyLine in close collaboration with the domain experts. Finally, we present
    the results of three evaluation rounds, and reflect on our collaborative visualization
    system.

  abstract: 'This paper provides the first experimental evaluation of the participatory
    budgeting model showing that it increased public participation in the process
    of public decision making, increased local tax revenues collection, channeled
    larger fractions of public budgets to services stated as top priorities by citizens,
    and increased satisfaction levels with public services. These effects, however,
    were found only when the model was implemented in already-mature administratively
    and politically decentralized local governments. The findings highlight the importance
    of initial conditions with respect to the decentralization context for the success
    of participatory governance. - See more at: http://publications.iadb.org/handle/11319/6699?locale-attribute=en#sthash.CjXBEQ5C.dpuf'

  abstract: |-
    Reproducibility has long been a tenet of science but has been challenging to achieve — we learned this the hard way when our old approaches proved inadequate to efficiently reproduce our own work. Here we describe how several free software tools have fundamentally upgraded our approach to collaborative research, making our entire workflow more transparent and streamlined. By describing specific tools and how we incrementally began using them for the Ocean Health Index project, we hope to encourage others in the scientific community to do the same—so we can all produce better science in less time.

    Science, now more than ever, demands reproducibility, collaboration and effective communication to strengthen public trust and effectively inform policy. Recent high-profile difficulties in reproducing and repeating scientific studies have put the spotlight on psychology and cancer biology, but it is widely acknowledged that reproducibility challenges persist across scientific disciplines. Environmental scientists face potentially unique challenges in achieving goals of transparency and reproducibility because they rely on vast amounts of data spanning natural, economic and social sciences that create semantic and synthesis issues exceeding those for most other disciplines. Furthermore, proposed environmental solutions can be complex, controversial and resource intensive, increasing the need for scientists to work transparently and efficiently with data to foster understanding and trust.

    Environmental scientists are expected to work effectively with ever-increasing quantities of highly heterogeneous data even though they are seldom formally trained to do so. This was recently highlighted by a survey of 704 US National Science Foundation principal investigators in the biological sciences, which found training in data skills to be the largest unmet need15. Without training, scientists tend to develop their own bespoke workarounds to keep pace, but with this comes wasted time struggling to create their own conventions for managing, wrangling and versioning data. If done haphazardly or without a clear protocol, these efforts are likely to result in work that is not reproducible—by the scientist's own ‘future self’ or by anyone else12. As a team of environmental scientists tasked with reproducing our own science annually, we experienced this struggle first-hand. When we began our project, we worked with data in the same way as we always had, taking extra care to make our methods reproducible for planned future re-use. But when we began to reproduce our workflow a second time and repeat our methods with updated data, we found our approaches to reproducibility were insufficient. However, by borrowing philosophies, tools, and workflows primarily created for software development, we have been able to dramatically improve the ability for ourselves and others to reproduce our science, while also reducing the time involved to do so: the result is better science in less time.

  abstract: Public policy and management problems have been described as poorly defined,
    messy, squishy, unstructured, intractable, and wicked. In a word, they are complex.
    This book illustrates the development and use of simulation models designed to
    capture some of the complexity inherent in the formulation, management, and implementation
    of policies aimed at addressing such problems. Simulation models have long existed
    at the fringes of policy inquiry but are not yet considered an essential component
    of the policy analyst’s toolkit. However, this situation is likely to change because
    with improvements in computational power and software, simulation is now easier
    to include in the standard repertoire of research tools available for discovery
    and decision support. This volume provides both a conceptual rationale for using
    simulations to inform public policy and a practical introduction to how such models
    might be constructed and employed. The focus of these papers is on the uses of
    simulation to gain understanding and inform policy decisions and action. Techniques
    represented in this volume include Monte Carlo simulation, system dynamics and
    agent based modeling.

  abstract: Politicians have high expectations for commercial open data use. Yet,
    companies appear to challenge the assumption that open data can be used to create
    competitive advantage, since any company can access open data and since open data
    use requires scarce resources. In this paper we examine commercial open data use
    for creating competitive advantage from the perspective of Resource Based Theory
    (RBT) and Resource Dependency Theory (RDT). Based on insights from a scenario,
    interviews and a survey and from RBT and RDT as a reference theory, we derive
    seven propositions. Our study suggests that the generation of competitive advantage
    with open data requires a company to have in-house capabilities and resources
    for open data use. The actual creation of competitive advantage might not be simple.
    The propositions also draw attention to the accomplishment of unique benefits
    for a company through the combination of internal and external resources. Recommendations
    for further research include testing the propositions.

  abstract: This research examines the conditions under which Chinese central government
    ministries and provincial governments implement online consultation, a prominent
    instrument of governance reform in which officials provide interested parties
    with opportunities to offer feedback on proposed public policies. The research
    assembles original data regarding the online consultation practices of more than
    one hundred central government ministries and provincial governments. The analysis
    demonstrates that online consultation practices are more developed in provincial
    governments than central government ministries. Across organizational contexts,
    online consultation is more advanced in the disclosure of proposed policies than
    in the circulation of feedback submitted in response to draft laws and regulations.
    Finally, online consultation is primarily utilized by organizations with substantial
    resources, as well as organizations operating in environments not characterized
    by fundamental political sensitivities. These results are consistent with the
    expectation that although online consultation increases information disclosure
    and public participation in government decision making, such reforms are indicative
    not of the end of authoritarianism but rather the resilience of the Chinese Communist
    Party.

  abstract: Pinning down the role of social ties in the decision to protest has been
    notoriously elusive, largely due to data limitations. The era of social media
    and its global use by protesters offers an unprecedented opportunity to observe
    real-time social ties and online behavior, though often without an attendant measure
    of real-world behavior. We collect data on Twitter activity during the 2015 Charlie
    Hebdo protests in Paris which, unusually, record both real-world protest attendance
    and high-resolution network structure. We specify a theory of participation in
    which an individual’s decision depends on her exposure to others’ intentions,
    and network position determines exposure. Our findings are strong and consistent
    with this theory, showing that, relative to comparable Twitter users, protesters
    are significantly more connected to one another via direct, indirect, triadic,
    and reciprocated ties. These results offer the first large-scale empirical support
    for the claim that social network structure influences protest participation.

  abstract: |-
    In February 2016, 55 researchers and practitioners met in Manila to discuss the role of technology in transforming governance.

    It was a fast-moving conversation, with discussions on what 'transformative' means for people actually implementing projects. It included visits to a series of organisations in the Philippines to help challenge what it is we all think we know, and find out how others might be doing it better.

    This report shares some of what participants learned from discussions, interviews, field visits and analysis during the workshop. It is a conversation on partnership, engagement and technology, and it questions how we value or challenge ideas of open data and open governance in our work.

  abstract: We study innovation contests with asymmetric information and identical
    contestants, where contestants’ efforts and innate abilities generate inventions
    of varying qualities. The designer offers a reward to the contestant achieving
    the highest quality and receives the revenue generated by the innovation. We characterize
    the equilibrium behavior, outcomes and payoffs for both nondiscriminatory and
    discriminatory (where the reward is contestant-dependent) contests. We derive
    conditions under which the designer obtains a larger payoff when using a discriminatory
    contest and describe settings where these conditions are satisfied.

  abstract: The present book highlights studies that show how smart cities promote
    urban economic development. The book surveys the state of the art of Smart City
    Economic Development through a literature survey. The book uses 13 in depth city
    research case studies in 10 countries such as the North America, Europe, Africa
    and Asia to explain how a smart economy changes the urban spatial system and vice
    versa. This book focuses on exploratory city studies in different countries, which
    investigate how urban spatial systems adapt to the specific needs of smart urban
    economy. The theory of smart city economic development is not yet entirely understood
    and applied in metropolitan regional plans. Smart urban economies are largely
    the result of the influence of ICT applications on all aspects of urban economy,
    which in turn changes the land-use system. It points out that the dynamics of
    smart city GDP creation takes ‘different paths,’ which need further empirical
    study, hypothesis testing and mathematical modelling. Although there are hypotheses
    on how smart cities generate wealth and social benefits for nations, there are
    no significant empirical studies available on how they generate urban economic
    development through urban spatial adaptation. This book with 13 cities research
    studies is one attempt to fill in the gap in knowledge base.

    A national administration is dependent on its archives and registers, for many purposes, such as tax collection, enforcement of law, economic governance, and welfare services. Today, these services are based on large digital infrastructures, which grow organically in volume and scope. Building on a critical realist approach we investigate a particularly successful infrastructure in Norway called Altinn, and ask: what are the evolutionary mechanisms for a successful “government as a platform”?

    We frame our study with two perspectives; a historical institutional perspective that traces the roots of Altinn back to the Middle Ages, and an architectural perspective that allows for a more detailed analysis of the consequences of digitalization and the role of platforms. We offer two insights from our study: we identify three evolutionary mechanisms of national registers, and we discuss a future scenario of government platforms as “digital commons”.

    As the Internet grows more sophisticated, it is creating new threats to democracy. Social media companies such as Facebook can sort us ever more efficiently into groups of the like-minded, creating echo chambers that amplify our views. It's no accident that on some occasions, people of different political views cannot even understand each other. It's also no surprise that terrorist groups have been able to exploit social media to deadly effect.

    Welcome to the age of #Republic.

    In this revealing book, Cass Sunstein, the New York Times bestselling author of Nudge and The World According to Star Wars, shows how today's Internet is driving political fragmentation, polarization, and even extremism—and what can be done about it.

  abstract: 'Behavioral nudges are everywhere: calorie counts on menus, automated
    text reminders to encourage medication adherence, a reminder bell when a driver’s
    seatbelt isn’t fastened. Designed to help people make better health choices, these
    reminders have become so commonplace that they often go unnoticed. In Nudging
    Health, forty-five experts in behavioral science and health policy from across
    academia, government, and private industry come together to explore whether and
    how these tools are effective in improving health outcomes. Behavioral science
    has swept the fields of economics and law through the study of nudges, cognitive
    biases, and decisional heuristics—but it has only recently begun to impact the
    conversation on health care. Nudging Health wrestles with some of the thorny philosophical
    issues, legal limits, and conceptual questions raised by behavioral science as
    applied to health law and policy. The volume frames the fundamental issues surrounding
    health nudges by addressing ethical questions. Does cost-sharing for health expenditures
    cause patients to make poor decisions? Is it right to make it difficult for people
    to opt out of having their organs harvested for donation when they die? Are behavioral
    nudges paternalistic? The contributors examine specific applications of behavioral
    science, including efforts to address health care costs, improve vaccination rates,
    and encourage better decision-making by physicians. They wrestle with questions
    regarding the doctor-patient relationship and defaults in healthcare while engaging
    with larger, timely questions of healthcare reform. Nudging Health is the first
    multi-voiced assessment of behavioral economics and health law to span such a
    wide array of issues—from the Affordable Care Act to prescription drugs.'

  abstract: |-
    Federal rulemaking has traditionally been understood as a text-bound, technocratic process. However, as this Article is the first to uncover, rulemaking stakeholders — including agencies, the President and members of the public — are now deploying politically tinged visuals to push their agendas at every stage of high-stakes, often virulently controversial, rulemakings. Rarely do these visual contributions appear in the official rulemaking record, which remains defined by dense text, lengthy cost-benefit analyses, and expert reports. Perhaps as a result, scholars have overlooked the phenomenon we identify here: the emergence of a visual rulemaking universe that is splashing images, GIFs, and videos across social media channels. While this new universe, which we call “visual rulemaking,” might appear to be wholly distinct from the textual rulemaking universe on which administrative law has long focused, the two are not in fact distinct. Visual politics are seeping into the technocracy.

    This Article argues that visual rulemaking is a good thing. It furthers fundamental regulatory values, including transparency and political accountability. It may also facilitate participation by more diverse stakeholders — not merely regulatory insiders who are well-equipped to navigate dense text. Yet we recognize that visual rulemaking poses risks. Visual appeals may undermine the expert-driven foundation of the regulatory state, and some uses may threaten or outright violate key legal doctrines, including the Administrative Procedure Act and longstanding prohibitions on agency lobbying and propaganda. Nonetheless, we conclude that administrative law theory and doctrine ultimately can and should welcome this robust new visual rulemaking culture.

    This paper considers how crowdsourcing applications and crowdsourced data are currently being applied, as well as potential new uses for active transportation research and planning efforts of various types.

    The objectives of this white paper are to review existing crowdsourced bicycle and pedestrian data resources and crowdsourcing tools; discuss potential planning implementations of crowdsourced data for a sample of bicycle and pedestrian project types; and provide examples of how crowdsourcing is currently being used to inform decision-making. Potential issues related to crowdsourced data are also considered (e.g., quality, privacy concerns, participation rates, bias). The research presented here highlights a decreasing skepticism over the quality of volunteered, user-generated data provided by amateurs (as opposed to professionals) in light of a desire to open the lines of communication between the planning world and those affected by planning decisions, directly addressing (rather than being discouraged by) data limitations. The initiatives surrounding progressive data collection, management, and analysis are further reflected in the numerous conferences, meetups, and other events fostering collaboration between planners, developers, data scientists and others interested in applying critical thought and innovation in planning.

    While this paper reviews existing crowdsourcing techniques and their current applications in planning, the pace of technological change and rate of adoption in planning indicates that planners will continue to develop and apply innovative approaches like crowdsourcing in response to continually changing community needs. This paper focuses on examples of current uses of crowdsourced data, crowdsourcing data suggestions, and data considerations.

  abstract: 'Kennedy considers whether social media (and other) data mining can be
    used in ways that make a positive contribution to social life by focusing on two
    fields in which actors might think of themselves as ‘doing good with data’: (1)
    academic social media data mining and (2) data activism, such as open data initiatives,
    data art and data visualisation, campaigns for better data legislation and movements
    which seek to evade dataveillance. These groups seek to implement data-related
    arrangements which enable citizens and publics. Kennedy outlines some of the criticisms
    that have been levelled at academic and activist data initiatives and argues that,
    while there are ways in which they can both be considered problematic, they are
    not only problematic: they also serve to open up spaces for alternative and better
    uses of (social media) data mining.'

  abstract: Many countries around the world have joined the open data movement. Data
    is being published for a various number of reasons which include for the public
    to reuse, to create a more efficient government, and to increase transparency.
    Recent development in this field is that the data published is expected to be
    in machine readable format. In general, there is a lack in guidelines to regulate
    and help the process of opening data. Many countries are in different stages in
    developing these guidelines. Indonesia is an example of a country just beginning
    to join the open data movement. A field of study that is lacking is about how
    countries can learn from each other in developing the necessary guidelines. Being
    in the early stages of development, Indonesia can especially benefit from research
    in this area. A complex comparison of open data policies is conducted in this
    research to provide a basis for drawing conclusions and recommendations for the
    open data policy in Indonesia. For this study, five different countries that are
    in different stages of development in their open data initiatives are explored
    which results in an extensive list of findings. These countries include the United
    States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Kenya and Indonesia. For the design of the
    framework, literature and case studies are conducted. The case studies are in
    the form of interviews with eight respondents involved in open data in each country.
    First, it is identified what aspects influence the uneven development of open
    data. Second, lessons that are relevant for Indonesia based on the many similarities
    and differences are identified. As the scientific contribution of the research,
    this framework and comparison is given because there is currently lacking research
    in this area. It was concluded that Indonesia can synthesize a number of lessons
    from the comparison that comprises a combination of elements that were presented
    as findings from each of the countries. The lessons that were developed include
    suggestions for a more robust legal framework, the creation of an ecosystem between
    data publishers and data users, the development of stronger IT and organizational
    support for open data, and the launch of initiatives that use open data at the
    district government levels. Interestingly, from the study, it suggests that the
    focus of the policies for countries in the developing stages are more related
    to the release of data from the publishers and less on the technical processes
    that are involved with opening the data. Other interesting results that were founded
    from the study suggest that the difference between the countries are influenced
    by specific forces and counter forces in the area of open government and also
    from the existence of individuals that highly advocate for the development of
    open data in that country. So, the practical contribution of this research is
    the lessons that each of the countries can derive from the comparison and also
    the specific lessons that are designed for Indonesia’s open data policy both to
    reap the identified benefits of opening data. Further to this research, there
    is a possibility to conduct research on further comparisons for a more robust
    and comprehensive learning process. Comparisons can be conducted on different
    countries about open data policies or about different aspects of open data itself.
    Another possibility is to create lessons for all countries involved in this current
    study.

  abstract: Digital technologies have spread rapidly in much of the world. Digital
    dividends—the broader development benefits from using these technologies—have
    lagged behind. In many instances digital technologies have boosted growth, expanded
    oppor- tunities, and improved service delivery. Yet their aggregate impact has
    fallen short and is unevenly distributed. For digital technologies to benefit
    everyone everywhere requires closing the remaining digital divide, especially
    in internet access. But greater digital adoption will not be enough. To get the
    most out of the digital revolution, countries also need to work on the “analog
    complements”—by strengthening regulations that ensure competition among businesses,
    by adapting workers’ skills to the demands of the new economy, and by ensuring
    that institutions are accountable.

    Purpose
    – The purpose of this paper is to develop a method for better analyzing the utility and impact of new technologies on smart cities. The authors have designed a tool that will evaluate new technologies according to a three-pronged scoring system that considers the impact on physical space, environmental issues and city residents. The purpose of this tool is to be used by city planners as part of a strategic approach to the implementation of a smart city initiative in order to reduce unnecessary public spending and ensure the optimal allocation of city resources.

    Design/methodology/approach
    – The information and communication technologies that manage and transform twenty-first century cities must be reviewed, analyzing their impact on new social behaviors that shape the spaces and means of communication, developing a new methodology and setting the basis for an analysis matrix to score the different and technologies that affect a smart city environment.

    Research limitations/implications
    – Traditional technological scenarios have been challenged, and smart cities have become the center of urban competitiveness. A lack of clarity has been detected in the way of describing what smart cities are, and the authors try to establish a methodology for urban policy makers to do so. As a dynamic process that affects several aspects, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed solution further.

    Practical implications
    – After a review of the state-of-the-art, the authors found that there are no existing systems for assessing smart city strategies regarding new, evolving technologies. The methodology attempts to design a simple tool to bring urban developers and policy makers closer to the technology and to have an instrument with which to compare different alternatives before choosing one.

    Social implications
    – Helped by new technologies, citizens are the ones who have the power to define new urban scenarios. For this reason the methodology the authors propose must have citizens and their needs as the ultimate reference, considering all the social, physical and environmental effects on people before selecting a new technology for urban strategies.

    Originality/value
    – This paper fulfills an identified need to study how new technologies could affect urban scenarios before being applied, developing an analysis system in the form of a matrix to be used by urban planners and policy makers to decide how best to use them.

  abstract: This book provides insights on how emerging technosciences come together
    with new forms of governance and ethical questioning. Combining science and technologies
    and ethics approaches, it looks at the emergence of three key technoscientific
    domains - body enhancement technologies, biometrics and technologies for the production
    of space -exploring how human bodies and minds, the movement of citizens and space
    become matters of technoscientific governance. The emergence of new and digital
    technologies pose new challenges for representative democracy and existing forms
    of citizenship. As citizens encounter and have to adapt to technological change
    in their everyday life, new forms of conviviality and contestation emerge. This
    book is a key reference for scholars interested in the governance of emerging
    technosciences in the fields of science and technology studies and ethics.

  abstract: 'With the prevalence of smartphones, new ways of engaging citizens and
    stakeholders in urban planning and governance are emerging. The technologies in
    smartphones allow citizens to act as sensors of their environment, producing and
    sharing rich spatial data useful for new types of collaborative governance set-ups.
    Data derived from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) can support accessible,
    transparent, democratic, inclusive, and locally-based governance situations of
    interest to planners, citizens, politicians, and scientists. However, there are
    still uncertainties about how to actually conduct this in practice. This study
    explores how social media VGI can be used to document spatial tendencies regarding
    citizens’ uses and perceptions of urban nature with relevance for urban green
    space governance. Via the hashtag #sharingcph, created by the City of Copenhagen
    in 2014, VGI data consisting of geo-referenced images were collected from Instagram,
    categorised according to their content and analysed according to their spatial
    distribution patterns. The results show specific spatial distributions of the
    images and main hotspots. Many possibilities and much potential of using VGI for
    generating, sharing, visualising and communicating knowledge about citizens’ spatial
    uses and preferences exist, but as a tool to support scientific and democratic
    interaction, VGI data is challenged by practical, technical and ethical concerns.
    More research is needed in order to better understand the usefulness and application
    of this rich data source to governance.'

  abstract: |-
    Governments around the world are looking for ways to nurture innovative businesses, as a way of solving some of their most urgent economic and societal challenges. Many seek to do this by setting up national innovation agencies: institutions that provide financial and other support to catalyse or drive private sector innovation. Yet we still know relatively little about the range of approaches that these agencies take, what programmes and instruments are likely to work best in a given context, and how to assess their long-term impact.

    We have been investigating these questions by studying a diverse group selection of innovation agencies in ten different countries. Our aim has been to improve understanding of the range of existing institutional models and to learn more about their design, evolution and effectiveness. In doing so, we have developed a broad framework to help policymakers think about the set of choices and options they face in the design and management of an innovation agency.

    This report is the most comprehensive comparative study of innovation agencies that we know of to date. However, we are keen to develop this analysis through further collaboration with policymakers and experts around the world. Please do get in touch with comments and suggestions.

    Facing especially wicked problems, social sector organizations are searching for powerful new methods to understand and address them. *Design Thinking for the Greater Good* goes in depth on both the *how* of using new tools and the *why*. As a way to reframe problems, ideate solutions, and iterate toward better answers, design thinking is already well-established in the commercial world. Through ten stories of struggles and successes in fields such as health care, education, agriculture, transportation, social services, and security, the authors show how collaborative creativity can shake up even the most entrenched bureaucracies - and provide a practical roadmap for readers to implement these tools.

    The authors explore how major agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services and the Transportation and Security Administration in the United States, as well as organizations in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have instituted principles of design thinking. In each case, these groups have used the tools of design thinking to reduce risk, manage change, use resources more effectively, bridge the communication gap between parties, and manage the competing demands of diverse stakeholders. Along the way, they have improved the quality of their products and enhanced the experiences of those they serve. These strategies are acecssible to analytical and creative types alike, and their benefits extend throughout an organization. This book will help today's leaders and thinkers implement these practices in their own pursuit of creative solutions that are both innovative and achievable.

  abstract: |-
    The way organizations use data use is affecting consumer trust, and that trust affects not just a brand’s reputation, but its business performance as well. As a result, chief executives who wish to sustain the trust of their customers and constituents must take a hard look at how their organizations collect and use customer data, and the effect of those practices on customer relationships, reputation, risk and revenue.

    This report by Altimeter Group analyst Susan Etlinger lays out key drivers and principles for ethical data use. It discusses emerging best practices, and—most importantly—a pragmatic framework that organizations can use to earn—and build—the trust of customers and consumers. This framework lists the questions that need to be asked at each stage of collecting and analyzing data, helping brands earn the trust of their customers, and safeguarding against both legal and ethical transgressions.

  abstract: "In the vein of H Is for Hawk and the work of Rebecca Solnit and Elizabeth
    Kolbert—a masterful consideration of the profound, urgent necessity to bear witness
    to life and loss\n \n Here is a wide-ranging adventure in becoming a citizen scientist
    by an award-winning writer and environmental thought leader. As Mary Ellen Hannibal
    wades into tide pools, follows hawks, and scours mountains to collect data on
    threatened species, she discovers the power of a heroic cast of volunteers—and
    the makings of what may be our last, best hope in slowing an unprecedented mass
    extinction.\n \n Digging deeply, Hannibal traces today’s tech-enabled citizen
    science movement to its roots: the centuries-long tradition of amateur observation
    by writers and naturalists. Prompted by her novelist father’s sudden death, she
    also examines her own past—and discovers a family legacy of looking closely at
    the world. With unbending zeal for protecting the planet, she then turns her gaze
    to the wealth of species left to fight for.\n \n Combining original reporting,
    meticulous research, and memoir in impassioned prose, Citizen Scientist is a literary
    event, a blueprint for action, and the story of how one woman rescued herself
    from an odyssey of loss—with a new kind of science."

  abstract: "What motivates people to contact their local governments with reports
    about street light outages, potholes, graffiti, and other deteriorations in public
    spaces? Current efforts to improve government interactions with constituents operate
    on the premise that citizens who make such reports are motivated by broad civic
    values. In contrast, our recent research demonstrates that such citizens are primarily
    motivated by territoriality – that is, attachments to the spaces where they live.
    Our research focuses on Boston’s “311 system,” which provides telephone hotlines
    and web channels through which constituents can request non-emergency government
    services.\n \n Although our study focuses on 311 users in Boston, it holds broader
    implications for more than 400 U.S. municipalities that administer similar systems.
    And our results encourage a closer look at the drivers of citizen participation
    in many “coproduction programs” – programs that involve people in the design and
    implementation of government services. Currently, 311 is just one example of government
    efforts to use technology to involve constituents in joint efforts."

  abstract: Policy informatics is addressing governance challenges and their consequences,
    which span the seeming inability of governments to solve complex problems and
    the disaffection of people from their governments. Policy informatics seeks approaches
    that enable our governance systems to address increasingly complex challenges
    and to meet the rising expectations of people to be full participants in their
    communities. This book approaches these challenges by applying a combination of
    the latest American and European approaches in applying complex systems modeling,
    crowdsourcing, participatory platforms and citizen science to explore complex
    governance challenges in domains that include education, environment, and health.

  abstract: 'This paper explores the value of user-generated big data for urban planning
    of active and healthy public spaces. The research is situated in and focuses on
    Eindhoven, an innovative and sports-minded city in the Netherlands. Based on running
    data collected by two popular apps in The Netherlands and Belgium, we present
    three iterations that set out to gain understanding in what factors define good
    running environments. The first iteration uses data visualisation techniques to
    get geographic insight in our data, to identify running hotspots and other points
    of interest for further analysis. The second iteration uses a mixed method approach
    to combine running data with qualitatively scored environmental characteristics
    of the selected locations from iteration one to identify possible influencers
    of the attraction of these areas for runners. As it became clear that this approach
    requested further scaling, in the third iteration we explore how we can come to
    factors that are worth scoring. Creating a larger set of locations with a reduced
    number of variables allowed for more substantial statistical analysis. This approach
    helped to provide an initial insight in the relevance of some of the environmental
    factors for optimised running climates. '

  abstract: Dozens—and possibly hundreds—of online platforms have been built in the
    past decade to facilitate speci c forms of civic engagement. Unconnected to each
    other, let alone an integrated system easy for citizens to use, these platforms
    cannot begin to realize their full potential. The author proposes a massive collaborative
    project to build an integrated platform called, tongue squarely in cheek, “The
    Democracy Machine.” The Machine draws on public energy and ideas, mixing those
    into concrete policy advice, in uencing government decision making, and creating
    a feedback loop that helps of cials and citizens track progress together as they
    continuously turn the pol- icymaking crank. This online system could help to harmonize
    civic leaders, vocal and marginalized citizens, and government. Democracy’s need
    for ongoing public consul- tation would fuel the Machine, which would, in turn,
    generate the empowered delib- eration and public legitimacy that government needs
    to make tough policy decisions.

  abstract: |-
    Nepal’s political, social, economic, technical, social and organisational context presents a complex environment of
    opportunities and challenges for the further emergence of open data in Nepal. With the prevalence of a vibrant
    civil society familiar with advocating for transparency and accountability, emerging government support, a
    governance-friendly legislative framework in place, and a burgeoning community interested in the issue, open data
    has a solid potential to strengthen the transparency and accountability regime and to deliver effective
    development outcomes. However, Nepal ranks low on many of the social and economic indicators reviewed, and it
    is unclear how open data will play out in an environment with limited financial resources for data infrastructure
    and sharing, and with high levels of inequality. Among other issues, the low internet penetration, lack of open data
    policy, political and bureaucratic resistance to innovation, limited financial resources, high levels of corruption,
    culture of secrecy, limited demand for open data and lack of collaboration between open data and the Right To
    Information legislative framework form a range of bottlenecks constraining the growth of open data in Nepal.
    Despite this, there is a committed and skilled group of Nepali technical and thematic experts who are proactively
    trying to improve Nepal’s supply of open data, stimulate demand for that data, and equip an ecosystem of actors
    with the skills to use that data.

  abstract: This theme issue has the founding ambition of landscaping data ethics
    as a new branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related to
    data (including generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination, sharing
    and use), algorithms (including artificial intelligence, artificial agents, machine
    learning and robots) and corresponding practices (including responsible innovation,
    programming, hacking and professional codes), in order to formulate and support
    morally good solutions (e.g. right conducts or right values). Data ethics builds
    on the foundation provided by computer and information ethics but, at the same
    time, it refines the approach endorsed so far in this research field, by shifting
    the level of abstraction of ethical enquiries, from being information-centric
    to being data-centric. This shift brings into focus the different moral dimensions
    of all kinds of data, even data that never translate directly into information
    but can be used to support actions or generate behaviours, for example. It highlights
    the need for ethical analyses to concentrate on the content and nature of computational
    operations—the interactions among hardware, software and data—rather than on the
    variety of digital technologies that enable them. And it emphasizes the complexity
    of the ethical challenges posed by data science. Because of such complexity, data
    ethics should be developed from the start as a macroethics, that is, as an overall
    framework that avoids narrow, ad hoc approaches and addresses the ethical impact
    and implications of data science and its applications within a consistent, holistic
    and inclusive framework. Only as a macroethics will data ethics provide solutions
    that can maximize the value of data science for our societies, for all of us and
    for our environments.

  abstract: Global complex supply chains have made it difficult to know the realities
    in factories. This structure obfuscates the networks, channels, and flows of communication
    between employers, workers, nongovernmental organizations and other vested intermediaries,
    creating a lack of transparency. Factories operate far from the brands themselves,
    often in developing countries where labor is cheap and regulations are weak. However,
    the emergence of social media and mobile technology has drawn the world closer
    together. Specifically, crowdsourcing is being used in an innovative way to gather
    feedback from outsourced laborers with access to digital platforms. This article
    examines how crowdsourcing platforms are used for both gathering and sharing information
    to foster accountability. We critically assess how these tools enable dialogue
    between brands and factory workers, making workers part of the greater conversation.
    We argue that although there are challenges in designing and implementing these
    new monitoring systems, these platforms can pave the path for new forms of unionization
    and corporate social responsibility beyond just rebranding.

  abstract: The Digital Government landscape is continuously changing to reflect how
    governments are trying to find innovative digital solutions to social, economic,
    political and other pressures, and how they transform themselves in the process.
    Understanding and predicting such changes is important for policymakers, government
    executives, researchers and all those who prepare, make, implement or evaluate
    Digital Government decisions. This article argues that the concept of Digital
    Government evolves toward more complexity and greater contextualization and specialization,
    similar to evolution-like processes that lead to changes in cultures and societies.
    To this end, the article presents a four-stage Digital Government Evolution Model
    comprising Digitization (Technology in Government), Transformation (Electronic
    Government), Engagement (Electronic Governance) and Contextualization (Policy-Driven
    Electronic Governance) stages; provides some evidence in support of this model
    drawing upon the study of the Digital Government literature published in Government
    Information Quarterly between 1992 and 2014; and presents a Digital Government
    Stage Analysis Framework to explain the evolution. As the article consolidates
    a representative body of the Digital Government literature, it could be also used
    for defining and integrating future research in the area.

  abstract: |-
    Many of us spend much of our time in meetings and at conferences. But too often these feel like a waste of time, or fail to make the most of the knowledge and experience of the people present.

    Meetings have changed - with much more use of online tools, and a growing range of different meeting formats. But our sense is that meetings could be much better
    run and achieve better results.

    This paper tries to help. It:
    ● summarises some of what's known about how meetings work well or badly;
    ● makes recommendations about how to make meetings better; and
    ● showcases some interesting recent innovations.

    It forms part of a larger research programme at Nesta on collective intelligence which is investigating how groups and organisations can make the most of their brains, and of the technologies they use.

    We hope the paper will be helpful to anyone designing or running meetings of any kind, and that readers will contribute good examples, ideas and evidence which can be added into future versions.

  abstract: 'The Age of Sharing Nicholas A. John Sharing is central to how we live
    today: it is what we do online; it is a model of economic behavior; and it is
    also a type of therapeutic talk. Sharing embodies positive values such as empathy,
    communication, fairness, openness and equality. The Age of Sharing shows how and
    when sharing became caring, and explains how its meanings have changed in the
    digital age.But the word ‘sharing’ also camouflages commercial or even exploitative
    relations. Websites say they share data with advertisers, although in reality
    they sell it, while parts of the sharing economy look a great deal like rental
    services. Ultimately, it is argued, practices described as sharing and critiques
    of those practices have common roots. Consequently, the metaphor of sharing now
    constructs significant swathes of our social practices and provides the grounds
    for critiquing them; it is a mode of participation in the capitalist order as
    well as a way of resisting it.Drawing on nineteenth-century literature, Alcoholics
    Anonymous, the American counterculture, reality TV, hackers, Airbnb, Facebook
    and more, The Age of Sharing offers a rich account of a complex contemporary keyword.
    It will appeal to students and scholars of the Internet, digital culture and linguistics.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents a viewpoint on an emerging dichotomy in data science:
    applications in which predictions of data- driven algorithms are used to support
    people in making consequential decisions that can have a profound effect on other
    people’s lives and applications in which data-driven algorithms act autonomously
    in settings of low consequence and large scale. An example of the first type of
    application is prison sentencing and of the second type is selecting news stories
    to appear on a person’s web portal home page. It is argued that the two types
    of applications require data, al- gorithms and models with vastly different properties
    along several dimensions, including privacy, equitability, robust- ness, interpretability,
    causality, and openness. Furthermore, it is argued that the second type of application
    cannot al- ways be used as a surrogate to develop methods for the first type of
    application. To contribute to the development of methods for the first type of
    application, one must really be working on the first type of application.'

  abstract: Many policy-makers are struggling to understand participatory governance
    in the midst of technological changes. Advances in information and communication
    technologies (ICTs) continue to have an impact on the ways that policy-makers
    and citizens engage with each other throughout the policy-making process. A set
    of developments in the areas of opening government data, advanced analytics, visualization,
    simulation, and gaming, and ubiquitous citizen access using mobile and personalized
    applications is shaping the interactions between policy-makers and citizens. Yet
    the impact of these developments on the policy-makers is unclear. The changing
    roles and need for new capabilities required from the government are analyzed
    in this paper using two case studies. Salient new roles for policy-makers are
    outlined focused on orchestrating the policy-making process. Research directions
    are identified including understand the behavior of users, aggregating and analyzing
    content from scattered resources, and the effective use of the new tools. Understanding
    new policy-makers roles will help to bridge the gap between the potential of tools
    and technologies and the organizational realities and political contexts. We argue
    that many examples are available that enable learning from others, in both directions,
    developed countries experiences are useful for developing countries and experiences
    from the latter are valuable for the former countries.

  abstract: |-
    This book critically explores forms and techniques of calculation that emerge with digital computation, and their implications. The contributors demonstrate that digital calculative devices matter beyond their specific functions as they progressively shape, transform and govern all areas of our life. In particular, it addresses such questions as:

    -How does the drive to make sense of, and productively use, large amounts of diverse data, inform the development of new calculative devices, logics and techniques?
    -How do these devices, logics and techniques affect our capacity to decide and to act?
    -How do mundane elements of our physical and virtual existence become data to be analysed and rearranged in complex ensembles of people and things?
    -In what ways are conventional notions of public and private, individual and population, certainty and probability, rule and exception transformed and what are the consequences?
    -How does the search for ‘hidden’ connections and patterns change our understanding of social relations and associative life?
    -Do contemporary modes of calculation produce new thresholds of calculability and computability, allowing for the improbable or the merely possible to be embraced and acted upon?
    -As contemporary approaches to governing uncertain futures seek to anticipate future events, how are calculation and decision engaged anew?

    Drawing together different strands of cutting-edge research that is both theoretically sophisticated and empirically rich, this book makes an important contribution to several areas of scholarship, including the emerging social science field of software studies, and will be a vital resource for students and scholars alike.

  abstract: By using information and communications technologies, public administration
    encourages external actors to get involved in governmental activities once performed
    by civil servants. This article seeks to investigate the open innovation phenomenon
    beyond the entrepreneurial domain in the context of open government. For this
    purpose, a multiple case study was conducted to explore the current state of open
    government in Austria. The study first reveals the role of citizens as an active
    part of the system, then discusses the impact of citizensourcing projects, and
    finally concludes with giving implications for research and practice.

  abstract: 'Digital technologies are the lifeblood of today’s cities. They are applied
    widely in industry and society, from information and communications technology
    (ICT) to the Internet of Things (IoT), in which objects are connected to the Internet.
    As sensors turn any object into part of an intelligent urban network, and as computing
    power facilitates analysis of the data these sensors collect, elected officials
    and city administrators can gain an unparalleled understanding of the infrastructure
    and services of their city. However, to make the most of this intelligence, another
    ingredient is essential: citizen engagement. Thanks to digital technologies, citizens
    can provide a steady flow of feedback and ideas to city officials.'

  abstract: A number of NGOs across the world currently develop digital tools to increase
    citizen interaction with official information. The successful operation of such
    tools depends on the expertise and efficiency of the NGO, and the willingness
    of institutions to disclose suitable information and data. It is this institutional
    interaction with civic technology that this study  examines. The research explores
    empirical interview data gathered from government officials, public servants,
    campaigners and NGO's involved in the development and implementation of civic
    technologies in Chile, Argentina and Mexico. The findings identify the impact
    these technologies have had upon government bureaucracy, and the existing barriers
    to openness created by institutionalised behaviours and norms. Institutionalised
    attitudes to information rights and conventions are shown to inform the approach
    that government bureaucracy takes in the provision of information, and institutionalised
    procedural behaviour is shown to be a factor in frustrating NGOs attempting to
    implement civic technology.

  abstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review of the current state–of–research
    on online participation. The review draws on four databases and is guided by the
    application of six topical search terms. The analysis strives to differentiate
    distinct forms of online participation and to identify salient discourses within
    each research field. We find that research on online participation is highly segregated
    into specific sub–discourses that reflect disciplinary boundaries. Research on
    online political participation and civic engagement is identified as the most
    prominent and extensive research field. Yet research on other forms of participation,
    such as cultural, business, education and health participation, provides distinct
    perspectives and valuable insights. We outline both field–specific and common
    findings and derive propositions for future research.

  abstract: 'The concept of open government, having been promoted widely in the past
    5 years, has promised a broader notion than e-government, as supposed to fundamentally
    transform governments to become more open and participative and collaborative.
    Unfortunately, this has not significantly enhanced a set of fundamental problems
    regarding e-government. One of the problems is that the underlying democratic
    ideology is rarely clearly expressed. In this paper, we have therefore constructed
    a framework for the analysis of open government from a democratic perspective,
    to explore the research foundation of open government and the types of research
    missing. We have looked closely at the notion of democracy in peer-reviewed journals
    on open government from 2009 to 2013, focusing on discussions of some fundamental
    issues regarding democracy and the type of solutions suggested. We have found
    that despite seemingly good intentions and an extensive rhetoric, there is still
    an apparent lack of adequate tools in which public deliberation and representation
    are addressed in any meaningful sense. There are two main important observations
    herein: (i) the rhetoric in the dominant discourse supports the concept of open
    government formulated by the Obama administration as transparency, participation,
    and collaboration, but in practice, the focus is predominantly on transparency
    and information exchange, while ignoring fundamental democratic issues regarding
    participation and collaboration, and (ii) the concept of the public is inadequately
    considered as a homogenous entity rather than a diversified group with different
    interests, preferences, and abilities.'

    and accessible datasets (Open Data) to be used as Open Educational Resources (OER).
    Open Data is an umbrella term describing openly-licensed, interoperable, and reusable
    datasets which have been created and made available to the public by national
    or local governments, academic researchers, or other organisations. These datasets
    can be accessed, used and shared without restrictions other than attribution of
    the intellectual property of their creators1.While there are various de nitions
    of OER, these are generally understood as openly-licensed digital resources that
    can be used in teaching and learning2.

  abstract: The editors of Governance have asked me to assess the extent and nature
    of change in the governing process since the origins of the journal 30 years ago.
    This is an engaging task but a difficult one. It is difficult because trend lines
    rarely have a definitive beginning point—or at least if similar tendencies are
    seen across national boundaries, they rarely begin at the same time. It is also
    difficult because states and nations have different traditions and may be more
    or less willing to accept lessons from elsewhere. As well, national entities and
    even regional ones may react differently to similar problems. Old Europe, as Donald
    Rumsfeld the former U.S. Defense Secretary once disparagingly referred to the
    more democratically stable and prosperous countries of Western Europe, still seems
    more likely to adhere to globalization, freedom of movement across national borders,
    and at least some tolerance of immigration than has been the case in the Eastern
    and Central parts of the continent or, for that matter, in the United States.

  abstract: Crowdsourcing has become a quick and efficient way to solve a wide variety
    of problems - technical solutions, social and economic actions, fundraising and
    troubleshooting of numerous issues that affect both the private and the public
    sectors. US government is now actively using crowdsourcing to solve complex problems
    that previously had to be handled by a limited circle of professionals. This paper
    outlines several examples of how a Department of Defense project headquartered
    at the National Defense University is using crowdsourcing for solutions to disaster
    response problems.

  abstract: This article proposes the techno-cultural workshop as an innovative method
    for opening up the materiality of computational media and data flows and order
    to increase understanding of the socio-cultural and political-economic dimensions
    of datafication. Building upon the critical, creative hacker ethos of technological
    engagement, and the collective practice of the hackathon, the techno-cultural
    workshops is directed at humanities researchers and social and cultural theorists.
    We conceptually frame this method via Simondon as a practice-led opportunity to
    rethink the contested relationship between the human, nature and technology, with
    a view to challenging social and cultural theory that ignores the human reality
    of the technical object. We outline an exemplar techno-cultural workshop which
    explored mobile apps as i) an opportunity to use new digital tools for empirical
    research, and ii) as technical objects and elements for better understanding their
    social and cultural dimensions. We see political efficacy in the techno-cultural
    method not only in augmenting critical and creative agency, but as a practical
    exploration of the concept of data technicity, an inexhaustible relationality
    that exceeds the normative and regulatory utility of the data we generate and
    can be linked anew into collective capacities to act.

  abstract: 'Efforts to engage new actors in political decision-making through innovative
    participatory programs have exploded around the world in the past 25 years. This
    trend, called participatory governance, involves state-sanctioned institutional
    processes that allow citizens to exercise voice and vote in public policy decisions
    that produce real changes in citizens'' lives. Billions of dollars are spent supporting
    these efforts around the world. The concept, which harks back to theorists such
    as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Stuart Mill, has only recently become prominent
    in theories about democracy. After presenting the foundational research on participatory
    governance, the essay notes that newer research on this issues falls into three
    areas: (i) the broader impact of these experiments; (ii) new forms of engagement,
    with a focus on representation, deliberation, and intermediation; and (iii) scaling
    up and diffusion. The essay concludes with a research agenda for future work on
    this topic.'

  abstract: "The growing differentiation of services based on Big Data harbors the
    potential for both greater societal inequality and for greater equality. Anti-discrimination
    law and transparency alone, however, cannot do the job of curbing Big Data’s negative
    externalities while fostering its positive effects.\n\nTo rein in Big Data’s potential,
    we adapt regulatory strategies from behavioral economics, contracts and criminal
    law theory. Four instruments stand out: First, active choice may be mandated between
    data collecting services (paid by data) and data free services (paid by money).
    Our suggestion provides concrete estimates for the price range of a data free
    option, sheds new light on the monetization of data collecting services, and proposes
    an “inverse predatory pricing” instrument to limit excessive pricing of the data
    free option. Second, we propose using the doctrine of unconscionability to prevent
    contracts that unreasonably favor data collecting companies. Third, we suggest
    democratizing data collection by regular user surveys and data compliance officers
    partially elected by users. Finally, we trace back new Big Data personalization
    techniques to the old Hartian precept of treating like cases alike and different
    cases – differently. If it is true that a speeding ticket over $50 is less of
    a disutility for a millionaire than for a welfare recipient, the income and wealth-responsive
    fines powered by Big Data that we suggest offer a glimpse into the future of the
    mitigation of economic and legal inequality by personalized law. Throughout these
    different strategies, we show how salience of data collection can be coupled with
    attempts to prevent discrimination against and exploitation of users. Finally,
    we discuss all four proposals in the context of different test cases: social media,
    student education software and credit and cell phone markets. \n\nMany more examples
    could and should be discussed. In the face of increasing unease about the asymmetry
    of power between Big Data collectors and dispersed users, about differential legal
    treatment, and about the unprecedented dimensions of economic inequality, this
    paper proposes a new regulatory framework and research agenda to put the powerful
    engine of Big Data to the benefit of both the individual and societies adhering
    to basic notions of equality and non-discrimination."

  abstract: "Open data policy mandates that government proactively publish its data
    online for the public to reuse. It is a radically different approach to\ntransparency
    than traditional right-to-know strategies as embodied in Freedom of Information
    Act (FOIA) legislation in that it involves ex ante\nrather than ex post disclosure
    of whole datasets. Although both open data and FOIA deal with information sharing,
    the normative essence of open\ndata is participation rather than litigation. By
    fostering public engagement, open data shifts the relationship between state and
    citizen from a monitorial to a collaborative one, centered around using information
    to solve problems together. This Essay explores the theory and practice of open
    data in comparison to FOIA and highlights its uses as a\ntool for advancing human
    rights, saving lives, and strengthening democracy. Although open data undoubtedly
    builds upon the fifty-year\nlegal tradition of the right to know about the workings
    of one’s government, open data does more than advance government accountability.
    Rather, it is a distinctly twenty-first century governing\npractice borne out
    of the potential of big data to help solve society’s biggest problems. Thus, this
    Essay charts a thoughtful path toward a twenty-first\ncentury transparency regime
    that takes advantage of and blends the strengths of open data’s collaborative
    and innovation-centric approach and\nthe adversarial and monitorial tactics of
    freedom of information regimes. "

    Centre, Canada, this study was initially conceptualised by the author and Zainab
    Bawa of HasGeek Media LLP as a comparative study of organisations working with
    urban data in India. The proposed project originally planned to locate these policy
    documents, especially NDSAP, in the context of their actual implications and uses
    for non­government data practitioners. We wanted to focus on non­government advocacy
    and research organisations working in the area of urban development across five
    cities in India – Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and Pune – and to map their
    practices of collecting, accessing, sharing and using government and self­generated
    urban data, such as those related to property records, geo­spatial data, sanitation
    and public health, elected representatives etc. The two key questions for the
    study were: (1) how RTI and NDSAP have transformed approaches and processes of
    data practices, and (2) can the grounded experience of advocacy and research organisations
    inform shaping of a more effective and open data policy for India?'

  abstract: "Improving public health is a major responsibility of any government,
    and is of major interest to citizens and scientific communities around the world.
    Here, one sees two extremes. On one hand, tremendous progress has been made in
    recent years in the understanding of causes, spread and remedies of common and
    regularly occurring diseases like Dengue, Malaria and Japanese Encephalistis (JE).
    On the other hand, public agencies treat these diseases in an ad hoc manner without
    learning from the experiences of previous years. Specifically, they would get
    alerted once reported cases have already arisen substantially in the known disease
    season, reactively initiate a few actions and then document the disease impact
    (cases, deaths) for that period, only to forget this learning in the next season.
    However, they miss the opportunity to reduce preventable deaths and sickness,
    and their corresponding economic impact, which scientific progress could have
    enabled. The gap is universal but very prominent in developing countries like
    India.\n\n \n\nIn this paper, we show that if public agencies provide historical
    disease impact information openly, it can be analyzed with statistical and machine
    learning techniques, correlated with best emerging practices in disease control,
    and simulated in a setting to optimize social benefits to provide timely guidance
    for new disease seasons and regions. We illustrate using open data for mosquito-borne
    communicable diseases; published results in public health on efficacy of Dengue
    control methods and apply it on a simulated typical city for maximal benefits
    with available resources. The exercise helps us further suggest strategies for
    new regions that may be anywhere in the world, how data could be better recorded
    by city agencies and what prevention methods should medical community focus on
    for wider impact."

  abstract: Policy innovation labs are emerging knowledge actors and technical experts
    in the governing of education. The article offers a historical and conceptual
    account of the organisational form of the policy innovation lab. Policy innovation
    labs are characterised by specific methods and techniques of design, data science,
    and digitisation in public services such as education. The second half of the
    article details how labs promote the use of digital data analysis, evidence-based
    evaluation and ‘design-for-policy’ techniques as methods for the governing of
    education. In particular, they promote the ‘computational thinking’ associated
    with computer programming as a capacity required by a ‘reluctant state’ that is
    increasingly concerned to delegate its responsibilities to digitally enabled citizens
    with the ‘designerly’ capacities and technical expertise to ‘code’ solutions to
    public and social problems. Policy innovation labs are experimental laboratories
    trialling new methods within education for administering and governing the future
    of the state itself.

  abstract: 'Two parallel phenomena are gaining attention in human–computer interaction
    research: gamification and crowdsourcing. Because crowdsourcing''s success depends
    on a mass of motivated crowdsourcees, crowdsourcing platforms have increasingly
    been imbued with motivational design features borrowed from games; a practice
    often called gamification. While the body of literature and knowledge of the phenomenon
    have begun to accumulate, we still lack a comprehensive and systematic understanding
    of conceptual foundations, knowledge of how gamification is used in crowdsourcing,
    and whether it is effective. We first provide a conceptual framework for gamified
    crowdsourcing systems in order to understand and conceptualize the key aspects
    of the phenomenon. The paper''s main contributions are derived through a systematic
    literature review that investigates how gamification has been examined in different
    types of crowdsourcing in a variety of domains. This meticulous mapping, which
    focuses on all aspects in our framework, enables us to infer what kinds of gamification
    efforts are effective in different crowdsourcing approaches as well as to point
    to a number of research gaps and lay out future research directions for gamified
    crowdsourcing systems. Overall, the results indicate that gamification has been
    an effective approach for increasing crowdsourcing participation and the quality
    of the crowdsourced work; however, differences exist between different types of
    crowdsourcing: the research conducted in the context of crowdsourcing of homogenous
    tasks has most commonly used simple gamification implementations, such as points
    and leaderboards, whereas crowdsourcing implementations that seek diverse and
    creative contributions employ gamification with a richer set of mechanics.'

  abstract: 'Transparency has become the watchword of twenty-first century liberal
    democracies. It refers to a project of ‘opening up’ the state by providing online

    of the transparency agenda and the purported relationship between institutional
    openness and public trust. Drawing upon Simmel’s (1906) work, the article argues
    that open government initiatives routinely prize visibility over intelligibility
    and ignore the communicative basis of trust. The result is a non-reciprocal form
    of openness that obscures more than it reveals. In making this point, the article
    suggests that transparency embodies the ethos of a now-discredited mode of ‘instrumental
    politics’, reliant on the idea that the state constitutes a ‘domain of plain public
    facts’ (Ezrahi, 2004: 106). The article examines how alternative mechanisms for
    achieving government openness might better respond to the distinctive needs of
    citizens living in late modern societies.'

  abstract: Digitizing disaster response invites the problems of digital systems into
    the most fragile and vulnerable environments in the world. Troublingly, it is
    often humanitarian organizations that lead the charge, underestimating the practical
    and legal implications of digitizing these systems, from data security to operational
    coordination to the fairness of algorithms. In addition to their own digital transformations,
    many humanitarian organizations actively encourage governments, charitable foundations,
    technology companies, and mobile networks to share data in ways that are illegal
    without user consent or the invocation of governmental emergency powers. The governance
    of emergency powers over digital systems remain poorly de ned and badly regulated,
    and lack the basic due process checks and balances that exist for nearly every
    other kind of government emergency authority. The humanitarian community knows
    that it does not have the technological, legal, or institutional checks necessary
    to fairly or fully realize the promise of digital systems. That knowledge, however,
    hasn’t prevented many of the world’s most important and trusted institutions from
    taking irresponsible, at best, and illegal, at worst, risks with some of the world’s
    most sensitive data.

  abstract: |-
    Reasoning is generally seen as a means to improve knowledge and make better decisions. However, much evidence shows that reasoning often leads to epistemic distortions and poor decisions. This suggests that the function of reasoning should be rethought. Our hypothesis is that the function of reasoning is argumentative. It is to devise and evaluate arguments intended to persuade.
    Reasoning so conceived is adaptive given the exceptional dependence of humans on communication and their vulnerability to misinformation. A wide range of evidence in the psychology of reasoning and decision making can be reinterpreted and better explained in the light of this hypothesis. Poor performance in standard reasoning tasks is explained by the lack of argumentative context. When the same problems are placed in a proper argumentative setting, people turn out to be skilled arguers. Skilled
    arguers, however, are not after the truth but after arguments supporting their views. This explains the notorious confirmation bias. This bias is apparent not only when people are actually arguing, but also when they are reasoning proactively from the perspective of having to defend their opinions. Reasoning so motivated can distort evaluations and attitudes and allow erroneous beliefs to persist. Proactively used reasoning also favors decisions that are easy to justify but not necessarily better. In all these instances traditionally described as failures or flaws, reasoning does exactly what can be expected of an argumentative device: Look for arguments that support a given conclusion, and, ceteris paribus, favor conclusions for which arguments can be found.

  abstract: "​​This book attempts to link some of the recent advances in crowdsourcing
    with advances in innovation and management. It contributes to the literature in
    several ways. First, it provides a global definition, insights and examples of
    this managerial perspective resulting in a theoretical framework. Second, it explores
    the relationship between crowdsourcing and technological innovation, the development
    of social networks and new behaviors of Internet users. Third, it explores different
    crowdsourcing applications in various sectors such as medicine, tourism, information
    and communication technology (ICT), and marketing. Fourth, it observes the ways
    in which crowdsourcing can improve production, finance, management and overall
    managerial performance."

  abstract: This timely collection explores trust research from many angles while
    ably demonstrating the potential of cross-discipline collaboration to deepen our
    understanding of institutional trust. Citing, among other things, current breakdowns
    of trust in prominent institutions, the book presents a multilevel model identifying
    universal aspects of trust as well as domain- and context-specific variations
    deserving further study. Contributors analyze similarities and differences in
    trust across public domains from politics and policing to medicine and science,
    and across languages and nations. Innovative strategies for measuring and assessing
    trust also shed new light on this essentially human behavior.

  abstract: 'Since 2009 there has been a growing interest in defining and operationalising
    innovation for use in the humanitarian context. The increase in scale of new crises,
    the urbanisation of many displaced populations, and stretched financing for humanitarian
    assistance are forcing international aid agencies to think and act in new ways.
    Along with other international humanitarian actors, several United Nations (UN)
    bodies are engaging with new tools and practices to bring innovation to the forefront
    of their work. Within these agencies, there has been a growing movement to establish
    ‘innovation spaces’ or ‘innovation labs’. These labs take different forms – some
    virtual, others physical – and each is created with its own motivations unique
    to the context in which it operates. Despite the variation, there is a growing
    trend in the UN system, and more broadly in the international humanitarian community,
    to create labs as a way to engage in and facilitate innovation practice. This
    research seeks to understand the way in which innovation labs across several UN
    agencies are being used to foster new ways of operating within the UN’s bureaucratic
    structures. We ask four key questions: What form do innovation labs in UN agencies
    take? What motivated their initiation? What are their aims and objectives? What
    impact have they had and how is the impact being measured? As innovation practice
    gains momentum, we reflect on the future of innovation spaces as a way to foster
    innovation within the UN system. We conclude with six key recommendations.'

  abstract: This volume examines the transformation of politics and social movements
    at various levels. Starting with a transformation of identity within social movements,
    it goes on to discuss changes in the scale of social movement mobilisation. The
    impact of social movements on the state is also considered, with a particular
    focus upon the ways in which the state is able to incorporate apparently radical
    political agendas. Finally, the book examines those intellectual and theoretical
    debates stimulated by recent political transformations.

  abstract: Over the last century, state and local governments have been challenged
    to keep proactive, emergency planning efforts ahead of the after-the-disaster,
    response efforts. After moving from decentralized to centralized planning efforts,
    the most recent policy has returned to the philosophy that a decentralized planning
    approach is the most effective way to plan for a disaster. In fact, under the
    Obama administration, a policy of using the “whole community” approach to emergency
    planning has been adopted. This approach, however, creates an obvious problem
    for state and local government practitioners already under pressure for funding,
    time, and the continuous need for higher and broader expertise—the problem of
    how to actually incorporate the whole community into emergency planning efforts.
    This article suggests one such approach, crowdsourcing, as an option for local
    governments. The crowdsourcer-problem-crowd-platform-solution (CPCPS) model is
    suggested as an initial framework for practitioners seeking a practical application
    and basic comprehension. The model, discussion, and additional examples in this
    essay provide a skeletal framework for state and local governments wishing to
    reach the whole community while under the constraints of time, budget, and technical
    expertise.

  abstract: Interest in social innovation continues to rise, from governments setting
    up social innovation ‘labs’ to large corporations developing social innovation
    strategies. Yet theory lags behind practice, and this hampers our ability to understand
    social innovation and make the most of its potential. This collection brings together
    work by leading social innovation researchers globally, exploring the practice
    and process of researching social innovation, its nature and effects. Combining
    theoretical chapters and empirical studies, it shows how social innovation is
    blurring traditional boundaries between the market, the state and civil society,
    thereby developing new forms of services, relationships and collaborations. It
    takes a critical perspective, analyzing potential downsides of social innovation
    that often remain unexplored or are glossed over, yet concludes with a powerful
    vision of the potential for social innovation to transform society. It aims to
    be a valuable resource for students and researchers, as well as policymakers and
    others supporting and leading social innovation

  abstract: By looking at the nature of data that may be disclosed by governments,
    Harlan Yu and David Robinson provide an analytical framework that evinces the
    ambiguities underlying the term “open government data". While agreeing with their
    core analysis, I contend that the authors ignore the enabling conditions under
    which transparency may lead to accountability, notably the publicity and political
    agency conditions. I argue that the authors also overlook the role of participatory
    mechanisms as an essential element in unlocking the potential for open data to
    produce better governmental decisions and policies. Finally, I conduct an empirical
    analysis of the publicity and political agency conditions in countries that have
    launched open data efforts, highlighting the challenges associated with open data
    as a path to accountability.

  abstract: 'The private sector is transforming at record speed for the digital economy.
    As recently as 2008, when America elected President Obama, most large companies
    had separate IT departments, which were seen as just that—departments—separate
    from the heart of the business. Now, as wireless networks connect the planet,
    and entire companies exist in the cloud, digital technology is no longer viewed
    as another arrow in the corporate quiver, but rather the very foundation upon
    which all functions are built. This, then, is the mark of the digital era: in
    order to remain successful, modern enterprises must both leverage digital technology
    and develop a culture that values its significance within the organization.'

  abstract: |-
    As a field of practice and research that is fast-growing and a locus for much attention and activity, open government data (OGD) has attracted stakeholders from a variety of origins. They bring with them a variety of meanings for OGD. The purpose of this paper is to show how the different stakeholders and their different perspectives on OGD can be analyzed in a given context. Taking Chile as an OGD exemplar, stakeholder analysis is used to identify and categorize stakeholder groups in terms of their relative power and interest as either primary (in this case, politicians, public officials, public sector practitioners, international organizations) or secondary (civil society activists, funding donors, ICT providers, academics). Stakeholder groups sometimes associated with OGD but absent from significant involvement in Chile – such as private sector- and citizen-users – are also identified.

    Four different perspectives on open government data – bureaucratic, political, technological, and economic – are identified from a literature review. Template analysis is used to analyze text – OGD-related reports, conference presentations, and interviews in Chile – in terms of those perspectives. This shows bureaucratic and political perspectives to be more dominant than the other two, and also some presence for a politico-economic perspective not identified from the original literature review. The information value chain is used to identify a “missing middle” in current Chilean OGD perspectives: a lack of connection between a reality of data provision and an aspiration of developmental results. This pattern of perspectives can be explained by the capacities and interests of key stakeholders, with those in turn being shaped by Chile's history, politics, and institutions.

    Overall, stakeholder analysis and perspectives analysis are shown from this case to be workable techniques for OGD that add value by exposing the identity, power, motivations, and worldview of key actors. They provide a necessary foundation of knowledge for both researchers and practitioners who need to understand the different meanings of OGD in any particular context.

  abstract: The rising prevalence of algorithmic interfaces, such as curated feeds
    in online news, raises new questions for designers, scholars, and critics of media.
    This work focuses on how transparent design of algorithmic interfaces can promote
    awareness and foster trust. A two-stage process of how transparency affects trust
    was hypothesized drawing on theories of information processing and procedural
    justice. In an online field experiment, three levels of system transparency were
    tested in the high-stakes context of peer assessment. Individuals whose expectations
    were violated (by receiving a lower grade than expected) trusted the system less,
    unless the grading algorithm was made more transparent through explanation. However,
    providing too much information eroded this trust. Attitudes of individuals whose
    expectations were met did not vary with transparency. Results are discussed in
    terms of a dual process model of attitude change and the depth of justification
    of perceived inconsistency. Designing for trust requires balanced interface transparency
    - not too little and not too much.

  abstract: 'Private provision of public goods is typically associated with three
    main problems: (1) high organization costs, (2) the assurance problem, and (3)
    the free-rider problem. We argue that technologies which enable crowdfunding (the
    method of funding projects by raising small amounts of money from a large number
    of people via the internet), have made the overall conditions for private provision
    of public goods more favorable: these technologies lowered the organization costs
    and enabled to employ more efficient mechanisms which reduce the assurance and
    free-rider problems. It follows that if the reason for government provision of
    public goods is higher efficiency as suggested by the standard theory, then with
    the emergence of crowdfunding we should observe a decline of the government role
    in this area.'

  abstract: We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of EMBERS, an automated,
    24x7 continuous system for forecasting civil unrest across 10 countries of Latin
    America using open source indicators such as tweets, news sources, blogs, economic
    indicators, and other data sources. Unlike retrospective studies, EMBERS has been
    making forecasts into the future since Nov 2012 which have been (and continue
    to be) evaluated by an independent T&E team (MITRE). Of note, EMBERS has successfully
    forecast the uptick and downtick of incidents during the June 2013 protests in
    Brazil. We outline the system architecture of EMBERS, individual models that leverage
    specific data sources, and a fusion and suppression engine that supports trading
    off specific evaluation criteria. EMBERS also provides an audit trail interface
    that enables the investigation of why specific predictions were made along with
    the data utilized for forecasting. Through numerous evaluations, we demonstrate
    the superiority of EMBERS over baserate methods and its capability to forecast
    significant societal happenings.

  abstract: Open Data (OD) programs have become popular. OD proponents argue that
    OD  programs are necessary to reinvigorate participatory democracy and active
    citizenship. However, the debate between proponents and critics of these programs
    relies on anecdotal data. The paper describes a methodological innovation (dubbed
    “The Public Sector Information Exchange (PSIE)”) to automatically capture, process,
    store, and analyze metadata information about the Open Data (OD) information assets  published
    by government agencies at any level of government (e.g., federal, national, regional,
    municipal) worldwide. The analysis of the initial PSIE data (currently only about
    some datasets published by U.S. federal agencies) supports the argument that OD
    programs have become the playground of a small number of agencies and that many
    OD information assets are either incomprehensible or impossible to find. The concluding
    section of the paper discusses how to incentivize agencies to improve cooperation
    with OD programs.

  abstract: What is the state of the literature in respect to Crowdsourcing for policy
    making? This work attempts to answer this question by collecting, categorizing,
    and situating the extant research investigating Crowdsourcing for policy, within
    the broader Crowdsourcing literature. To do so, the work first extends the Crowdsourcing
    literature by introducing, defining, explaining, and using seven universal characteristics
    of all general Crowdsourcing techniques, to vividly draw-out the relative trade-offs
    of each mode of Crowdsourcing. From this beginning, the work systematically and
    explicitly weds the three types of Crowdsourcing to the stages of the Policy cycle
    as a method of situating the extant literature spanning both domains. Thereafter,
    we discuss the trends, highlighting the research gaps, and outline the overlaps
    in the research on Crowdsourcing for policy, stemming from our analysis.

  abstract: Why does Procter & Gamble repeatedly call on enthusiastic amateurs to
    solve scientific and technical challenges? How can companies as diverse as iStockphoto
    and Threadless employ just a handful of people, yet generate millions of dollars
    in revenue every year? "Crowdsourcing" is how the power of the many can be leveraged
    to accomplish feats that were once the responsibility of a specialized few. Jeff
    Howe reveals that the crowd is more than wise–it’s talented, creative, and stunningly
    productive. It’s also a perfect meritocracy, where age, gender, race, education,
    and job history no longer matter; the quality of the work is all that counts.
    If you can perform the service, design the product, or solve the problem, you’ve
    got the job.But crowdsourcing has also triggered a dramatic shift in the way work
    is organized, talent is employed, research is conducted, and products are made
    and marketed. As the crowd comes to supplant traditional forms of labor, pain
    and disruption are inevitable, and Howe delves into both the positive and negative
    consequences of this intriguing phenomenon. Through extensive reporting from the
    front lines of this workplace revolution, he employs a brilliant array of stories
    to look at the economic, cultural, business, and political implications of crowdsourcing.

  abstract: What is the state of the research on crowdsourcing for policymaking? This
    article begins to answer this question by collecting, categorizing, and situating
    an extensive body of the extant research investigating policy crowdsourcing, within
    a new framework built on fundamental typologies from each field. We first define
    seven universal characteristics of the three general crowdsourcing techniques
    (virtual labor markets, tournament crowdsourcing, open collaboration), to examine
    the relative trade-offs of each modality. We then compare these three types of
    crowdsourcing to the different stages of the policy cycle, in order to situate
    the literature spanning both domains. We finally discuss research trends in crowdsourcing
    for public policy and highlight the research gaps and overlaps in the literature.

  abstract: Crowdsourcing allows large-scale and flexible invocation of human input
    for data gathering and analysis, which introduces a new paradigm of data mining
    process. Traditional data mining methods often require the experts in analytic
    domains to annotate the data. However, it is expensive and usually takes a long
    time. Crowdsourcing enables the use of heterogeneous background knowledge from
    volunteers and distributes the annotation process to small portions of efforts
    from different contributions. This paper reviews the state-of-the-arts on the
    crowdsourcing for data mining in recent years. We first review the challenges
    and opportunities of data mining tasks using crowdsourcing, and summarize the
    framework of them. Then we highlight several exemplar works in each component
    of the framework, including question designing, data mining and quality control.
    Finally, we conclude the limitation of crowdsourcing for data mining and suggest
    related areas for future research.

  abstract: |-
    In June 2015, the Computer Laboratory at University of Cambridge hosted the inaugural “Data for Policy” conference that was supported by a large network of key U.K. stakeholders including the Centre for Science and Policy (CSaP), Office for National Statistics, Royal Statistical Society, LSE Department of Methodology, Imperial Data Science Institute, and other academic and nonprofit organizations, and government departments. The organizers of the conference were keen to bring together academics, data practitioners, and government policy experts to discuss how to better link up the opportunities for using data to inform public policy with actual examples of successes and lessons from failures. The conference attracted 170 delegates, who made 90 presentations over the three days of the conference. More information can be found on the conference organization's website: dataforpolicy.org.

    From those 90 presentations which covered a gamut of topics, we selected a number of papers which were particularly suited for this special section of Policy & Internet and invited submissions from the authors.

  abstract: Over 2014, the Cornell University Legal Information Institute and the
    Australian National University worked with users of the Cornell LII site in a
    citizen science project to collect over 43,000 crowdsourced assessments of the
    readability of legal and other sentences. Readers (“citizen scientists”) on legislative
    pages of the LII site were asked to rate passages from the United States Code
    and the Code of Federal Regulations and other texts for readability and other
    characteristics. They were also asked to provide information about themselves
    as part of the audience that uses legislation online. The overall aim of the project
    was to develop empirical insights into characteristics of law that may make it
    easy or hard to read for the audience that use it. Also, the project aimed to
    assess machine learning for automatically predicting readability of legal sentences
    at sentence level. A major focus of this paper is to report results and insights
    from demographic data collected during the study. Understanding the audience which
    reads the law is directly relevant to readability - as the relevant question is
    readable by whom? Who are the citizens for whom “citizen access” might be enhanced?
    The paper also describes methods used to rank sentences by readability, using
    the data provided by citizen scientists. Finally, the paper reports initial tests
    on the viability of machine learning as a means of predicting readability in advance.
    The exploratory machine learning results reported here will be extended in further
    work reported in a future paper. The research provides insight into who uses legal
    rules and how they do so. We draw conclusions as to the current readability of
    law, as well as the spread of readability among legal rules. The research creates
    a dataset of legal rules labelled for readability by human judges. As far as we
    are aware, this research project is the largest ever study of readability of regulatory
    language and the first research which has applied crowdsourcing to such an investigation.

  abstract: To understand how significant the open data movement is for FOIA, this
    Essay discusses the impact of open data on the institutions and functions of government
    and the ways open data contrasts markedly with FOIA. Open data emphasizes the
    proactive publication of whole classes of information. Open data includes data
    about the workings of government but also data collected by the government about
    the economy and society posted online in a centralized repository for use by the
    wider public, including academic users seeking information as the basis for original
    research and commercial users looking to create new products and services. For
    example, Pixar used open data from the United States Geological Survey to create
    more realistic detail in scenes from its movie The Good Dinosaur.

  abstract: |
    Online and digital technologies that enable citizens to hold governments to account, known as civic technologies, are proliferating at a steady rate around the world. The potential for these platforms to invigorate citizen engagement, increase transparency, and broaden public debate has been recognized not only by those in civil society, but by governments, by development agencies, and by philanthropists. There is, however, frustratingly little evidence to demonstrate the real-world impact of such platforms. Indeed, there is a paucity of robust research on any aspect of civic technology.

    This report seeks to take a first step towards illuminating the world of civic technology. Whilst answering important, but complex questions concerning the impacts of civic technology is mySociety’s ultimate research goal, this research sought to begin at the beginning, asking the most basic questions about who actually uses civic technology and why. Only by knowing who is using civic technology can we begin to understand what, where and how significant the impact of civic technology can possibly be.

    The report identifies a number of areas for further research based upon the data collected, and concludes with a discussion on the implications of the findings that should provide much food for thought to civic technologists, governments and philanthropic organizations. mySociety’s long-term mission is to understand the impacts of civic technologies. But before they can be fully examined, we need better provision of the baseline facts. This report seeks to begin at the beginning, asking the most basic questions about who actually uses civic technology and why. Gathering data from civic technology groups from around the world, it shows the variations in usage of civic tech across four core countries (US, UK, Kenya and South Africa), and records the attitudes of users towards the platforms they are using.

  abstract: This book brings together an impressive range of academic and intelligence
    professional perspectives to interrogate the social, ethical and security upheavals
    in a world increasingly driven by data. Written in a clear and accessible style,
    it offers fresh insights to the deep reaching implications of Big Data for communication,
    privacy and organisational decision-making. It seeks to demystify developments
    around Big Data before evaluating their current and likely future implications
    for areas as diverse as corporate innovation, law enforcement, data science, journalism,
    and food security. The contributors call for a rethinking of the legal, ethical
    and philosophical frameworks that inform the responsibilities and behaviours of
    state, corporate, institutional and individual actors in a more networked, data-centric
    society. In doing so, the book addresses the real world risks, opportunities and
    potentialities of Big Data.

  abstract: 'This study examines participatory budgeting (PB) as an important kind
    of citizen participation in the Dominican Republic (DR) and the implications of
    this recent practice for agency, democracy, and development. PB is a process that
    intends to drive change with specific outcomes: through deliberative decision-making,
    ordinary citizens select well-being- and agency-enhancing projects that ideally
    lead to more local and authentic development. Together with the attainment of
    these tangible outcomes, valuable subjective states may also come about: people
    feel more in charge of their own lives, community groups become more collaborative
    and cooperative, and more and better democracy is fostered. Taking a step forward
    from previous studies that only focus on PB from an urban planning or public finance
    perspective, the overall objective of this study is to provide a deeper understanding
    and assessment of how PB works in the localities under analysis, its association
    with different measures of agency, the characteristics that drive its success
    or failure, and its general impact on the lives of individuals and communities.
    Drawing on normative and policy-based literatures and specifically following an
    agency-oriented capability approach, this study uses a mixed-methods approach
    to analyze interview, survey, and direct observations of PB public assemblies,
    and archival data with respect to the 2013 budget cycle in four DR municipalities.
    A regression analysis finds that participation in and awareness of PB are both
    significantly correlated with individuals reporting higher levels of individual
    and collective agency when compared to non-participants and unaware individuals.
    These measures of agency are contextualized to the municipal budget-planning cycle.
    A process tracing analysis concludes that PB is likely, under certain conditions,
    to increase democratic participation and deliberation. However, due to certain
    democratic deficits, PB in two DR municipalities does not always increase agency,
    group cooperative functioning, and good development. Thus, PB must be analyzed
    on a case-by-case basis because differences in the characteristics of each PB
    assembly may lead to different outcomes. It is finally argued that rather than
    condemning democracy because of the failures of the current PB system, we should
    advance PB''s democracy further by improving it in various ways.'

  abstract: |-
    Following a promising and already well established trend, in February 2014 the Office of the President of Mexico launched its open data portal (datos.gob.mx). This diagnostic – carried out between July and September of 2015 – is designed to brief international donors and stakeholders such as members of the Open Government Partnership Steering Committee, provides the reader with contextual information to understand the state of supply and demand for open data from the portal, and the specific challenges the Mexican government is facing in its quest to implement the policy.

    The insights offered through data proessing and interviews with key stakeholders indicate the need to promote: i) A sense of ownership of datos.gob.mx by the user community, but particularly by the officials in charge of implementing the policy within each government unit; ii) The development of tools and mechanisms to increase the quality of the data provided through the portal; and iii) Civic hacking of the portal to promote innovation, and a sense of appropriation that would increase the policy's long-term resilience to partisan and leadership change.

  abstract: Cities are beginning a new era of change. From 1920 to 2010 many U.S.
    cities “hollowed out” as suburbs grew faster than their urban cores. The trend
    started reversing in 2011 as Millennials and Baby Boomers looking for social connections
    and convenience settled in urban neighborhoods. Accompanying the resurgence of
    residential cities are complex and persistent urban challenges, including resilience
    against climate change and natural disasters. This report focuses on the technologies
    that shape some key infrastructures and economic activities, as opposed to those
    involved in delivering education, health care, or social services. As described
    in Chapter 2 of the report, technological advances promise to improve the environments
    in which people live and the services that city governments and companies offer.

  abstract: One essential element of open data ecosystems concerns their development
    through feedback loops, discussions and dynamic supplier and user interactions.
    These user-centric features communicate the users’ needs to the open data community
    as well to the public sector bodies responsible for data publication. Addressing
    these needs by the corresponding public sector bodies or even by utilising the
    power of the community as ENGAGE supports will actually accelerate innovation.
    However, these elements appear barely to be part of existing open data practices.
    We conducted a survey which showed that most professional open data users did
    not know at least one open data infrastructure that enabled five specific types
    of discussion and feedback mechanisms. The survey showed that much can still be
    done to improve feedback and discussion on open data infrastructures. In this
    paper we discuss an open data platform which has started to contribute to filling
    this gap and present a usage scenario explaining the sequence of the underlined
    functionality. The discussed ENGAGE open data infrastructure combines functionalities
    to close the feedback loop and to return information to public authorities for
    better open data use and publication as well as establishing communication channels
    between stakeholders. This may effectively lead to the stimulation and facilitation
    of value generation from open data, as such functionality position the user at
    the centre of the open data publication process.

  abstract: This study contributes to the understanding of citizen-government interaction
    in open government arenas by investigating why citizens are willing to participate
    in citizensourcing platforms. We draw on technology acceptance literature, motivation
    theory, and the theory of planned behavior to explain individual citizensourcing
    activity, and quantitatively test our hypotheses surveying users of an online
    reporting platform. Our results indicate that respondents who experience enjoyment
    when engaged in citizensourcing show a higher activity level. Open government
    attractiveness and perceived benefit of using citizensourcing platforms further
    explain high level of platform activity. Besides these factors, respondents who
    previously reported via traditional channels are significantly more active in
    online reporting. Offline reporting experience also positively moderates the relationship
    between perceived ease of use and online reporting. Quantitative analyses show,
    in addition, that individual motivation for engaging in governmental initiatives
    varies across proactive, interactive, and passive types of users. We conclude
    with implications for public managers operating platforms, and discuss future
    research opportunities.

  abstract: 'South Asia is home to nearly a quarter of the world’s population and
    is a region of dynamic economic growth, yet it performs relatively poorly on health
    and nutrition indicators. As a potential route towards addressing this poor performance,
    a range of accountability initiatives has been implemented to improve service
    delivery in the health and nutrition sectors. This is a rich and vibrant field,
    with a great deal to offer in terms of best practice; but there is little work
    that focuses on South Asian innovation and practice generally, and takes a comparative
    and theoretical perspective to ground existing and future accountability initiatives
    in health and nutrition specifically. This report fills this gap. It first summarizes
    current concepts and issues in accountability thinking and practice, focusing
    on practices commonly referred to as a ‘social accountability’. It goes on to
    contrast these with the ‘standard model’ of political and administrative accountability,
    which is prevalent in the literature, and points to ways in which reality often
    deviates from this standard model. Against this general conceptual and theoretical
    backdrop, it examines health systems in South Asia in the light of assumptions
    underpinning the standard model of accountability. '

    co-creation through broad participation. Its novelty, however, prevents making
    sound empirical statements.

  abstract: The Transformation of Human Rights Fact-Finding offers a multidisciplinary
    approach to the study of fact-finding with rigorous and critical analysis of the
    field of practice, while providing a range of accounts of what actually happens.
    It deepens the study and practice of human rights investigations, and fosters
    fact-finding as a discretely studied topic, while mapping crucial transformations
    in the field. The contributions to this book are the result of a major international
    conference organized by New York University Law School's Center for Human Rights
    and Global Justice. Engaging the expertise and experience of the editors and contributing
    authors, it offers a broad approach encompassing contemporary issues and analysis
    across the human rights spectrum in law, international relations, and critical
    theory. This book addresses the major areas of human rights fact-finding such
    as victim and witness issues; fact-finding for advocacy, enforcement, and litigation;
    the role of interdisciplinary expertise and methodologies; crowd sourcing, social
    media, and big data; and international guidelines for fact-finding.

  abstract: What are the sources of legitimacy, and how can legitimacy be strengthened?
    By legitimacy we mean the reservoir of support that that allows governments to
    deliver positive outcomes for people, what we at the CPI call public impact. We
    are interested in exploring how governments can build constructive relationships
    with their citizens for the benefit of each of us and society as a whole. This
    might be at a whole of government level or the level of an individual service
    or policy. We will explore how legitimacy flows between these levels, and how
    legitimacy can be built both from the top down and from the bottom up.

  abstract: As open data becomes more widely provided by government, it is important
    to ask questions about the future possibilities and forms that government open
    data may take. We present four models of open data as they relate to changing
    relations between citizens and government. These models include; a status quo
    ‘data over the wall’ form of government data publishing, a form of ‘code exchange’,
    with government acting as an open data activist, open data as a civic issue tracker,
    and participatory open data. These models represent multiple end points that can
    be currently viewed from the unfolding landscape of government open data. We position
    open data at a crossroads, with significant concerns of the conflicting motivations
    driving open data, the shifting role of government as a service provider, and
    the fragile nature of open data within the government space. We emphasize that
    the future of open data will be driven by the negotiation of the ethical-economic
    tension that exists between provisioning governments, citizens, and private sector
    data users.

  abstract: This article will analyse the implementation of an open parliament policy
    that is taking place at the Chamber of Deputies, in accordance with the guidelines
    of the Open Government Partnership international programme (OGP), regarding the
    action plan of the Opening Parliament Work Group in particular, one of the subgroups
    of OGP. The authors will evaluate two blocks of initiatives for open parliaments
    executed by the Chamber in the last few years, that is, digital participation
    in the legislative process and Transparency 2.0, in order to observe their impasses
    and results obtained until now. In the first part the authors will study the e-Democracy
    portal and in the second part the authors will focus on open data, collaborative
    activities to use those data (hackathons) and the creation of the Hacker Lab,
    a permanent space dedicated to open parliament practices. The analysis considers
    the initiatives that the authors evaluated as part of the transformative and arena
    profiles of the Brazilian Parliament, according to Polsby's classification, with
    exclusive characteristics.

  abstract: This collection challenges the popular but abstract concept of nudging,
    demonstrating the real-world application of behavioral economics in policy-making
    and technology. Groundbreaking and practical, it considers the existing political
    incentives and regulatory institutions that shape the environment in which behavioral
    policy-making occurs, as well as alternatives to government nudges already provided
    by the market. The contributions discuss the use of regulations and technology
    to help consumers overcome their behavioral biases and make better choices, considering
    the ethical questions of government and market nudges and the uncertainty inherent
    in designing effective nudges. Four case studies - on weight loss, energy efficiency,
    consumer finance, and health care - put the discussion of the efficiency of nudges
    into concrete, recognizable terms. A must-read for researchers studying the public
    policy applications of behavioral economics, this book will also appeal to practicing
    lawmakers and regulators.

  abstract: 'The behavioral sciences have flourished by studying how traditional and/or
    rational behavior has been governed throughout most of human history by relatively
    well-informed individual and social learning. In the online age, however, social
    phenomena can occur with unprecedented scale and unpredictability, and individuals
    have access to social connections never before possible. Similarly, behavioral
    scientists now have access to“big data”sets–those from Twitter and Facebook, for
    example–that did not exist a few years ago. Studies of human dynamics based on
    these data sets are novel and exciting but, if not placed in context, can foster
    the misconception that mass-scale online behavior is all we need to understand,
    for example, how humans make decisions. To overcome that misconception, we draw
    on the field of discrete-choice theory to create a multiscale comparative “map”
    that, like a principal-components representation, captures the essence of decision
    making along two axes: (1) an east–west dimension that represents the degree to
    which an agent makes a decision independently versus one that is socially influenced,
    and(2) a north–south dimension that represents the degree to which there is transparency
    in the payoffs and risks associated with the decisions agents make. We divide
    the map into quadrants, each of which features a signature behavioral pattern.
    When taken together, the map and its signatures provide an easily understood empirical
    framework for evaluating how modern collective behavior may be changing in the
    digital age, including whether behavior is becoming more individualistic, as people
    seek outexactly what they want, or more social, as people become more inextricably
    linked, even“herdlike,” in their decision making.We believe the map will lead
    to many new testable hypotheses concerning human behavior as well as to similar
    applications throughout the social sciences.'

  abstract: This communication explores the unique challenge of contemporary urban
    problems and the technologies that vendors have to solve them. An acknowledged
    gap exists between widely referenced technologies that city managers utilize to
    optimize scheduled operations and those that reflect the capability of spontaneity
    in search of nuance–laden solutions to problems related to the reflexivity of
    entire systems. With regulation, the first issue type succumbs to rehearsed preparation
    whereas the second hinges on extemporaneous practice. One is susceptible to ready-made
    technology applications while the other requires systemic deconstruction and solution-seeking
    redesign. Research suggests that smart city vendors are expertly configured to
    address the former, but less adept at and even ill-configured to react to and
    address the latter. Departures from status quo responses to systemic problems
    depend on formalizing metrics that enable city monitoring and data collection
    to assess “smart investments”, regardless of the size of the intervention, and
    to anticipate the need for designs that preserve the individuality of urban settings
    as they undergo the transformation to become “smart”.

  abstract: The growing use of difficult-to-parse algorithmic systems in the production
    of news, from algorithmic curation to automated writing and news bots, problematizes
    the normative turn toward transparency as a key tenet of journalism ethics. Pragmatic
    guidelines that facilitate algorithmic transparency are needed. This research
    presents a focus group study that engaged 50 participants across the news media
    and academia to discuss case studies of algorithms in news production and elucidate
    factors that are amenable to disclosure. Results indicate numerous opportunities
    to disclose information about an algorithmic system across layers such as the
    data, model, inference, and interface. Findings underscore the deeply entwined
    roles of human actors in such systems as well as challenges to adoption of algorithmic
    transparency including the dearth of incentives for organizations and the concern
    for overwhelming end-users with a surfeit of transparency information.

  abstract: Scan any business, technical, or financial media source today and you
    are sure to find an article on blockchains. Blockchains have emerged as one of
    the next big transformational technologies. However, blockchains are more than
    technology and how transactions will be executed and the potential impact on the
    economy is enormous. It’s still early in state government, but with the potential
    in the public sector, NASCIO will be exploring blockchains in the coming months.
    This brief will open the discussion about blockchains and the potential impact
    on state government. We won’t delve into the mechanics of blockchains, nor the
    potential for proliferation of new “e-currencies.” We want to open the door to
    the world of blockchains through a variety of conversations with leaders in state
    government and industry in order to begin discussions regarding where blockchain
    technology can serve the mission of state government.

  abstract: 'The rise of “big data” analytics in the private sector poses new challenges
    for privacy advocates. Unlike previous computational models that exploit personally
    identifiable information (PII) directly, such as behavioral targeting, big data
    has exploded the definition of PII to make many more sources of data personally
    identifiable. By analyzing primarily metadata, such as a set of predictive or
    aggregated findings without displaying or distributing the originating data, big
    data approaches often operate outside of current privacy protections (Rubinstein
    2013; Tene and Polonetsky 2012), effectively marginalizing regulatory schema.
    Big data presents substantial privacy concerns – risks of bias or discrimination
    based on the inappropriate generation of personal data – a risk we call “predictive
    privacy harm.” Predictive analysis and categorization can pose a genuine threat
    to individuals, especially when it is performed without their knowledge or consent.
    While not necessarily a harm that falls within the conventional “invasion of privacy”
    boundaries, such harms still center on an individual’s relationship with data
    about her. Big data approaches need not rely on having a person’s PII directly:
    a combination of techniques from social network analysis, interpreting online
    behaviors and predictive modeling can create a detailed, intimate picture with
    a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, harms can still result when such techniques
    are done poorly, rendering an inaccurate picture that nonetheless is used to impact
    on a person’s life and livelihood. In considering how to respond to evolving big
    data practices, we began by examining the existing rights that individuals have
    to see and review records pertaining to them in areas such as health and credit
    information. But it is clear that these existing systems are inadequate to meet
    current big data challenges. Fair Information Privacy Practices and other notice-and-choice
    regimes fail to protect against predictive privacy risks in part because individuals
    are rarely aware of how their individual data is being used to their detriment,
    what determinations are being made about them, and because at various points in
    big data processes, the relationship between predictive privacy harms and originating
    PII may be complicated by multiple technical processes and the involvement of
    third parties. Thus, past privacy regulations and rights are ill equipped to face
    current and future big data challenges. We propose a new approach to mitigating
    predictive privacy harms – that of a right to procedural data due process. In
    the Anglo-American legal tradition, procedural due process prohibits the government
    from depriving an individual’s rights to life, liberty, or property without affording
    her access to certain basic procedural components of the adjudication process
    – including the rights to review and contest the evidence at issue, the right
    to appeal any adverse decision, the right to know the allegations presented and
    be heard on the issues they raise. Procedural due process also serves as an enforcer
    of separation of powers, prohibiting those who write laws from also adjudicating
    them. While some current privacy regimes offer nominal due process-like mechanisms
    in relation to closely defined types of data, these rarely include all of the
    necessary components to guarantee fair outcomes and arguably do not apply to many
    kinds of big data systems (Terry 2012). A more rigorous framework is needed, particularly
    given the inherent analytical assumptions and methodological biases built into
    many big data systems (boyd and Crawford 2012). Building on previous thinking
    about due process for public administrative computer systems (Steinbock 2005;
    Citron 2010), we argue that individuals who are privately and often secretly “judged”
    by big data should have similar rights to those judged by the courts with respect
    to how their personal data has been used in such adjudications. Using procedural
    due process principles, we analogize a system of regulation that would provide
    such rights against private big data actors.'

  abstract: Open data are held to contribute to a wide variety of social and political
    goals, including strengthening transparency, public participation and democratic
    accountability, promoting economic growth and innovation, and enabling greater
    public sector efficiency and cost savings. However, releasing government data
    that contain personal information may threaten privacy and related rights and
    interests. In this paper we ask how these privacy interests can be respected,
    without unduly hampering benefits from disclosing public sector information. We
    propose a balancing framework to help public authorities address this question
    in different contexts. The framework takes into account different levels of privacy
    risks for different types of data. It also separates decisions about access and
    re-use, and highlights a range of different disclosure routes. A circumstance
    catalogue lists factors that might be considered when assessing whether, under
    which conditions, and how a dataset can be released. While open data remains an
    important route for the publication of government information, we conclude that
    it is not the only route, and there must be clear and robust public interest arguments
    in order to justify the disclosure of personal information as open data.

  abstract: This article examines the emergence of democratic deliberation in a crowdsourced
    law reform process. The empirical context of the study is a crowdsourced legislative
    reform in Finland, initiated by the Finnish government. The findings suggest that
    online exchanges in the crowdsourced process qualify as democratic deliberation
    according to the classical definition. We introduce the term “crowdsourced deliberation”
    to mean an open, asynchronous, depersonalized, and distributed kind of online
    deliberation occurring among self-selected participants in the context of an attempt
    by government or another organization to open up the policymaking or lawmaking
    process. The article helps to characterize the nature of crowdsourced policymaking
    and to understand its possibilities as a practice for implementing open government
    principles. We aim to make a contribution to the literature on crowdsourcing in
    policymaking, participatory and deliberative democracy and, specifically, the
    newly emerging subfield in deliberative democracy that focuses on “deliberative
    systems.”

    some novel instruments to the already rich governance toolbox. But what is its
    value? The current debates on Nudge-theory are often highly normative or ideologically
    driven and pay limited attention to more practical aspects of the theory: Whether
    and how is nudging evaluable as a theory and a practice? Whether there is solid
    evidence available of nudge success over other governance interventions? What
    is to be considered a nudge success at all? What data and evaluative techniques
    may assist in evaluating nudging beyond individual cases? The current article
    seeks to explore these questions.\n\n"

    and migration policies. Non-national disenfranchisement follows from certain migration
    policies, and these may be cast as an arbitrary form of domination, that may undermine
    political legitimacy. Political exclusion is the vertex of a chain of other forms
    of exclusion: the denizenship of the politically powerless is particularly bothersome
    because liberal-democratic systems lack incentives to promote their rights. We
    have singled out the specificity and quaintness of the argumentative strategy
    employed to sustain non-national disenfranchisement. It differs from other argumentations
    in favour of disenfranchisement because it is not framed in derogatory terms and
    shifts the burden of proof from the state over to the individual.'

  abstract: 'This dissertation consists of three essays that advance our understanding
    of collective-intelligence: how it works, how it can be used, and how it can be
    augmented. I combine theoretical and empirical work, spanning qualitative inquiry,
    lab experiments, and design, exploring how novel ways of organizing, enabled by
    advancements in information technology, can help us work better, innovate, and
    solve complex problems. The first essay offers a collective sensemaking model
    to explain structurational processes in online communities. I draw upon Weick''s
    model of sensemaking as committed-interpretation, which I ground in a qualitative
    inquiry into Wikipedia''s policy discussion pages, in attempt to explain how structuration
    emerges as interpretations are negotiated, and then committed through conversation.
    I argue that the wiki environment provides conditions that help commitments form,
    strengthen and diffuse, and that this, in turn, helps explain trends of stabilization
    observed in previous research. In the second essay, we characterize a class of
    semi-structured prediction problems, where patterns are difficult to discern,
    data are difficult to quantify, and changes occur unexpectedly. Making correct
    predictions under these conditions can be extremely difficult, and is often associated
    with high stakes. We argue that in these settings, combining predictions from
    humans and models can outperform predictions made by groups of people, or computers.
    In laboratory experiments, we combined human and machine predictions, and find
    the combined predictions more accurate and more robust than predictions made by
    groups of only people or only machines. The third essay addresses a critical bottleneck
    in open-innovation systems: reviewing and selecting the best submissions, in settings
    where submissions are complex intellectual artifacts whose evaluation require
    expertise. To aid expert reviewers, we offer a computational approach we developed
    and tested using data from the Climate CoLab - a large citizen science platform.
    Our models approximate expert decisions about the submissions with high accuracy,
    and their use can save review labor, and accelerate the review process.'

    Pioneering, diverse companies are using open data to create innovative products and services that fill gaps in markets, generate income and bring wide social, environmental and economic benefits.

    We have identified and analysed 270 companies that use, produce or invest in open data as part of their business, through desk research, surveys and interviews about their experiences. The open data companies we studied have an annual turnover of over £92bn, and over 500k employees between them. This shows the scale of open data’s potential value in business.

  abstract: 'How can we make Europe a leader in the global data economy? How can we
    make sure that the important advances in data analytics - the diseases that will
    be cured, the traffic congestions alleviated, the social problems correctly analyzed
    - are there for citizens to enjoy and companies and institutions to develop? In
    this ground-breaking study, the Lisbon Council explores *A New Framework for Free
    Movement of Data in the Digital Age: Making Europe a Data Economy.* This paper
    analyzes an array of state-of-the-art proposals for facilitating data flows and
    proposes a three-point roadmap for improving the "free movement of data" in Europe:
    adopt "once-only" at the European level: strengthen European-level cyber security
    and crack down on unjustified data localization; and develop more open and transparent
    polcies for data sharing around a new concept of "co-ownership." Paul Hofheinz,
    president of the Lisbon Council and co-author, formally launched the policy brief
    at the Presidency of the Council of the European Union conference on the digital
    single market under the patronage of Jüri Ratas, prime minister of Estonia, and
    presented the main findings to the Competitiveness and Telecommunication Ministers
    Council (Informal) in Tallinn, Estonia at the invitation of the Estonian Presidency.'

  abstract: Social media enable promising new approaches to measuring economic activity
    and analyzing economic behavior at high frequency and in real time using information
    independent from standard survey and administrative sources. This paper uses data
    from Twitter to create indexes of job loss, job search, and job posting. Signals
    are derived by counting job-related phrases in Tweets such as "lost my job." The
    social media indexes are constructed from the principal components of these signals.
    The University of Michigan Social Media Job Loss Index tracks initial claims for
    unemployment insurance at medium and high frequencies and predicts 15 to 20 percent
    of the variance of the prediction error of the consensus forecast for initial
    claims. The social media indexes provide real-time indicators of events such as
    Hurricane Sandy and the 2013 government shutdown. Comparing the job loss index
    with the search and posting indexes indicates that the Beveridge Curve has been
    shifting inward since 2011.

  abstract: 'How does access to information communication technology (ICT) affect
    who gets heard and what gets communicated to politicians? On the one hand, ICT
    can lower communication costs for poorer constituents; on the other, technological
    channels may be used disproportionately more by the already well connected. To
    assess the flattening effects of ICTs, we presented a representative sample of
    constituents in Uganda with an opportunity to send a text message to their representatives
    at one of three randomly assigned prices. Critically, and contrary to concerns
    that technological innovations benefit the privileged, we find evidence that ICT
    can lead to significant flattening: a greater share of marginalized populations
    use this channel compared to existing political communication channels. Price
    plays a more complex role. Subsidizing the full cost of messaging increases uptake
    by over 40%. Surprisingly however, subsidy-induced increases in uptake do not
    yield further flattening since free channels are not used at higher rates by more
    marginalized constituents.'

  abstract: "Migrants leaving their homes for a new country often carry a smartphone
    to communicate with families that may have stayed behind and to help search for
    border crossings, find useful information about their journey or search for details
    about their destination. The digital footprints left by online searches can provide
    insight into the movements of migrants as they transit between countries and settle
    in new locations, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of refugee flows
    between Middle East and Europe.\n\nRefugees from just two Middle Eastern countries
    - Syria and Iraq - made up a combined 38% of the recorded 1.3 million people who
    arrived and applied for asylum in the European Union, Norway, and Switzerland
    in 2015 and a combined 37% of the 1.2 million first-time asylum applications in
    2016. Most Syrian and Iraqi refugees during this period crossed from Turkey to
    Greece by sea, before continuing on to their final destinations in Europe.\n\nSince
    many refugees from Syria and Iraq speak Arabic as their native, if not only, language,
    it is possible to identify key moments in their migration by examining trends
    in the internet searches conducted in Turkey using Arabic, as opposed to the dominant
    Turkic languages in that country. For example, Turkey-based searches for the word
    “Greece” in Arabic closely mirror 2015 and 2016 fluctuations in the number of
    refugees crossing the Aegean Sea to Greece. The searches also provide a window
    into how migrants planned to move across borders - for example, the search term
    “Greece” was often combined with “smuggler.” In addition, an hourly analysis of
    searches in Turkey shows spikes in the search term “Greece” during early morning
    hours, a typical time for migrants making their way across the Mediterranean.

    it addresses key debates on the engagement and participation of organized civil

    of policy discourses along the continuum that characterized three subsequent and
    interrelated emergency situations (democratic, financial and migration crises)
    that have hit Europe since 2005. "

  abstract: 'We are awash in predictions about our data-driven future. Enthusiasts
    believe it will offer new ways to research behavior. Critics worry it will enable
    powerful regimes of institutional control. Both visions, although polar opposites,
    tend to downplay the importance of communication. As a result, the role of communication
    in human-centered data science has rarely been considered. This article fills
    this gap by outlining three perspectives on data that foreground communication.
    First, I briefly review the common social scientific perspective: “communication
    as data.” Next, I elaborate on two less explored perspectives. A “data as communication”
    perspective captures how data imperfectly carry meanings and guide action. “Communication
    around data” describes communication in organizational and institutional data
    cultures. I conclude that communication offers nuanced perspectives to inform
    human-centered data science. Researchers should embrace a robust agenda, particularly
    when researching the relationship between data and power.'

    Faith-based organisations play an important role in mobilising citizens to engage with local government actors on accountability issues. Tearfund supports its partner churches to use a process known as ‘Church and Community Mobilisation’ (CCM). Through this, churches inspire and empower citizens to identify issues in their communities and mobilise their own resources to address them together. Churches then introduce a local-level advocacy component, empowering communities to draw down local government resources to meet their needs, hold local government accountable and see enhanced service delivery.

    This research report explains how Tearfund set out to learn from and enhance its advocacy programme in Uganda. It carried out research in 18 communities in the Teso region of east Uganda, where the CCM advocacy process was being implemented by a partner church.

    To better understand the process of finding effective digital technology tools in transparency and accountability initiatives, researchers interviewed organisations in South Africa and Kenya that had recently chosen tools to use in their work. They were asked why they had chosen a particular tool, how they chose it, and if they were happy with the results.

    Less than a quarter of the organisations were happy with the tools they had chosen. They often found technical issues that made the tool hard to use, after they had decided to adopt it, while half the organisations discovered that their intended users did not use the tools to the extent that they had hoped (a trend that was often linked to specific attributes of the tool). Most organisations did very limited research to understand their intended users, the technology options available and the problem the tool was expected to solve.

  abstract: "What if policymakers allocated government funding based on scientific
    evidence of what works, instead of anecdote, status quo, or political belief?
    In most major policy debates, compelling—but theoretical— arguments can be made
    on both sides. But despite increasing pressure to “use big data” to inform decisions
    especially when resources are scarce, it’s often challenging for policymakers
    to disaggregate the impacts of a specific program from broader economic and societal
    conditions—and to separate good research from bad. By using data they already
    collect and applying the same scientific tool that transformed modern medicine—randomized
    evaluations—to social policy, researchers and policymakers can work together to
    cut through opinion and build an arsenal of rigorous evidence in its place.  \n
    \nDespite the hyperpartisan climate of politics in many areas of the world today,
    the evidence-based policymaking movement is gaining traction. In the United States,
    Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, Democratic Senator Patty Murray and President
    Obama came together last year to enact legislation creating a federal Commission
    on Evidence-Based Policymaking, which aims to develop a strategy for increasing
    the availability and use of data to build evidence about government programs.
    State and local governments—who are collectively responsible for spending $2.5
    trillion each year (about 40 percent of the total government spending)—are also
    joining in. In Washington State, for example, state human services departments
    track and report the percentage of funding allocated for evidence-based and/or
    research-based programs.  \n \nReorienting government decision-making to identify
    and fund programs that work can be slow and challenging, but can make a real difference
    in people’s lives. We offer five concrete steps state and local policymakers can
    take to use data effectively and ensure the greatest return on taxpayer dollars."

  abstract: |-
    A new generation of strategies for government accountability is needed, one that fully considers entrenched, institutional obstacles to change. Vertical integration of coordinated civil society policy monitoring and advocacy is one such strategy. Engaging each stage and level of public sector actions in an integrated way can locate the causes of accountability failures, show their interconnected nature, and leverage the local, national and transnational power shifts necessary to produce sustainable institutional change.

    This case study summary is one of seven that reflect on civil society monitoring and advocacy initiatives in the Philippines – all of which aim to improve government accountability in different sectors – through the lens of vertical integration.

    Textbook Count was a joint programme of the Department of Education and Government Watch (G-Watch), a programme of the Ateneo School of Government that implements accountability initiatives with civil society organisations (CSOs). The programme aimed to ensure that the right quantity of textbooks, with the right quality, reached public school students at the right time, following the right processes.

    This work focuses on the potential consequences of institutional participatory processes in the
    interaction between civil society and the local government. Our aim is to offer a proposal for
    the analysis and the operationalization of such effects in the relation of local authorities with
    the society: do public participatory processes produce any change as they promise from a
    normative point of view? First, we specified and cluster the potential changes (both structural
    and cultural) in the interaction and offer an analytical proposal for the analysis under three
    hypotheses (the hypothesis of the coral reef effect, the civil society empowerment and the
    shift power relations). Second, we show first (and partial) results of an ongoing research
    carried out in three Spanish regions and based on six case-studies where, through the use of
    semi-structured interviews with different actors, we observe actual patterns of change in the
    interaction between civil society and local authorities.

    This report elaborates on the legal opinions and the technologies described in the 2014 report «Big Data – privacy principles under pressure». In this report we will provide greater technical detail in describing artificial intelligence (AI), while also taking a closer look at four relevant AI challenges associated with the data protection principles embodied in the GDPR:
    - Fairness and discrimination
    - Purpose limitation
    - Data minimisation
    - Transparency and the right to information

    This represents a selection of data protection concerns that in our opinion are most relevance for the use of AI today.

    The target group for this report consists of people who work with, or who for other reasons are interested in, artificial intelligence. We hope that engineers, social scientists, lawyers and other specialists will find this report useful.

  abstract: 'Open Data (OD) is one of the most discussed issue ofBig Data which raised
    the joint interest of public institutions,citizens and private companies since
    2009. In addition totransparency in public administrations, another key objectiveof
    these initiatives is to allow the development of innovativeservices for solving
    real world problems, creating value in somepositive and constructive way. However,
    the massive amountof freely available data has not yet brought the expectedeffects:
    as of today, there is no application that has exploitedthe potential provided
    by large and distributed informationsources in a non-trivial way, nor any service
    has substantiallychanged for the better the lives of people. The era of a newgeneration
    applications based on open data is far to come.In this context, we observe that
    OD quality is one of themajor threats to achieving the goals of the OD movement.
    Thestarting point of this study is the quality of the OD released bythe ﬁve Constitutional
    ofﬁces of Italy. W3C standards aboutOD are widely known accepted in Italy by the
    Italian DigitalAgency (AgID). According to the most recent Italian Laws thePublic
    Administration may release OD according to the AgIDstandards. Our exploratory
    study aims to assess the qualityof such releases and the real implementations
    of OD. Theoutcome suggests the need of a drastic improvement in ODquality. Finally
    we highlight some key quality principles forOD, and propose a roadmap for further
    research.'

  abstract: "In February 2016, Wellcome Trust organized a pledge among leading scientific
    organizations and health agencies encouraging researchers to release data relevant
    to the Zika outbreak as rapidly and widely as possible [1]. This initiative echoed
    a September 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) consultation that assessed data
    sharing during the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak and called on researchers
    to make data publicly available during public health emergencies [2]. These statements
    were necessary because the traditional way of communicating research results—publication
    in peer-reviewed journals, often months or years after data collection—is too
    slow during an emergency.\n \n The acute health threat of outbreaks provides a
    strong argument for more complete, quick, and broad sharing of research data during
    emergencies. But the Ebola and Zika outbreaks suggest that data sharing cannot
    be limited to emergencies without compromising emergency preparedness. To prepare
    for future outbreaks, the scientific community should expand data sharing for
    all health research."

    Background: Existing influenza surveillance in the United States is focused on the collection of data from sentinel physicians and hospitals; however, the compilation and distribution of reports are usually delayed by up to 2 weeks. With the popularity of social media growing, the Internet is a source for syndromic surveillance due to the availability of large amounts of data. In this study, tweets, or posts of 140 characters or less, from the website Twitter were collected and analyzed for their potential as surveillance for seasonal influenza.
    Objective: There were three aims: (1) to improve the correlation of tweets to sentinel-provided influenza-like illness (ILI) rates by city through filtering and a machine-learning classifier, (2) to observe correlations of tweets for emergency department ILI rates by city, and (3) to explore correlations for tweets to laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego.
    Methods: Tweets containing the keyword “flu” were collected within a 17-mile radius from 11 US cities selected for population and availability of ILI data. At the end of the collection period, 159,802 tweets were used for correlation analyses with sentinel-provided ILI and emergency department ILI rates as reported by the corresponding city or county health department. Two separate methods were used to observe correlations between tweets and ILI rates: filtering the tweets by type (non-retweets, retweets, tweets with a URL, tweets without a URL), and the use of a machine-learning classifier that determined whether a tweet was “valid”, or from a user who was likely ill with the flu.
    Results: Correlations varied by city but general trends were observed. Non-retweets and tweets without a URL had higher and more significant (P<.05) correlations than retweets and tweets with a URL. Correlations of tweets to emergency department ILI rates were higher than the correlations observed for sentinel-provided ILI for most of the cities. The machine-learning classifier yielded the highest correlations for many of the cities when using the sentinel-provided or emergency department ILI as well as the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego. High correlation values (r=.93) with significance at P<.001 were observed for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for most categories and tweets determined to be valid by the classifier.
    Conclusions: Compared to tweet analyses in the previous influenza season, this study demonstrated increased accuracy in using Twitter as a supplementary surveillance tool for influenza as better filtering and classification methods yielded higher correlations for the 2013-2014 influenza season than those found for tweets in the previous influenza season, where emergency department ILI rates were better correlated to tweets than sentinel-provided ILI rates. Further investigations in the field would require expansion with regard to the location that the tweets are collected from, as well as the availability of more ILI data.

    as it extends into more long-term or ‘chronic’ community development practices.
    We critically examined developer issues and participant (i.e. community organization)
    usage within the context of local communities. We repurposed the predominant crisis
    mapping platform Crowdmap for three cases of community development in Canadian
    anglophone and francophone. Our case studies show mixed results about the actual
    cost of deployment, the results of disintermediation, and local context with the
    mapping application. Lastly, we discuss the relationship of hype, temporality,
    and community development as expressed in our cases.\n\n"

    Over the past few years, we have been witnessing a wave of new technology tools for human rights documentation. Along with the arrival of the new tools, human rights defenders are facing  new tools, new possibilities, new challenges, and new expectations of human rights documentation initiatives.

    Produced with support from the Oak Foundation, this report is designed as a first attempt to detail available technologies that are designed for human rights documentation, understand the various perspectives on the challenges human rights documentation initiatives face when adopting new tools and practices, and analyse what is working and what is not for human rights documentation initiatives seeking to integrate new tools in their work.

  abstract: Since the Cold War, peacekeeping has evolved from first-generation peacekeeping
    that focused on monitoring peace agreements, to third-generation multidimensional
    peacekeeping operations tasked with rebuilding states and their institutions during
    and after conflict. However, peacekeeping today is lagging behind the changes
    marking our time. Big Data, including social media, and the many actors in the
    field may provide peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations with information and
    tools to enable them to respond better, faster and more effectively, saving lives
    and building states. These tools are already well known in the areas of humanitarian
    action, social activism, and development. Also the United Nations, through the
    Global Pulse initiative, has begun to discover the potential of “Big Data for
    Development,” which may in time help prevent violent conflict. However, less has
    been done in the area of peacekeeping. UN member states should push for change
    so that the world organization and other multilateral actors can get their act
    together, mounting a fourth generation of peacekeeping operations that can utilize
    the potentials of Big Data, social media and modern technology—“Peacekeeping 4.0.”
    The chapter details some of the initiatives that can be harnessed and further
    developed, and offers policy recommendations for member states, the UN Security
    Council, and UN peacekeeping at UN headquarters and at field levels.

  abstract: PB employs both direct and deliberative democracy. As the Brexit vote
    has demonstrated, direct democracy doesn't always lead to smarter, broadly supported
    policy decisions. This white paper examines the extent to which PB employs deliberative
    principles and processes, explores the challenges in making PB more deliberative
    and provides recommendations for public officials and practitioners looking to
    improve their PB processes.

  abstract: |-
    Many important decisions historically made by people are now made by computers. Algorithms count votes, approve loan and credit card applications, target citizens or neighborhoods for police scrutiny, select taxpayers for an IRS audit, and grant or deny immigration visas.

    The accountability mechanisms and legal standards that govern such decision processes have not kept pace with technology. The tools currently available to policymakers, legislators, and courts were developed to oversee human decision-makers and often fail when applied to computers instead: for example, how do you judge the intent of a piece of software? Additional approaches are needed to make automated decision systems — with their potentially incorrect, unjustified or unfair results — accountable and governable. This Article reveals a new technological toolkit to verify that automated decisions comply with key standards of legal fairness.

    We challenge the dominant position in the legal literature that transparency will solve these problems. Disclosure of source code is often neither necessary (because of alternative techniques from computer science) nor sufficient (because of the complexity of code) to demonstrate the fairness of a process. Furthermore, transparency may be undesirable, such as when it permits tax cheats or terrorists to game the systems determining audits or security screening.

    The central issue is how to assure the interests of citizens, and society as a whole, in making these processes more accountable. This Article argues that technology is creating new opportunities — more subtle and flexible than total transparency — to design decision-making algorithms so that they better align with legal and policy objectives. Doing so will improve not only the current governance of algorithms, but also — in certain cases — the governance of decision-making in general. The implicit (or explicit) biases of human decision-makers can be difficult to find and root out, but we can peer into the “brain” of an algorithm: computational processes and purpose specifications can be declared prior to use and verified afterwards.

    The technological tools introduced in this Article apply widely. They can be used in designing decision-making processes from both the private and public sectors, and they can be tailored to verify different characteristics as desired by decision-makers, regulators, or the public. By forcing a more careful consideration of the effects of decision rules, they also engender policy discussions and closer looks at legal standards. As such, these tools have far-reaching implications throughout law and society.

  abstract: "Do online and offline voters differ in terms of policy preferences? The
    growth of Internet voting in recent years has opened up new channels of participation.
    Whether or not political outcomes change as a consequence of new modes of voting
    is an open question. Here we analyze all the votes cast both offline (n = 5.7
    million) and online (n = 1.3 million) and compare the actual vote choices in a
    public policy referendum, the world's largest participatory budgeting process,
    in Rio Grande do Sul in June 2014. In addition to examining aggregate outcomes,
    we also conducted two surveys to better understand the demographic profiles of
    who chooses to vote online and offline. We find that policy preferences of online
    and offline voters are no different, even though our data suggest important demographic
    differences between offline and online voters.\n\n"

  abstract: |-
    The recent and rapid rise of digital technologies among citizens and civil society organisations (CSOs) offers extensive possibilities of strengthening citizen voice not just on political issues, but also regarding the overall performance of the government in the Philippines, setting the stage for greater government accountability and transparency. With the advent of various state-of-the-art platforms and channels, the opportunities for political and social participation of citizens have significantly increased. Use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) has changed relationships among citizens, organisations, public institutions, and the government.

    This State of Art Report examines how the Philippines is using technology to complement existing structures of citizen engagement. This includes the government's own initiatives to spur public involvement, as well as its partnerships with civil society and other actors to drive active citizen engagement in the country.

  abstract: The goal of the book is to present the latest research on the new challenges
    of data technologies. It will offer an overview of the social, ethical and legal
    problems posed by group profiling, big data and predictive analysis and of the
    different approaches and methods that can be used to address them. In doing so,
    it will help the reader to gain a better grasp of the ethical and legal conundrums
    posed by group profiling. The volume first maps the current and emerging uses
    of new data technologies and clarifies the promises and dangers of group profiling
    in real life situations. It then balances this with an analysis of how far the
    current legal paradigm grants group rights to privacy and data protection, and
    discusses possible routes to addressing these problems. Finally, an afterword
    gathers the conclusions reached by the different authors and discuss future perspectives
    on regulating new data technologies.

  abstract: An open source project called Apache Atlas was approved as an incubator
    project on 5th May 2015. This project aims to provide an open metadata repository
    and information governance frameworks. The appearance of metadata management in
    open source offers an exciting opportunity to rethink the way we manage data in
    data science projects to create trust to both share and consume data. This paper
    describes the role of Apache Atlas in changing the availability and quality of
    metadata, which will in turn improve both the agility of the data scientist and
    the transparency of the results they produce.

    What are the conditions in democratic governance that make information and communication technology (ICT)-mediated citizen engagement transformative? While substantial scholarship exists on the role of the Internet and digital technologies in triggering moments of political disruption and cascading upheavals, academic interest in the sort of deep change that transforms institutional cultures of democratic governance, occurring in ‘slow time’, has been relatively muted.

    This study attempts to fill this gap. It is inspired by the idea of participation in everyday democracy and seeks to explore how ICT-mediated citizen engagement can promote democratic governance and amplify citizen voice.

  abstract: A number of NGOs across the world currently develop digital tools to increase
    a citizen interaction with official information. The successful operation of such
    tools depends on the expertise and efficiency of the NGO, and the willingness
    of institutions to disclose suitable information and data. It is this institutional
    interaction with civic technology that this study examines. The research explore
    empirical interview data gathered from government officials, public servants,
    campaigners and NGO’s involved in the development and implementation of civic
    technologies in Chile, Argentina and Mexico. The findings identify the impact
    these technologies have had upon government bureaucracy, and the existing barriers
    to openness created by institutionalized behaviors and norms. Institutionalized
    attitudes to information rights and conventions are shown to inform the approach
    that government bureaucracy takes in the provision of information, and institutionalized
    procedural behavior is shown to be a factor in frustrating NGOs attempting to
    implement civic technology.

  abstract: This book explores the power of greater openness, accountability, and
    transparency in digital information and government data for the nations of Southeast
    Asia. The author demonstrates that, although the term “open data” seems to be
    self-explanatory, it involves an evolving ecosystem of complex domains. Through
    empirical case studies, this book explains how governments in the ASEAN may harvest
    the benefits of open data to maximize their productivity, efficiency and innovation.
    The book also investigates how increasing digital divides in the population, boundaries
    to civil society, and shortfalls in civil and political rights threaten to arrest
    open data in early development, which may hamper post-2015 development agendas
    in the region. With robust open data policies and clear roadmaps, member states
    of the ASEAN can harvest the promising opportunities of open data in their particular
    developmental, institutional and legal settings. Governments, policy makers, entrepreneurs

    Yowzit is a South African social enterprise that manages rating and review platforms for citizens to share their views on the quality of services provided by public and private entities. Through an innovation grant from Making All Voices Count, it developed ‘Yowzit for Governance’, a website with information on 41,102 public entities that members of the public could review.

    To understand the factors that drive interaction with such platforms, Yowzit conducted research about the users of this e-governance platform, with the aim of better understanding their experiences of offline engagement with public entities, their expectations of public entities, and their expectations of this platform. The research also aimed to encourage public entities to act on citizen feedback, and to increase the overall usage of these platforms.

  abstract: Due to expected benefits such as citizen participation and innovation,
    the release of Public Sector Information is getting increased attention on various
    levels of government. However, currently, data release by governments is still
    novel, with little experience and knowledge thus far about the benefits and barriers
    of release. This is compounded by a lack of understanding about how internal processes
    influence data release. Our aim in this paper is to get a better understanding
    of these processes and how they influence data release, i.e, to find determinants
    for the release of public sector information. For this purpose, we conducted workshops,
    interviews, questionnaires and desk research. We find that the way data is used
    by a department, the way data is obtained, how data is stored, and the suitability
    of data to become open, as crucial indicators for open data release. We conclude
    with lessons learned based on the research findings. These are that we should
    take a nuanced approach towards data release, avoid releasing data for it’s own
    sake and take small incremental steps to explore data release.

  abstract: |-
    In 2016, OGP’s fifth year, there is an increasing appetite in the open government community to understand whether OGP is contributing to improved government effectiveness and policy making – leading to a real impact in people’s lives. Transforming the culture of governments and making them open, participatory, responsive and accountable is an ambitious project and it must be recognized that OGP commitments are often steps in a bigger reform agenda. That
    said, it should now be possible to start looking at the results emerging from some of the early reforms and assessing whether citizens are starting to benefit from them. With that objective in mind, in early 2016, the OGP Support Unit launched a call for proposals to research the results of OGP commitments, assessing their progress, and how they evolved, and examining the benefits they are bringing to different stakeholder groups. An initial set of completed and potentially transformative reforms from NAPs submitted in 2011 and 2012 was shortlisted for researchers to choose from, but room was also left for examining commitments from subsequent NAPs that have already shown sufficient progress in implementation to enable assessment of outcomes for the intended beneficiaries.

  abstract: |-
    The interest towards the concept of open data has increased during the last ten years, as governments and municipalities have decided to open their data repositories. This has led to a new generation of mobile apps, which utilize this data to improve the feature richness and the overall user experience for the customers. In this study, we interviewed representatives of five software organization and discussed their views towards opening data - private and public - and also using the open data in practice. Based on our observations, the companies
    see very limited scope for the use of open data as a business asset: the main applications seem to gravitate towards function as an additional feature for an existing product, not a source of new innovations or business ventures. The results also illustrate on how little benefit the organizations consider to gain from opening their private data, and what alternatives there are for sharing data in a profitable manner. Additionally, as based on
    the observations, a strategy classification on the different data sharing methods is formulated and presented.

  abstract: 'We compare policy differences across institutions by embedding representations

    all corpora into a continuous vector space. We apply our method, Gov2Vec, to Supreme
    Court opinions, Presidential actions, and official summaries of Congressional
    bills. The model discerns meaningful differences between government branches.
    We also learn representations for more fine-grained word sources: individual Presidents
    and (2-year) Congresses. The similarities between learned representations of Congresses
    over time and sitting Presidents are negatively correlated with the bill veto
    rate, and the temporal ordering of Presidents and Congresses was implicitly learned
    from only text. With the resulting vectors we answer questions such as: how does
    Obama and the 113th House differ in addressing climate change and how does this
    vary from environmental or economic perspectives? Our work illustrates vector-arithmetic-based
    investigations of complex relationships between word sources based on their texts.
    We are extending this to create a more comprehensive legal semantic map.'

  abstract: |-
    Scale shift describes the way that localised collective actions spread to become social forces with national scope, or to resonate in transnational arenas – often through the pathway of mass collective action. Understanding the issue of scale is one important aspect of making transparency and accountability initiatives more strategic. Scale shapes both the causes of accountability failure and the tactics and strategies needed to address it. Scale shift also needs brokers who can create multi-level links across the pre-existing social networks that are widely recognised as key for the capacity to mobilise.

    This research report argues that looking at scale from different angles – drawing insights from different ways of using the term – will assist in taking scale into account when developing strategic approaches to transparency and accountability that tackle symptoms rather than causes.

    The governance field is preoccupied with the question of how we can make democracy work better.

    One of the more promising and talked-about fields in this discussion is ‘civic tech’, the smart use of online platforms and tools that better connect people with their governments. But serious questions remain about how civic tech can make change happen, and what we're learning from the explosion of projects trying to harness its tremendous potential.

    In one of three background papers prepared for the Making All Voices Count ‘Transforming Governance’ learning event, held in Manila, in February 2016, Matt Leighninger considers the extent to which different forms of civic tech enable citizens to engage with governance processes.

  abstract: It is well known that the layout and configuration of urban space plugs
    directly into our sense of community wellbeing. The twentieth-century city planner
    Kevin Lynch showed that a city's dwellers create their own personal 'mental maps'
    of the city based on features such as the routes they use and the areas they visit.
    Maps that are easy to remember and navigate bring comfort and ultimately contribute
    to people's wellbeing. Unfortunately, traditional social science experiments (including
    those used to capture mental maps) take time, are costly, and cannot be conducted
    at city scale. This paper describes how, starting in mid-2012, a team of researchers
    from a variety of disciplines set about tackling these issues. They were able
    to translate a few traditional experiments into 1-minute 'web games with a purpose'.
    This article describes those games, the main insights they offer, their theoretical
    implications for urban planning, and their practical implications for improvements
    in navigation technologies.

  abstract: |-
    South Africa offers wide spread ICT infrastructure in the country and adoption is high amongst the population. With greater ICT availability, there is a growing possibility for citizens to hold government accountable, by sending immediate feedback on service performance through digital technologies. The National Development Plan stresses the need to see citizen engagement as integral, supportive and incentivised with mechanisms to allow South Africans to ensure government actions are held to account.

    ICT-mediated citizen engagement is still a novelty and in its infancy stage, but there are significant structural transformations within policy that are shifting the ways citizen engagement takes place in South Africa. The implementation of various mechanisms, both online and offline, are attempting to meet policy and constitutional priorities embedded within a democracy such as transparency, accountability, rule of law and responsiveness. The current policies, however, fall short in allowing marginalised citizens to use ICTs to strengthen their ability to persuade government to say implement absent service delivery.

    This State of the Art report intends to provide a contemporary picture of citizen engagement in South Africa and the extent to which ICTs are contributing towards citizen participation with government.

  abstract: Earthquake early warning (EEW) can reduce harm to people and infrastructure
    from earthquakes and tsunamis, but it has not been implemented in most high earthquake-risk
    regions because of prohibitive cost. Common consumer devices such as smartphones
    contain low-cost versions of the sensors used in EEW. Although less accurate than
    scientific-grade instruments, these sensors are globally ubiquitous. Through controlled
    tests of consumer devices, simulation of an Mw (moment magnitude) 7 earthquake
    on California’s Hayward fault, and real data from the Mw 9 Tohoku-oki earthquake,
    we demonstrate that EEW could be achieved via crowdsourcing.

  abstract: "This article attempts to question modes of sharing and watching to rethink
    political subjectivity beyond that which is enabled and enforced by the current
    data regime. It identifies and examines a ‘shareveillant’ subjectivity: a form
    configured by the sharing and watching that subjects have to withstand and enact
    in the contemporary data assemblage. Looking at government open and closed data
    as case studies, this article demonstrates how ‘shareveillance’ produces an anti-political
    role for the public. In describing shareveillance as, after Jacques Rancière,
    a distribution of the (digital) sensible, this article posits a politico-ethical
    injunction to cut into the share and flow of data in order to arrange a more enabling
    assemblage of data and its affects. In order to interrupt shareveillance, this
    article borrows a concept from Édouard Glissant and his concern with raced otherness
    to imagine what a ‘right to opacity’ might mean in the digital context. To assert
    this right is not to endorse the individual subject in her sovereignty and solitude,
    but rather to imagine a collective political subjectivity and relationality according
    to the important question of what it means to ‘share well’ beyond the veillant
    expectations of the state.\n \n Two questions dominate current debates at the
    intersection of privacy, governance, security, and transparency: How much, and
    what kind of data should citizens have to share with surveillant states? And:
    How much data from government departments should states share with citizens? Yet,
    these issues are rarely expressed in terms of ‘sharing’ in the way that I will
    be doing in this article. More often, when thought in tandem with the digital,
    ‘sharing’ is used in reference to either free trials of software (‘shareware’);
    the practice of peer-to-peer file sharing; platforms that facilitate the pooling,
    borrowing, swapping, renting, or selling of resources, skills, and assets that
    have come to be known as the ‘sharing economy’; or the business of linking and
    liking on social media, which invites us to share our feelings, preferences, thoughts,
    interests, photographs, articles, and web links. Sharing in the digital context
    has been framed as a form of exchange, then, but also communication and distribution
    (see John, 2013; Wittel, 2011).\n \n In order to understand the politics of open
    and opaque government data practices, which either share with citizens or ask
    citizens to share, I will extend existing commentaries on the distributive qualities
    of sharing by drawing on Jacques Rancière’s notion of the ‘distribution of the
    sensible’ (2004a) – a settlement that determines what is visible, audible, sayable,
    knowable and what share or role we each have within it. In the process, I articulate
    ‘sharing’ with ‘veillance’ (veiller ‘to watch’ is from the Latin vigilare, from
    vigil, ‘watchful’) to turn the focus from prevalent ways of understanding digital
    sharing towards a form of contemporary subjectivity. What I call ‘shareveillance’
    – a state in which we are always already sharing; indeed, in which any relationship
    with data is only made possible through a conditional idea of sharing – produces
    an anti-politicised public caught between different data practices.\n \n I will
    argue that both open and opaque government data initiatives involve, albeit differently
    pitched, forms of sharing and veillance. Government practices that share data
    with citizens involve veillance because they call on citizens to monitor and act
    upon that data – we are envisioned (‘veiled’ and hailed) as auditing and entrepreneurial
    subjects. Citizens have to monitor the state’s data, that is, or they are expected
    to innovate with it and make it profitable. Data sharing therefore apportions
    responsibility without power. It watches citizens watching the state, delimiting
    the ways in which citizens can engage with that data and, therefore, the scope
    of the political per se.\n \n Opaque government data practices (practices that
    we cannot see through, that are not readily knowable), such as those enacted by
    the NSA and GCHQ via the PRISM, TEMPORA, and XKeyscore surveillance programs as
    revealed by Edward Snowden, produce ‘closed’ data. The main point about closed
    data in relation to the state (and it is important to note at the outset that
    the details would be different for commercial enterprises) is that it is withheld
    from general access and circulation for reasons concerned with diplomacy, stability,
    power play, or security.1 Despite the sense of restriction, claim, and withholding
    here, opaque government data practices still involve sharing, however, not least
    because they require citizens to (often unknowingly) ‘share’ data with the veillant
    state in a way that renders them visible and trackable.\n \n But we should not
    think of the positions carved out for citizens in each configuration as an oscillation
    between agency and impotence. Nor is it quite right to think of this as the ‘equiveillance’
    diagnosed by Steve Mann (2013) – an evenly poised balance between surveillant
    and sousveillant forces. Rather, shareveillance constitutes the anti-politicised
    role the datafied neoliberal security state imagines for its public; the latter
    is configured more as either a flat dataset or a series of individual auditor–entrepreneurs
    than as a force with political potential. For those of us unhappy with the political
    realm being delimited and politics disavowed in this way, we will need to experiment
    with ways to interrupt shareveillent subjectivity.\n \n A radical critique of
    ubiquitous and default ‘sharing’ in the digital context is clearly necessary,
    but I also want to seek out opportunities to salvage this concept in order to
    imagine a collective political subjectivity that could emerge from within this
    socio-technical moment (rather than pitching one against it). In this article,
    then, I will propose that we can interrupt shareveillant subjectivity by claiming
    not a right to access more data or a right to privacy, but a ‘right to opacity’
    (Glissant, 1997). In the context of shareveillance, I am imagining this right
    as the demand not to be reduced to, and interact with, data in ways delimited
    by the state; to resist the terms of engagement set by the two faces of shareveillance
    (i.e., sharing data with the state and monitoring that shared data). In order
    to make this argument, I will appropriate the term ‘sharing’ by calling on the
    etymological roots of ‘to share’ – particularly the Old English for ‘portion’
    (scearu) which points towards a cutting, shearing, a part, or division. I will
    posit a right to opacity that cuts into and apart veillant formations and data
    distributions through various tactics such as hacking, data obfuscation, decentralisation,
    encryption, anonymity, and anarchic algorithms. Accepting shareveillance means
    accepting a ‘distribution of the sensible’ that is not based on equality, necessitating
    a different, more ethical distribution, cut, or share by way of a response on
    our part. Exploring a right to opacity in the face of shareveillance can politicise
    the concept of ‘sharing’ by envisioning it as an equitable, ethical cut."

  abstract: Until now, most large-scale studies of humans have either focused on very
    specific domains of inquiry or have relied on between-subjects approaches. While
    these previous studies have been invaluable for revealing important biological
    factors in cardiac health or social factors in retirement choices, no single repository
    contains anything like a complete record of the health, education, genetics, environmental,
    and lifestyle profiles of a large group of individuals at the within-subject level.
    This seems critical today because emerging evidence about the dynamic interplay
    between biology, behavior, and the environment point to a pressing need for just
    the kind of large-scale, long-term synoptic dataset that does not yet exist at
    the within-subject level. At the same time that the need for such a dataset is
    becoming clear, there is also growing evidence that just such a synoptic dataset
    may now be obtainable—at least at moderate scale—using contemporary big data approaches.
    To this end, we introduce the Kavli HUMAN Project (KHP), an effort to aggregate
    data from 2,500 New York City households in all five boroughs (roughly 10,000
    individuals) whose biology and behavior will be measured using an unprecedented
    array of modalities over 20 years. It will also richly measure environmental conditions
    and events that KHP members experience using a geographic information system database
    of unparalleled scale, currently under construction in New York. In this manner,
    KHP will offer both synoptic and granular views of how human health and behavior
    coevolve over the life cycle and why they evolve differently for different people.
    In turn, we argue that this will allow for new discovery-based scientific approaches,
    rooted in big data analytics, to improving the health and quality of human life,
    particularly in urban contexts.

  abstract: There are over 3 billion searches globally on Google every day. This report
    examines whether Google search queries can be used to predict the present and
    the near future unemployment rate in Finland. Predicting the present and the near
    future is of interest, as the official records of the state of the economy are
    published with a delay. To assess the information contained in Google search queries,
    the report compares a simple predictive model of unemployment to a model that
    contains a variable, Google Index, formed from Google data. In addition, cross-correlation
    analysis and Granger-causality tests are performed. Compared to a simple benchmark,
    Google search queries improve the prediction of the present by 10 % measured by
    mean absolute error. Moreover, predictions using search terms perform 39 % better
    over the benchmark for near future unemployment 3 months ahead. Google search
    queries also tend to improve the prediction accuracy around turning points. The
    results suggest that Google searches contain useful information of the present
    and the near future unemployment rate in Finland.

    Open Policy is when governments, institutions, and non-profits enact policies and legislation that makes content, knowledge, or data they produce or fund available under a permissive license to allow reuse, revision, remix, retention, and redistribution. This promotes innovation, access, and equity in areas of education, data, software, heritage, cultural content, science, and academia.

    For several years, Creative Commons has been tracking the spread of open policies around the world. And now, with the new Global Open Policy Report (PDF) by the Open Policy Network, we’re able to provide a systematic overview of open policy development.

    screen-shot-2016-12-02-at-5-57-09-pmThe first-of-its-kind report gives an overview of open policies in 38 countries, across four sectors: education, science, data and heritage. The report includes an Open Policy Index and regional impact and local case studies from Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, Latin America, Europe, and North America. The index measures open policy strength on two scales: policy strength and scope, and level of policy implementation. The index was developed by researchers from CommonSphere, a partner organization of CC Japan.

  abstract: |-
    French cities have launched many urban crowdsourcing tools in the last few years, and are beginning to produce feedback on these experiments. As crowdsourcing is included in local governments' toolboxes, it becomes necessary to better understand how these tools affect urban management and citizen participation. This Policy Brief offers guidelines to support the selection and design of urban crowdsourcing tools that contribute to a more collaborative and sustainable city.

    Numerous urban crowdsourcing experiments show such tools offer concrete promises for urban design and management and for citizen participation, both on a technical level (useful data) and on a policy level (creating a collective momentum).

    We identify three main uses of these tools: getting closer to an “omniscient” city; sharing the urban experience and its evaluation; building the city’s future together. They correspond to three types of contributions expected from the citizen: mapping and reporting, expressing preferences and expectations, proposing ideas and projects to support decision-making.

    Cities should be mindful of the user experience the tools offer. Digital tools embed political “software” that defines their ability to provide a transparent and social experience, as well as the level of freedom and capacity building provided to the citizen. We offer guidelines to take this into account when designing the tools.

    Much of the existing research on citizen participation technologies takes the technology as its starting point, focusing primarily the identification and analysis of technical barriers to adoption and assessing opportunities for technical improvements.

    The authors argue that this techno-centric gaze obscures non-use and the reasons that many citizens remain excluded. Instead, this research adopts a human-centric approach, selecting specific user groups as case studies rather than specific technologies, and identifying the contextual social norms and structural power relations that explain the use and non-use of citizen participation technologies.

    Qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews and focus groups are interpreted through the five ‘A’s of technology access (availability, affordability, awareness, ability and accessibility) and the conceptual lens of the Power Cube, (a means of analysing the different spaces, levels and forms of power that are in play when change processes are attempted). The authors use these methods in order to ask: which forms of power, operating at what levels, and in what sorts of spaces, affect the use and non-use of citizen participation technologies?

  abstract: The aim of this paper is to critically explore whether crowdsourced Big
    Data enables an inclusive humanitarian response at times of crisis. We argue that
    all data, including Big Data, are socially constructed artefacts that reflect
    the contexts and processes of their creation. To support our argument, we qualitatively
    analysed the process of ‘Big Data making’ that occurred by way of crowdsourcing
    through open data platforms, in the context of two specific humanitarian crises,
    namely the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. We show
    that the process of creating Big Data from local and global sources of knowledge
    entails the transformation of information as it moves from one distinct group
    of contributors to the next. The implication of this transformation is that locally
    based, affected people and often the original ‘crowd’ are excluded from the information
    flow, and from the interpretation process of crowdsourced crisis knowledge, as
    used by formal responding organizations, and are marginalized in their ability
    to benefit from Big Data in support of their own means. Our paper contributes
    a critical perspective to the debate on participatory Big Data, by explaining
    the process of in and exclusion during data making, towards more responsive humanitarian
    relief.

  abstract: Advancements in information technology often task users with complex and
    consequential privacy and security decisions. A growing body of research has investigated
    individuals’ choices in the presence of privacy and information security trade-offs,
    the decision making hurdles affecting those choices, and ways to mitigate those
    hurdles. This article provides a multi-disciplinary assessment of the literature
    pertaining to privacy and security decision making. It focuses on research on
    assisting individuals’ privacy and security choices with soft paternalistic interventions
    that nudge users towards more beneficial choices. The article discusses potential
    benefits of those interventions, highlights their shortcomings, and identifies
    key ethical, design, and research challenges.

  abstract: 'Participatory budgeting (PB) has expanded dramatically in the United
    States (US) from a pilot process in Chicago’s 49th ward in 2009 to over 50 processes
    in a dozen cities in 2015. Over this period, scholars, practitioners, and advocates
    have made two distinct but related claims about its impacts: that it can revitalize
    democracy and advance equity. In practice, however, achieving the latter has often
    proven challenging. Based on interviews with PB practitioners from across the
    US, we argue that an equitydriven model of PB is not simply about improving the
    quality of deliberation or reducing barriers to participation. While both of these
    factors are critically important, we identify three additional challenges: 1)
    Unclear Goals: how to clearly define and operationalize equity, 2) Participant
    Motivations: how to overcome the agendas of individual budget delegates, and 3)
    Limiting Structures: how to reconfigure the overarching budgetary and bureaucratic
    constraints that limit PB’s contribution to broader change. We suggest practical
    interventions for each of these challenges, including stronger political leadership,
    extending idea collection beyond the initial brainstorming phase, increasing opportunities
    for interaction between PB participants and their non-participating neighbors,
    expanding the scope of PB processes, and building stronger linkages between PB
    and other forms of political action'

  abstract: |-
    Community civic engagement is a new and emerging trend in urban cities driven by the mission of developing responsible citizenship. The recognition of civic potential in every citizen goes a long way in creating sustainable societies. Technology is playing a vital role in helping this mission and over the last couple of years, there have been a plethora of social media avenues to report civic issues. Sites like Twitter, Facebook, and other online portals help citizens to report issues and register complaints. These complaints are analyzed by the public services to help understand and in-turn address these issues. However, once the complaint is registered, often no formal or informal feedback is given back from these sites to the citizens. This de-motivates citizens and may deter them from registering further complaints. In addition, these sites offer no holistic information about a neighborhood to the citizens. It is useful for people to know whether there are similar complaints posted by other people in the same area, the profile of all complaints and a know-how of how and when these complaints will be addressed.

    In this paper, we create a conversation-based platform CitiCafe for enhancing citizen engagement front-ended by a virtual agent with a Twitter interface. This platform back-end stores and processes information pertaining to civic complaints in a city. A Twitter based conversation service allows citizens to have a direct correspondence with CitiCafe via "tweets" and direct messages. The platform also helps citizens to (a) report problems and (b) gather information related to civic issues in different neighborhoods. This can also help, in the long run, to develop civic conversations among citizens and also between citizens and public services.

  abstract: The Services Trade Restrictiveness Index is an OECD policy tool that helps
    identify regulatory measures that restrict trade. It includes a database of services
    regulations for 22 sectors in 42 countries, covering legal texts in more than
    20 languages. Keeping this database up-to-date on a yearly basis is a priority
    for the OECD. As the information spans over 18,000 regulations, it is difficult
    to monitor changes in the underlying data. The aim of a semantic-based legal research
    assistant is to identify via government web sites, any change in the regulations
    that are used as a source in the STRI database. In this contribution, we will
    present first results using natural language processing and semantic enrichment
    techniques applied to open sources of law in 3 countries (Chile, France and New
    Zealand) for a set of 50 key regulatory measures affecting trade in services.
    We will show that this approach has great potential as it could easily be extended
    to other OECD topics and to other countries for which the adequate data sources
    are available.

  abstract: 'This paper examines the impact of crowdsourcing on a policymaking process
    by using a novel data analytics tool called Civic CrowdAnalytics, applying Natural
    Language Processing (NLP) methods such as concept extraction, word association
    and sentiment analysis. By drawing on data from a crowdsourced urban planning
    process in the City of Palo Alto in California, we examine the influence of civic
    input on the city’s Comprehensive City Plan update. The findings show that the
    impact of citizens’ voices depends on the volume and the tone of their demands.
    A higher demand with a stronger tone results in more policy changes. We also found
    an interesting and unexpected result: the city government in Palo Alto mirrors
    more or less the online crowd’s voice while citizen representatives rather filter
    than mirror the crowd’s will. While NLP methods show promise in making the analysis
    of the crowdsourced input more efficient, there are several issues. The accuracy
    rates should be improved. Furthermore, there is still considerable amount of human
    work in training the algorithm.'

  abstract: The report seeks to bring behavioural research methods for privacy to
    the attention of EU policy-makers. It argues that changes in web interface design
    can be a useful policy alternative to the traditional 'privacy notice' approach.
    Specifically, it examines whether web interface design has effect on people's
    online privacy behaviour through an online experiment (n=3200) in four European
    countries. Results show that the presence of an anthropomorphic character leads
    to greater disclosure of personal information, both directly and passively; the
    presence of a privacy notice leads to greater direct information disclosure. Additional
    psychological constructs (such as subjects' awareness that they were revealing
    personal information) were also recorded, and a demographic analysis according
    to gender, age, education and country of residence carried out.

  abstract: |-
    The information systems of public institutions play a crucial role in how we collectively look at and act in the world. They shape the way decisions are made, progress is evaluated, resources are allocated, issues are  agged, debates are framed and action is taken. As a United Nations (UN) report recently put it, “Data are the lifeblood of decision-making and the raw material for accountability.”

    Every information system renders certain aspects of the world visible and lets others recede into the background. Datasets highlight some things and not others. They make the world comprehensible and navigable in their own way – whether for the purposes of policy evaluation, public service delivery, administration or governance.

    Given the critical role of public information systems, what happens when they leave out parts of the picture that civil society groups consider vital? What can civil society actors do to shape or in uence these systems so they can be used to advance progress around social, democratic and environmental issues?

    This report looks at how citizens and civil society groups can generate data as a means to in uence institutional data collection. In the following pages, we pro le citizen-generated and civil society data projects and how they have been used as advocacy instruments to change institutional data collection – including looking at the strategies, methods, technologies and resources that have been mobilised to this end. We conclude with a series of recommendations for civil society groups, public institutions, policy-makers and funders.

  abstract: This paper proposes a preliminary taxonomy of crowd-civic systems developed
    in a number of areas and geographical contexts. The taxonomy is based on different
    theoretical models of democracy and their underlying visions of citizenship. While
    this classification is neither exhaustive nor categorical, it may contribute to
    discovering connections between theoretical models of democracy and state-of-the-art
    digital platforms and tools. Framing crowd-civic systems within different models
    and visions of democracy and citizenship can also shed new light to concepts such
    as participation or deliberation, as well as to the role of civic technologies
    in reshaping them.

  abstract: Governments buy about $9 trillion worth of goods and services a year,
    and their procurement policies are increasingly subject to international standards
    and institutional regulation including the WTO Plurilateral Agreement on Government
    Procurement, Open Government Partnership commitments and International Financial
    Institution procurement rules. These standards focus on transparency and open
    competition as key tools to improve outcomes. While there is some evidence on
    the impact of competition on prices in government procurement, there is less on
    the impact of specific procurement rules including transparency on competition
    or procurement outcomes. Using a database of World Bank financed contracts, we
    explore the impact of a relatively minor procurement rule governing advertising
    on competition using regression discontinuity design and matching methods. The
    rule does appear to have a small, positive impact on bidding levels, suggesting
    the potential for more significant and strongly enforced transparency initiatives
    to have a sizeable effect on procurement outcomes.

  abstract: |-
    In this paper we study the public debate over net neutrality in the United States from January through
    November 2014. We compiled, mapped, and analyzed over 16,000 stories published on net neutrality,
    augmented by data from Twitter, bit.ly, and Google Trends. Using a mixed-methods approach that
    combines link analysis with qualitative content analysis, we describe the evolution of the debate over time
    and assess the role, reach, and influence of different media sources and advocacy groups in setting the
    agenda, framing the debate, and mobilizing collective action. We conclude that a diverse set of actors
    working in conjunction through the networked public sphere played a central, arguably decisive, role in
    turning around the Federal Communications Commission policy on net neutrality.

  abstract: 'This paper presents a new database of indicators measuring the extent
    to which rulemaking processes are transparent and participatory across 185 countries.
    The data look at how citizen engagement happens in practice, including when and
    how governments open the policy-making process to public input. The data also
    capture the use of ex ante assessments to determine the possible cost of compliance
    with a proposed new regulation, the likely administrative burden of enforcing
    the regulation, and its potential environmental and social impacts. The data show
    that citizens have more opportunities to participate directly in the rulemaking
    process in developed economies than in developing ones. Differences are also apparent
    among regions: rulemaking processes are significantly less transparent and inclusive
    in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia on average
    than in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development high-income countries,
    Europe and Central Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific. In addition, ex ante impact
    assessments are much more common among higher-income economies than among lower-income
    ones. And greater citizen engagement in rulemaking is associated with higher-quality
    regulation, stronger democratic regimes, and less corrupt institutions.'

  abstract: 'To explore the privacy implications of health big data, and to develop
    concrete proposals for how to resolve privacy issues and at the same time reap
    the benefits of big data techniques, CDT has undertaken a series of consultations
    with stakeholders and experts. We examined three scenarios: (1) clinical and administrative
    data generated by health care providers and payers; (2) health data contributed
    by consumers using the Internet and other consumer-facing technologies; and (3)
    health data collected by federal, state, and local governments. In this paper,
    we focus on the second of these scenarios: health data collected by non-HIPAA-covered
    entities through consumer-facing technologies. This includes mobile apps, wearable
    devices, personal health record platforms, social networks, and any other consumer-facing
    entities outside of the HIPAA framework that collect or share health data relating
    to individuals. We refer to these as consumer-facing entities, and we refer to
    their products and services as consumer products. We look both at big data uses
    by those entities, and at their disclosures of data to third parties for research
    and other analytic purposes.'

  abstract: Efficient and thorough data collection and its timely analysis are critical
    for disaster response and recovery in order to save peoples lives during disasters.
    However, access to comprehensive data in disaster areas and their quick analysis
    to transform the data to actionable knowledge are challenging. With the popularity
    and pervasiveness of mobile devices, crowdsourcing data collection and analysis
    has emerged as an effective and scalable solution. This paper addresses the problem
    of crowdsourcing mobile videos for disasters by identifying two unique challenges
    of 1) prioritizing visual-data collection and transmission under bandwidth scarcity
    caused by damaged communication networks and 2) analyzing the acquired data in
    a timely manner. We introduce a new crowdsourcing framework for acquiring and
    analyzing the mobile videos utilizing fine granularity spatial metadata of videos
    for a rapidly changing disaster situation. We also develop an analytical model
    to quantify the visual awareness of a video based on its metadata and propose
    the visual awareness maximization problem for acquiring the most relevant data
    under bandwidth constraints. The collected videos are evenly distributed to off-site
    analysts to collectively minimize crowdsourcing efforts for analysis. Our simulation
    results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework.

  abstract: I conduct an experiment which examines the impact of group norm promotion
    and social sanctioning on racist online harassment. Racist online harassment de-mobilizes
    the minorities it targets, and the open, unopposed expression of racism in a public
    forum can legitimize racist viewpoints and prime ethnocentrism. I employ an intervention
    designed to reduce the use of anti-black racist slurs by white men on Twitter.
    I collect a sample of Twitter users who have harassed other users and use accounts
    I control (“bots”) to sanction the harassers. By varying the identity of the bots
    between in-group (white man) and out-group (black man) and by varying the number
    of Twitter followers each bot has, I find that subjects who were sanctioned by
    a high-follower white male significantly reduced their use of a racist slur. This
    paper extends findings from lab experiments to a naturalistic setting using an
    objective, behavioral outcome measure and a continuous 2-month data collection
    period. This represents an advance in the study of prejudiced behavior.

  abstract: 'Behavioural sciences help refine our understanding of human decision-making.
    Their insights are immensely relevant for policy-making since public intervention
    works much better when it targets real people rather than imaginary beings assumed
    to be perfectly rational. Increasingly, governments around the world are keen
    to rely on those insights for reshaping public interventions in a wide range of
    policy areas such as energy, health, financial services and data protection. When
    policy-making meets behavioural sciences, effective and low-cost regulations can
    emerge in the form of default rules, smart disclosure and simplification requirements.
    While behaviourally-informed intervention has a huge potential for policymaking,
    it also attracts legitimacy and practicability concerns. Nudge and the Law takes
    a European perspective on those issues and explores the legal implications of
    the emergent phenomenon of behavioural regulation by focusing on the challenges
    and opportunities it may offer to EU policy-making and beyond. '

  abstract: "In this piece I argue that so-called “libertarian paternalism” is as
    self-contradictory as it sounds. The theory of libertarian paternalism originally
    advanced by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, and given further defense by Sunstein
    alone, is itself just a sexy ad campaign designed to nudge gullible readers into
    thinking that there is no conflict between libertarianism and welfare utilitarianism.
    But no one should lose sight of the fact that welfare utilitarianism just is welfare
    utilitarianism only if it sacrifices individual liberty whenever it is at odds
    with maximizing societal welfare. And thus no one who believes that people have
    rights to craft their own lives through the exercise of their own choices ought
    to be duped into thinking that just because paternalistic nudges are cleverly
    manipulative and often invisible, rather than overtly coercive, standard welfare
    utilitarianism can lay claim to being libertarian. \n\nAfter outlining four distinct
    strains of libertarian theory and sketching their mutual incompatibility with
    so-called “libertarian paternalism,” I go on to demonstrate at some length how
    the two most prevalent strains — namely, opportunity set libertarianism and motivational
    libertarianism — make paternalistically-motivated nudges abuses of state power.
    As I argue, opportunity set libertarians should recognize nudges for what they
    are — namely, state incursions into the sphere of liberty in which individual
    choice is a matter of moral right, the boundaries of which are rightly defined,
    in part, by permissions to do actions that do not maximize welfare. And motivational
    libertarians should similarly recognize nudges for what they are — namely, illicitly
    motivated forms of legislative intervention that insult autonomy no less than
    do flat bans that leave citizens with no choice but to substitute the state’s
    agenda for their own. As I conclude, whatever its name, a political theory that
    recommends to state officials the use of “nudges” as means of ensuring that citizens’
    advance the state’s understanding of their own best interests is no more compatible
    with libertarianism than is a theory that recommends more coercive means of paternalism."

  abstract: By subsidizing the costs of civic participation, the use of the Internet
    use is believed to stimulate participation but there are fears that intensive
    Internet use causes withdrawal from public life. This paper investigates the connection
    between the way individuals participate online and offline in authoritarian, low-income
    regimes, and the nature of eParticipation among citizens in authoritarian regimes
    such as Uganda. Based on personal interviews with 116 Internet users, the study
    found that common drivers of eParticipation, such as low cost, security and anonymity
    are hard to transplant into the offline world for citizens of authoritarian states
    such as Uganda. Perceived risks of retribution and intimidation for expressing
    a particular opinion or supporting a political cause mean that citizen-to-citizen
    participation is the predominant form but still at low levels, while citizen-to-government
    participation is negligible.

  abstract: This Palgrave Pivot offers comprehensive evidence about what people actually
    think of "nudge" policies designed to steer decision makers' choices in positive
    directions. The data reveal that people in diverse nations generally favor nudges
    by strong majorities, with a preference for educative efforts - such as calorie
    labels - that equip individual to make the best decisions for their own lives.
    On the other hand, there are significant arguments for noneducational nudges -
    such as automatic enrollment in savings plans - as they allow people to devote
    their scarce time and attention to the most pressing concerns. The decision to
    use either educative or noneducative nudges raises fundamental questions about
    human freedom in both theory and practice. Sunstein's findings and analysis offer
    lessons for those involved in law and policy who are choosing which method to
    support as the most effective way to encourage lifestyle changes.

  abstract: This paper sets out the political and organisational context for the adoption
    of behaviour change polices, noting how nudge ideas take their place within the
    standard operating procedures of bureaucracies and in the public arena of debate
    and advocacy. It suggests that accounts of the emergence of psychological governance
    need to take account of the way the diffusion of new ideas takes place in a political
    and public context.

  abstract: 'Over the last decade, there have been significant changes in data sharing
    policies and in the data sharing environment faced by life science researchers.
    Using data from a 2013 survey of over 1600 life science researchers, we analyze
    the effects of sharing policies of funding agencies and journals. We also examine
    the effects of new sharing infrastructure and tools (i.e., third party repositories
    and online supplements). We find that recently enacted data sharing policies and
    new sharing infrastructure and tools have had a sizable effect on encouraging
    data sharing. In particular, third party repositories and online supplements as
    well as data sharing requirements of funding agencies, particularly the NIH and
    the National Human Genome Research Institute, were perceived by scientists to
    have had a large effect on facilitating data sharing. In addition, we found a
    high degree of compliance with these new policies, although noncompliance resulted
    in few formal or informal sanctions. Despite the overall effectiveness of data
    sharing policies, some significant gaps remain: about one third of grant reviewers
    placed no weight on data sharing plans in their reviews, and a similar percentage
    ignored the requirements of material transfer agreements. These patterns suggest
    that although most of these new policies have been effective, there is still room
    for policy improvement.'

  abstract: This extended abstract discusses how public services can become more open
    and engage citizens more actively, by providing the local, public administration
    with the right tools. It calls for public services to think more creatively about
    how they can collaborate with the public to make better use of the energy and
    enthusiasm, as well as missing skills that people have and want to offer. It explores
    the challenges, both in terms of policy and technology, that public services face
    in mobilizing resources that are, by nature, voluntary. We intend to provide the
    governance tools that enable public services to leverage skills coming from the
    local community, and improve their autonomy, transparency and analytical tools
    required for true open governance.

  abstract: Public participation has been less than ideal in many government-implemented
    ICT initiatives. Extant studies highlight the importance of public libraries as
    an intermediary between citizens and government. This study evaluates the role
    of public libraries as mediating the relationship between citizens and government
    in support of an open government environment. Using data from a national survey
    of "Library and Technology Use" conducted by PEW Internet in 2015, we test whether
    a citizen's perception of public values provided by public libraries influence
    the likelihood of the citizen's engagement within open-government environment
    contexts. The results signify a significant relationship between certain public
    values provided by public libraries with the propensity of citizens engaging government
    in an online environment. Our findings further indicate that varying public values
    generate different results in regard to the way citizens are stimulated to use
    public libraries to engage with government online. These findings imply that programs
    designed and developed to take into account a variety of values are more likely
    to effectively induce citizen engagement in an open government environment through
    the mediation of public libraries.

  abstract: This article makes three related arguments. First, that although many
    definitions of the smart city have been proposed, corporate promoters say a smart
    city uses information technology to pursue efficient systems through real-time
    monitoring and control. Second, this definition is not new and equivalent to the
    idea of urban cybernetics debated in the 1970s. Third, drawing on a discussion
    of Rio de Janeiro’s Operations Center, I argue that viewing urban problems as
    wicked problems allows for more fundamental solutions than urban cybernetics,
    but requires local innovation and stakeholder participation. Therefore the last
    section describes institutions for municipal innovation and IT-enabled collaborative
    planning.

  abstract: Policy analytics combines new data sources, such as from mobile smartphones,
    Internet of Everything devices, and electronic payment cards, with new data analytics
    techniques for informing and directing public policy. However, those who do not
    own these devices may be rendered digitally invisible if data from their daily
    actions are not captured. We explore the digitally invisible through an exploratory
    study of homeless individuals in Phoenix, Arizona, in the context of extreme heat
    exposure. Ten homeless research participants carried a temperature-sensing device
    during an extreme heat week, with their individually experienced temperatures
    (IETs) compared to outdoor ambient temperatures. A nonhomeless, digitally connected
    sample of 10 university students was also observed, with their IETs analyzed in
    the same way. Surveys of participants complement the temperature measures. We
    found that homeless individuals and university students interact differently with
    the physical environment, experiencing substantial differences in individual temperatures
    relative to outdoor conditions, potentially leading to differentiated health risks
    and outcomes. They also interact differently with technology, with the homeless
    having fewer opportunities to benefit from digital services and lower likelihood
    to generate digital data that might influence policy analytics. Failing to account
    for these differences may result in biased policy analytics and misdirected policy
    interventions.

  abstract: Open government and open data are new areas of research, advocacy and
    activism that have entered the governance field alongside the more established
    areas of transparency and accountability. This article reviews recent scholarship
    in these areas, pinpointing contributions to more open, transparent, accountable
    and responsive governance via improved practice, projects and programmes. The
    authors set the rest of the articles from this IDS Bulletin in the context of
    the ideas, relationships, processes, behaviours, policy frameworks and aid funding
    practices of the last five years, and critically discuss questions and weaknesses
    that limit the effectiveness and impact of this work. Identifying conceptual ambiguity
    as a key problem, they offer a series of definitions to help overcome the technical
    and political difficulties this causes. They also identify hype and euphemism,
    and offer a series of conclusions to help restore meaning and ideological content
    to work on open government and open data in transparent and accountable governance.

  abstract: 'The book comprehensively debunks the myth of a lumbering, bureaucratic
    state versus a dynamic, innovative private sector. In a series of case studies—from
    IT, biotech, nanotech to today’s emerging green tech—Professor Mazzucato shows
    that the opposite is true: the private sector only finds the courage to invest
    after an entrepreneurial state has made the high-risk investments. In an intensely
    researched chapter, she reveals that every technology that makes the iPhone so
    ‘smart’ was government funded: the Internet, GPS, its touch-screen display and
    the voice-activated Siri. Mazzucato also controversially argues that in the history
    of modern capitalism the State has not only fixed market failures, but has also
    actively shaped and created markets. In doing so, it sometimes wins and sometimes
    fails. Yet by not admitting the State’s role in such active risk taking, and pretending
    that the state only cheers on the side-lines while the private sector roars, we
    have ended up creating an ‘innovation system’ whereby the public sector socializes
    risks, while rewards are privatized. The book considers how to change this dysfunctional
    dynamic so that economic growth can be not only ‘smart’ but also ‘inclusive’.'

  abstract: Governments are increasingly adopting online platforms to engage the public
    and allow a broad and diverse group of citizens to participate in the planning
    of government policies. To understand the role of crowds in the online public
    policy process, we analyse participant contributions over time in two crowd-based
    policy processes, the Future Melbourne wiki and the Open Government Dialogue.
    Although past evaluations have shown the significance of public consultations
    by expanding the engaged population within a short period of time, our empirical
    case studies suggest that a small number of participants contribute a disproportionate
    share of ideas and opinions. We discuss the implications of our initial examination
    for the future design of engagement platforms.

  abstract: The objective of this article is to highlight the contribution and importance
    of parliamentary information visualization (PIV) with a view to legislative transparency
    and citizen empowerment. The constant appeal for parliamentary openness regarding
    information on laws and bills and accountability of elected representatives calls
    for transparency in parliamentary procedures and at several areas of parliamentary
    informatics, in order to enhance democratic control and re-establish constituents’
    trust. On the other hand, the provision of easy to understand and analyze information
    plays a central role to the achievement of transparency. In this respect, this
    paper provides an overview of the characteristics and capabilities of information
    visualization that can contribute to delineating the institutional, but also technical
    possibilities and constraints of achieving legislative transparency. On the basis
    of this overview, it is attempted to highlight some causal relationships between
    parliamentary openness, legislative transparency and parliamentary information
    visualization, and discuss the potential and limitations of PIV not only in terms
    of technical solutions but also with respect to human factors and political aspects
    that need to be considered as further determining the success or failure of PIV
    efforts. In this line of thought, the concluding section of the article provides
    a discussion on the strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats that can be
    identified for parliamentary information visualization, as well as on dimensions
    and specific checkpoints that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of PIV
    efforts, as regards the end objective of citizen empowerment.

  abstract: 'Open government initiatives, which include not only transparency but
    also participation and collaboration policies, have become a major administrative
    reform. As such, these initiatives are gaining cohesiveness in literature. President
    Obama supported open government through a range of policies including the Open
    Government Partnership (OGP), a multinational initiative. The OGP requires member
    organizations to develop open government national action plans, which are used
    as the basis for my analysis. To frame this paper, I use and expand upon David
    Heald’s directions and varieties of transparency framework. A content analysis
    of the 62 commitments in the US Second Open Government National Action Plan was
    conducted. The analysis provides two findings of note: First, the traditional
    view of transparency was indeed the most prevalent in the policies proposed. In
    that respect, not much has changed, even with the OGP’s emphasis on a range moof
    approaches. Second, openness among and between agencies played a larger than expected
    role. While the OGP pushed an array of administrative reforms, the initiative
    had limited impact on the type of policies that were proposed and enacted. In
    sum, the OGP is an administrative reform that was launched with great fanfare,
    but limited influence in the US context. More research needs to be conducted to
    determine is the “open government reform” movement as a whole suffers from such
    problems in implementation.'

  abstract: One of the challenges envisioned for eGovernment is how to actively involve
    citizens in the improvement of public services, allowing governments to offer
    better services. However, citizen involvement in public service design through
    ICT is not an easy goal. Services have been deployed internally in public organizations,
    making it difficult to be leveraged by citizens, specifically those without an
    IT background. This research moves towards decreasing the gap between public services
    process opacity and complexity and citizens' lack of interest or com-petencies
    to understand them. The paper discusses game design as an approach to motivate,
    engage and change citizens' behavior with respect to public services improvement.
    The design of a sample serious game is proposed; benefits and challenges are discussed
    using a public service delivery scenario from Brazil.

  abstract: The release of the Google Maps API in 2005 spurred a trend of mapping
    mashups, adding cartography to online participatory culture. This article will
    present how the affordances of these “platforms” give shape to the online participation
    of concerned citizens willing to access information during an environmental crisis.
    Based on the analysis of the radiation mashups created after the disaster at the
    Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011, this article will highlight two types of
    online participation. First, participation as data extraction, where concerned
    actors either monitored data using Geiger counters or extracted and republished
    data from official websites. Second, participation as data aggregation, where
    maps were used to display and compare radiation measurements from official or
    crowdsourced venues. The conclusion will highlight the necessity to study how
    online platforms assign a place and temporality to online participation.

  abstract: In 2011, Indonesia started its Open Government journey when along with
    seven other countries it initiated Open Government Partnership. Following the
    global declaration, Indonesia launched the Open Government Indonesia (OGI) in
    January 2012 with the aim to introduce open government reforms, including open
    data. This initiative is supported by Law No. 14/2008 on Freedom of Information.
    Despite its early stage, the implementation of Open Government in Indonesia has
    shown promising developments, with three action plans enacted in the last four
    years. In the Southeast Asian region, Indonesia could be considered a pioneer
    in implementing the open data initiative at national as well as sub-national levels.
    In some cases, the open data initiative at sub-national level has even surpassed
    the progress at the national level. Jakarta, for example, became the first city
    to have its own gubernatorial bylaw on data and system management, which requires
    the city administration and agencies to open its public data, thus leading to
    the birth of open data initiatives in the city. The city also have Jakarta Smart
    City that connect sub-districts officials with the citizen. Jakarta Smart City
    is an initiative that promote openness of the government through public service
    delivery. This paper aims to take a closer look on the dynamics of citizens-generated
    data in Jakarta and how Jakarta smart city program contributes to the implementation
    of open data.

  abstract: 'In Israel and Palestine, map-making practices were always entangled with
    contradictive spatial identities and imbalanced power resources. Although an Israeli
    narrative has largely dominated the ‘cartographic battlefield’, the latest chapter
    of this story has not been written yet: collaborative forms of web 2.0 cartographies
    have restructured power relations in mapping practices and challenged traditional
    monopolies on map and spatial data production. Thus, we can expect web 2.0 cartographies
    to be a ‘game changer’ for cartography in Palestine and Israel. In this paper,
    I review this assumption with the popular example of OpenStreetMap (OSM). Following
    a mixed methods approach, I comparatively analyze the genesis of OSM in Israel
    and Palestine. Although nationalist motives do not play a significant role on
    either side, it turns out that the project is dominated by Israeli and international
    mappers, whereas Palestinians have hardly contributed to OSM. As a result, social
    fragmentations and imbalances between Israel and Palestine are largely reproduced
    through OSM data. Discussing the low involvement of Palestinians, I argue that
    OSM''s ground truth paradigm might be a watershed for participation. Presumably,
    the project''s data are less meaningful in some local contexts than in others.
    Moreover, the seemingly apolitical approach to map only ‘facts on the ground’
    reaffirms present spatio-social order and thus the power relations behind it.
    Within a Palestinian narrative, however, many aspects of the factual material
    space might appear not as neutral physical objects but as results of suppression,
    in which case, any ‘accurate’ spatial representation, such as OSM, becomes objectionable.'

  abstract: Making All Voices Count is a program that began with a clearly defined
    set of aims, a theory of change (ToC) and a structure centered on four linked
    components - innovation, scaling, research and evidence, and catalyzing global
    action. In its first year, activities were carried out under each component. Ongoing
    reflections on the challenges, successes and failures of each of these activities
    were combined with a deeper analysis of the assumptions behind the program’s ToC.
    These reflections led to the development of a revised framework and the elaboration
    of a strategic approach that will shape Making All Voices Count as it moves forward.
    This synthesis document, written in October 2014, first describes the program’s
    evolving approach and ways of working, before presenting this strategic approach
    to its future activities.

  abstract: 'Does the digitization of land titles need to be framed within larger
    issues of Governance and move beyond narrow techno-administrative narratives?
    In doing so, what are the ranges of political economies that such interventions
    encounter and how do these relate to various forms of contests. What are readings
    of land titles digitization and its re-production in a variety of contexts of
    the ‘South’ and especially under conditions of globalization to contest with assumptions
    promoted by writers like Hernando De-Soto? This paper looks at the ‘Bhoomi program’
    and its consequence of digitizing land records in districts surrounding Bangalore.
    The Bhoomi program on the digitization of twenty million land records is considered
    a ‘best practice’ model of ‘e-governance’ to be replicated in other parts of India
    and elsewhere in poor countries. The main findings, at two levels, contrast conventional
    wisdom. First the digitization of land records led to increased corruption, much
    more bribes and substantially increased time taken for land transactions. At another
    level, it facilitated very large players in the land markets to capture vast quantities
    of land at a time when Bangalore experiences a boom in the land market. These
    consequences have come about via the centralization of both land records and management
    away from the village panchayat to the district level. The study comes out of
    detailed ethnographic research methods to detail out the process.

  abstract: 'Crowdsourcing is an emerging technology where innovation and production
    are sourced out to the public through an open call. At the center of crowdsourcing
    is a resource allocation problem: there is an abundance of workers but a scarcity
    of high skills, and an easy task assigned to a high-skill worker is a waste of
    resources. This problem is complicated by the fact that the exact difficulties
    of innovation tasks may not be known in advance, so tasks that require high-skill
    labor cannot be identified and allocated ahead of time. We show that the solution
    to this problem takes the form of a skill hierarchy, where tasks are first attempted
    by low-skill labor, and high skill workers only engage with a task if less skilled
    workers are unable to finish it. This hierarchy can be constructed and implemented
    in a decentralized manner even though neither the difficulties of the tasks nor
    the skills of the candidate workers are known. We provide a dynamic pricing mechanism
    that achieves this implementation by inducing workers to self-select into different
    layers. The mechanism is simple: each time a task is attempted and not finished,
    its price (reward upon completion) goes up.'

    Colombian e-government development has been internationally recognised by the UN as a leader in Latin America, and one of the 20 most developed nations of the world in the area. However, ICT tools and services such as broadband are a luxury. Colombia suffers from an access divide due to economic and infrastructural limitations, and a second level digital divide because of weak information and data literacy.

    This Brief focuses on identifying the impact of ICT mediation in democratisation and citizen engagement in terms of what is understood as governance, how those representations are legitimised, and the ways in which they change power relations. The authors reviewed Colombian ICT mediation policies, placed them in relation to the context, and contrasted them with previous research about local e-democracy developments. This gave a characterisation of how Colombian e-government routines have evolved.

    Across the world, increased internet adoption has radically altered people's lives - creating the need for new methods of internet governance that are more effective, flexible, inclusive, and legitimate.

    This paper seeks to address that need, by proposing a distributed yet coordinated framework for internet governance - one which accommodates existing and emerging decision-making approaches, while also enabling broader participation by a wider range of institutions and actors.

    This report tells the stories of cities around the world - from Beijing to Amsterdam, and from London to Jakarta - that are addressing urban challenges by using digital technologies to engage and enable citizens.

    Key findings

    Many ‘top down’ smart city ideas have failed to deliver on their promise, combining high costs and low returns.
    ‘Collaborative technologies’ offer cities another way to make smarter use of resources, smarter ways of collecting data and smarter ways to make decisions.
    Collaborative technologies can also help citizens themselves shape the future of their cities.
    We have created five recommendations for city government who want to make their cities smarter.
    As cities bring people together to live, work and play, they amplify their ability to create wealth and ideas. But scale and density also bring acute challenges: how to move around people and things; how to provide energy; how to keep people safe.

    ‘Smart cities’ offer sensors, ‘big data’ and advanced computing as answers to these challenges, but they have often faced criticism for being too concerned with hardware rather than with people.

    In this report we argue that successful smart cities of the future will combine the best aspects of technology infrastructure while making the most of the growing potential of 'collaborative technologies', technologies that enable greater collaboration between urban communities and between citizens and city governments.

    How will this work in practice? Drawing on examples from all around the world we investigate four emerging methods which are helping city governments engage and enable citizens: the collaborative economy, crowdsourcing data, collective intelligence and crowdfunding.

    Policy recommendations

    Set up a civic innovation lab to drive innovation in collaborative technologies.
    Use open data and open platforms to mobilise collective knowledge.
    Take human behaviour as seriously as technology.
    Invest in smart people, not just smart technology.
    Spread the potential of collaborative technologies to all parts of society.

  abstract: 'This is the first book-length treatment of the concepts, designs, methods,
    and tools needed to conduct effective advocacy and policy change evaluations.
    By integrating insights from different disciplines, Part I provides a conceptual
    foundation for navigating advocacy tactics within today''s turbulent policy landscape.
    Part II offers recommendations for developing appropriate evaluation designs and
    working with unique advocacy and policy change-oriented instruments. Part III
    turns toward opportunities and challenges in this growing field. In addition to
    describing actual designs and measures, the chapters include suggestions for addressing
    specific challenges of working in a policy setting, such as a long time horizon
    for achieving meaningful change. To illuminate and advance this area of evaluation
    practice, the authors draw on over 30 years of evaluation experience; collective
    wisdom based on a new, large-scale survey of evaluators in the field; and in-depth
    case studies on diverse issues - from the environment, to public health, to human
    rights. Ideal for evaluators, change makers, and funders, this book is the definitive
    guide to advocacy and policy change evaluation. '

  abstract: 'Can Crowds serve as useful allies in policy design? How do non-expert
    Crowds perform relative to experts in the assessment of policy measures? Does
    the geographic location of non-expert Crowds, with relevance to the policy context,
    alter the performance of non-experts Crowds in the assessment of policy measures?
    In this work, we investigate these questions by undertaking experiments designed
    to replicate expert policy assessments with non-expert Crowds recruited from Virtual
    Labor Markets. We use a set of ninety-six climate change adaptation policy measures
    previously evaluated by experts in the Netherlands as our control condition to
    conduct experiments using two discrete sets of non-expert Crowds recruited from
    Virtual Labor Markets. We vary the composition of our non-expert Crowds along
    two conditions: participants recruited from a geographical location directly relevant
    to the policy context and participants recruited at-large. We discuss our research
    methods in detail and provide the findings of our experiments.'

  abstract: 'This short article argues that an adequate response to the implications
    for governance raised by ‘Big Data’ requires much more attention to agency and
    reflexivity than theories of ‘algorithmic power’ have so far allowed. It develops
    this through two contrasting examples: the sociological study of social actors
    used of analytics to meet their own social ends (for example, by community organisations)
    and the study of actors’ attempts to build an economy of information more open
    to civic intervention than the existing one (for example, in the environmental
    sphere). The article concludes with a consideration of the broader norms that
    might contextualise these empirical studies, and proposes that they can be understood
    in terms of the notion of voice, although the practical implementation of voice
    as a norm means that voice must sometimes be considered via the notion of transparency.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents an alternative approach to existing and widely used
    correlation metrics through the use of orientation information. The gradient field
    correlation method presented here utilises derivative of Gaussian (DoG) operators
    for estimating directional derivatives of an image for two matching applications:
    classical planar object detection and point correspondence matching. The experimental
    results confirm that a suitably normalised gradient vector field, which emphasises
    gradient direction information in an image, leads to better selectivity when applied
    to classical template matching problems. For the case of establishing point correspondences,
    combinations of gradient vector field metrics yield higher in lying match percentages
    (by RANSAC) relative to normalised cross-correlation with little extra computational
    cost, particularly at smaller patch sizes. It is also shown that pixel-wise field
    component normalisation is critical to the success of this approach.'

  abstract: |-
    In 2011, the Department of Interior and Local Government of the Philippines mandated the implementation of the Full Disclosure Policy that requires local government units (LGUs) to post financial and procurement –related information in LGU websites. To date, more than 75% of the local government units in the country have complied. This research investigates whether the provision of local government information through government websites has affected both the providers of the information and its supposed audience – the public, as represented by citizen groups. To answer the questions, the researchers made use of a case study approach by selecting three provinces as research sites. The primary methods used were review of secondary data, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews.
    The research found out two major significant findings. On the supply side, incentivising openness is a critical aspect in ensuring that local governments have the interest to disclose financial data. While at this stage, local governments are still on compliance behaviour, it encourages the once reluctant LGUs to disclose financial information in the use of public funds, especially when technology and institutional arrangements are in place. However, LGUs do not make an effort to inform the public that information is available online and has not made data accessible in such a way that it can allow the public to perform computations and analysis. Currently, no data standards have been made yet by the Philippine national government in terms of format and level of detail. On the demand side, there is limited awareness on the part of the public, and more particularly the intermediaries (e.g. business groups, civil society organizations, research institutions), on the availability of data, and thus, its limited use. As most of these data are financial in nature, it requires a certain degree of competence and expertise so that they will be able to make use of the data in demanding from government better services and accountability.
    This paper argues that openness is not just about governments putting meaningful government data out into the public domain, but also about making the public meaningfully engage with governments through the use of open government data. This requires policies that will require observance of open government data standards and a capacity building process of ensuring that the public, to whom the data is intended, are aware and able to use the data in ensuring more transparent and accountable governance.

  abstract: Not long ago I visited the Personal Genome Project's website. The PGP
    describes its mission as “creating public genome, health, and trait data.” In
    the “Participant Profiles” section, I found several entries that disclosed the
    names of individuals along with their date of birth, sex, weight, height, blood
    type, race, health conditions, medications, allergies, medical procedures, and
    more. Other profiles did not feature names but provided all of the other details.
    I had no special access to this information. It is available to absolutely anyone
    with Internet access. The PGP is part of a trend known as “open data.” Many government
    and private entities have launched initiatives to compile very large data resources
    (also known as “big data”) and to make them available to the public. President
    Obama himself has endorsed open data by issuing a May 2013 executive order directing
    that, to the extent permitted by law, the federal government must release its
    data to the public in forms that make it easy to locate, access, and use.

  abstract: A growing range of public, private and civic organisations, from Unicef
    through Nesta to Tesco, now run units known as ‘innovation labs’. The hopeful
    assumption they share is that labs, by building on openness among other features,
    can generate promising solutions to grand challenges of the future. Despite their
    seeming proliferation and popularisation, the underlying innovation paradigm embodied
    by labs has so far received scant academic attention. This is a missed opportunity,
    because innovation labs are potentially fruitful vehicles for leveraging openness
    for radical innovation. Indeed, they not only strive to span organisational, sectoral
    and geographical boundaries by bringing a variety of uncommon actors together
    to embrace radical ideas and out-of-the box thinking, but they also aim to apply
    the concept of openness throughout the innovation process, including the experimentation
    and development phases. While the phenomenon of labs clearly forms part of a broader
    trend towards openness, it seems to transcend traditional conceptualisations of
    open innovation (Chesbrough, 2006), open strategy (Whittington et al., 2011),
    open science (David, 1998) or open government (Janssen et al., 2012). What are
    innovation labs about, how do they differ from other innovation efforts and how
    do they embrace openness to create breakthrough innovations? This short exploratory
    paper is an introduction to a larger empirical study aiming to answer these questions.

  abstract: |-
    In this extraordinary follow-up to the critically acclaimed The Lucifer Principle, Howard Bloom-one of today's preeminent thinkers-offers us a bold rewrite of the evolutionary saga. He shows how plants and animals (including humans) have evolved together as components of a worldwide learning machine. He describes the network of life on Earth as one that is, in fact, a ""complex adaptive system,"" a global brain in which each of us plays a sometimes conscious, sometimes unknowing role. and he reveals that the World Wide Web is just the latest step in the development of this brain. These are theories as important as they are radical. Informed by twenty years of interdisciplinary research, Bloom takes us on a spellbinding journey back to the big bang to let us see how its fires forged primordial sociality. As he brings us back via surprising routes, we see how our earliest bacterial ancestors built multitrillion-member research and development teams a full 3.5 billion years ago. We watch him unravel the previously unrecognized strands of interconnectedness woven by crowds of trilobites, hunting packs of dinosaurs, feathered flying lizards gathered in flocks, troops of baboons making communal decisions, and adventurous tribes of protohumans spreading across continents but still linked by primitive forms of information networking. We soon find ourselves reconsidering our place in the world. Along the way, Bloom offers us exhilarating insights into the strange tricks of body and mind that have organized a variety of life forms: spiny lobsters, which, during the Paleozoic age, participated in communal marching rituals; and bees, which, during the age of dinosaurs, conducted collective brainwork. This fascinating tour continues on to the sometimes brutal subculture wars that have spurred the growth of human civilization since the Stone Age. Bloom shows us how culture shapes our infant brains, immersing us in a matrix of truth and mass delusion that we think of as reality.

    Global Brain is more than just a brilliantly original contribution to the ongoing debate on the inner workings of evolution. It is a ""grand vision,"" says the eminent evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson, a work that transforms our very view of who we are and why.

  abstract: |-
    In this project, we analyzed whether mobile phone-based surveys are a feasible and cost-effective approach for gathering statistically representative information in four low-income countries (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe). Speci cally, we focused on three primary research questions. First, can the mobile phone survey platform reach a nationally representative sample? Second, to what extent does linguistic fractionalization affect the ability to produce
    a representative sample? Third, how effectively does monetary compensation impact survey completion patterns?

  abstract: |-
    Open government data (OGD) as a concept is gaining currency globally due to the strong advocacy of global organisations as Open Government Partnership. In recent years, there has been increased commitment on the part of national governments to proactively disclose information. However, much of the discussion on OGD is at the national level, especially in developing countries where commitments of proactive disclosure is conditioned by the commitments of national governments as expressed through the OGP national action plans. However, the local is important in the context of open data. In decentralized contexts, the local is where data is collected and stored, where there is strong feasibility that data will be published, and where data can generate the most impact when used. This synthesis paper wants to refocus the discussion of open government data in sub-national contexts by analysing nine country papers produced through the Open Data in Developing Countries research project.

    Using a common research framework that focuses on context, governance setting, and open data initiatives, the study found out that there is substantial effort on the part of sub-national governments to proactively disclose data, however, the design delimits citizen participation, and eventually, use. Second, context demands diff erent roles for intermediaries and diff erent types of initiatives to create an enabling environment for open data. Finally, data quality will remain a critical challenge for sub-national governments in developing countries and it will temper potential impact that open data will be able to generate.

  abstract: Despite the availability of a myriad of Information and Communication
    Technologies (ICT) based tools and methodologies for supporting governance and
    the formulation of policies, including modelling expected impacts, these have
    proved to be unable to cope with the dire challenges of the contemporary society.
    In this chapter we present the results of the analysis of a set of promising cases
    researched in order to understand the possible impact of what we define ‘Policy
    Making 2.0’, which refers to ‘a set of methodologies and technological solutions
    aimed at enabling better, timely and participative policy-making’. Based on the
    analysis of these cases we suggest a bouquet of (mostly ICT-related) practical
    and research recommendations that are relevant to researchers, practitioners and
    policy makers in order to guide the introduction and implementation of Policy
    Making 2.0 initiatives. We argue that this ‘decalogue’ of Policy Making 2.0 could
    be an operational checklist for future research and policy to further explore
    the potential of ICT tools for governance and policy modelling, so to make next
    generation policy making more ‘intelligent’ and hopefully able to solve or anticipate
    the societal challenges we are (and will be) confronted today and in the future.

    Background: Investigation into personal health has become focused on conditions at an increasingly local level, while response rates have declined and complicated the process of collecting data at an individual level. Simultaneously, social media data have exploded in availability and have been shown to correlate with the prevalence of certain health conditions.

    Objective: Facebook likes may be a source of digital data that can complement traditional public health surveillance systems and provide data at a local level. We explored the use of Facebook likes as potential predictors of health outcomes and their behavioral determinants.

    Methods: We performed principal components and regression analyses to examine the predictive qualities of Facebook likes with regard to mortality, diseases, and lifestyle behaviors in 214 counties across the United States and 61 of 67 counties in Florida. These results were compared with those obtainable from a demographic model. Health data were obtained from both the 2010 and 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and mortality data were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System.
    Results: Facebook likes added significant value in predicting most examined health outcomes and behaviors even when controlling for age, race, and socioeconomic status, with model fit improvements (adjusted R2) of an average of 58% across models for 13 different health-related metrics over basic sociodemographic models. Small area data were not available in sufficient abundance to test the accuracy of the model in estimating health conditions in less populated markets, but initial analysis using data from Florida showed a strong model fit for obesity data (adjusted R2=.77).

    Conclusions: Facebook likes provide estimates for examined health outcomes and health behaviors that are comparable to those obtained from the BRFSS. Online sources may provide more reliable, timely, and cost-effective county-level data than that obtainable from traditional public health surveillance systems as well as serve as an adjunct to those systems.

    institutional, political notions of transparency that we are concerned with in
    our area of institutional or political transparency? Or put more simply and zooming
    in on one core aspect of the conversation: what have the arrival of glass and
    its siblings done for democracy and what can we still hope they will do for open,
    transparent governance now and in the future?'

  abstract: 'Geographic data and tools are essential in all aspects of emergency management:
    preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. Geographic information created
    by amateur citizens, often known as volunteered geographic information, has recently
    provided an interesting alternative to traditional authoritative information from
    mapping agencies and corporations, and several recent papers have provided the
    beginnings of a literature on the more fundamental issues raised by this new source.
    Data quality is a major concern, since volunteered information is asserted and
    carries none of the assurances that lead to trust in officially created data.
    During emergencies time is the essence, and the risks associated with volunteered
    information are often outweighed by the benefits of its use. An example is discussed
    using the four wildfires that impacted the Santa Barbara area in 2007–2009, and
    lessons are drawn'

  abstract: The exponential growth of available information about routine police activities
    offers new opportunities to improve the fairness and effectiveness of police practices.
    We illustrate the point by showing how a particular kind of calculation made possible
    by modern, large-scale datasets — determining the likelihood that stopping and
    frisking a particular pedestrian will result in the discovery of contraband or
    other evidence of criminal activity — could be used to reduce the racially disparate
    impact of pedestrian searches and to increase their effectiveness. For tools of
    this kind to achieve their full potential in improving policing, though, the legal
    system will need to adapt. One important change would be to understand police
    tactics such as investigatory stops of pedestrians or motorists as programs, not
    as isolated occurrences. Beyond that, the judiciary will need to grow more comfortable
    with statistical proof of discriminatory policing, and the police will need to
    be more receptive to the assistance that algorithms can provide in reducing bias.

  abstract: 'This book provides key strategic principles and best practices to guide
    the design and implementation of digital government strategies. It provides a
    series of recommendations and findings to think about IT applications in government
    as a platform for information, services and collaboration, and strategies to avoid
    identified pitfalls. Digital government research suggests that information technologies
    have the potential to generate immense public value and transform the relationships
    between governments, citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders. However, developing
    innovative and high impact solutions for citizens hinges on the development of
    strategic institutional, organizational and technical capabilities. Thus far,
    particular characteristics and problems of the public sector organization promote
    the development of poorly integrated and difficult to maintain applications. For
    example, governments maintain separate applications for open data, transparency,
    and public services, leading to duplication of efforts and a waste of resources.
    The costs associated with maintaining such sets of poorly integrated systems may
    limit the use of resources to future projects and innovation. This book provides
    best practices and recommendations based on extensive research in both Mexico
    and the United States on how governments can develop a digital government strategy
    for creating public value, how to finance digital innovation in the public sector,
    how to build successful collaboration networks and foster citizen engagement,
    and how to correctly implement open government projects and open data. It will
    be of interest to researchers, practitioners, students and the public sector IT
    professionals that work in the design and implementation of technology-based project
    and programs. '

  abstract: In this paper, published at CHI ’17, we examine deliberative quality of
    crowdsourced deliberation. Analyzing data from two crowdsourced policy-making
    processes, we found a good quality deliberation with respect, reciprocity, and
    storytelling according to the standards in the theory of deliberative democracy.
    We identified a group of super-deliberators, whose deliberation was above the
    average, and low-quality deliberators, whose deliberation was below the average.
    The findings show that even when crowdsourced policymaking was not designed for
    deliberation, it can facilitate a fairly high-quality democratic deliberation.

  abstract: In an era of increasing dependence on data science and big data, the voices
    of one set of major stakeholders - the world's children and those who advocate
    on their behalf - have been largely absent. A recent paper estimates one in three
    global internet users is a child, yet there has be little rigorous debate or understanding
    of how to adapt traditional, offline ethical standards for research involving
    data collection from children, to a big data, online environment (Livingstone
    et al., 2015). This paper argues that due to the potential for severe, long-lasting
    and differential impacts on children, child reights need to be firmly integrated
    onto the agendas of global debates about ethics and data science. The authors
    outline their rationale for a greater focus on child rights and ethics in data
    science and suggest steps to move forward, focusing on the various actors within
    the data chain including data generators, collectors, analysts and end-users.
    It concludes by calling for a much stronger appreciation of the links between
    child rights, ethics and data science disciplines and for enhanced discourse between
    stakeholders in the data chain, and those responsible for upholding the rights
    of children, globally.

  abstract: Can today's city govern well if its citizens lack modern technology? How
    important is access to computers for lowering unemployment? What infrastructure
    does a city have to build in order to attract new business? Michael A. Pagano
    curates engagement with such questions by public intellectuals, academics, policy
    analysts, and citizens. Each essay explores the impact and opportunities technology
    provides in government and citizenship, health care, workforce development, service
    delivery to citizens, and metropolitan growth. As the authors show, rapidly emerging
    technologies and access to such technologies shape the ways people and institutions
    interact in the public sphere and private marketplace. The direction of metropolitan
    growth and development, in turn, depends on access to appropriate technology scaled
    and informed by the individual, household, and community needs of the region.

  abstract: 'Participation is a concept and practice that governs many aspects of
    new media and new publics. There are a wide range of attempts to create more of
    it and a surprising lack of theorization. In this paper I attempt to present a
    “grammar” of participation by looking at three cases where participation has been
    central in the contemporary moment of new, social media and the Internet as well
    as in the past, stretching back to the 1930s: citizen participation in public
    administration, workplace participation, and participatory international development.
    Across these three cases I demonstrate that the grammar of participation shifts
    from a language of normative enthusiasm to one of critiques of co-optation and
    bureaucratization and back again. I suggest that this perpetually aspirational
    logic results in the problem of “too much democracy in all the wrong places.”'

  abstract: |-
    Citizen engagement in the Netherlands is formalised at both national and local levels. The legal avenues for citizen engagement at the national level consist primarily of agenda-setting and advisory direct voting mechanisms such as citizen petitions and referenda. At the local level, citizens have a more diverse array of opportunities to engage in policy development. Yet, the availability of these opportunities depends on local administrative arrangements and as such it varies from place to place.

    This report aims at providing an overview of the normative and institutional state of art of ICT-mediated citizen participation in the Netherlands. The first section provides an overview of the political and civic liberties framework in the Netherlands. In the second section the landscape of ICT mediated citizen engagement is mapped. In the third section, the report engages with the implications of technology mediations for deliberative democracy and transformative citizenship.

    Data is often referred to as the 'new oil' - the 21st century raw material which, when hitched to algorithmic refinement, may be mined for insight and value - and 'data flows' are said to have exerted a greater impact upon global growth than traditional goods flows in recent years (Manyika et al, 2016). Small wonder, then, that governments around the world are endeavouring to strike a balance between individual privacy rights and protections on the one hand, and organizational permissions to facilitate the creation of social, economic and environmental value from broad-ranging data on the other hand: 'data rights' are now of critical importance courtesy of technological advancements. The tension between the two between the two is particularly evidence where health and care data in the UK is concerned. Individuals are broadly content with anonymized data from their medical records being used for public benefit but are, understandably, anxious about the implications of the most intimate aspects of their lives being hacked or, else, shared without their knowledge or consent.

    This report recommends additional support for digitization efforts in social care settings. They call upon the government to streamline processes associated with Information Governance (IG) modelling to help data sharing initiatives that traverse organizational boundaries. They also advocate for investment and additional legal safeguards to make more anonymized data shets available for research and innovation. Crucially, we recommend expediting the scope for individuals to contribute health and care data to sharing initiatives led by the public sector through promotion, education and pilot activities - so that data is deployed to transform public health and support the 'pivot to prevention.'

  abstract: |-
    Today, the generation and use of huge volumes of data are redefining our “intelligence” capacity and our social and economic landscapes, spurring new industries, processes and products, and creating significant competitive advantages. In this sense, data-driven innovation (DDI) has become a key pillar of 21st-century growth, with the potential to significantly enhance productivity, resource efficiency, economic competitiveness, and social well-being.

    Greater access to and use of data create a wide array of impacts and policy challenges, ranging from privacy and consumer protection to open access issues and measurement concerns, across public and private health, legal and science domains. This report aims to improve the evidence base on the role of DDI for promoting growth and well-being, and provide policy guidance on how to maximise the benefits of DDI and mitigate the associated economic and societal risks.

  abstract: Respect for privacy and the individual’s right to control their own data
    is becoming a key competitive parameter. Companies, organisations and authorities
    that treat data ethics as a social responsibility as important as environmental
    awareness and respect for human rights are tomorrow’s winners. Digital trust is
    paramount for digital growth and welfare. This book combines broad trend analysis
    with case studies of companies working with data ethics to varying degrees. The
    authors make the case how citizens and consumers are no longer just concerned
    about their lack of control over data, but also have begun to act, and how alternative
    business models, advances in technology and a new European data protection regulation
    combined foster a growing market for data ethical products and services. It provides
    a critical and fresh look at tech trends and the ethical dilemmas intertwined
    with them. It is a book for responsible players on how to get started with data
    ethics and how to use it to develop digital trust. The book is supported by Internet
    Society (isoc.org).

  abstract: This powerful resource identifies wide-scale health challenges facing
    a rapidly urbanizing planet--including key concerns in nutrition, health status,
    health care, and safety--and strategies toward possible solutions. Theoretical
    and empirical analysis focuses on maximizing the benefits of urban living and
    minimizing negative outcomes across areas for improvement (health education, maternal
    and child health) and threats to well-being (noise pollution, drug counterfeiting).
    For each challenge, contributors discuss implications for health, specific practices
    that fuel them, and emerging ideas for solving them efficiently and effectively.
    Not only are these issues of immediate salience, they will become dangerously
    urgent in years to come.

  abstract: The movements by national governments, funding agencies, universities,
    and research communities toward “open data” face many difficult challenges. In
    high-level visions of open data, researchers’ data and metadata practices are
    expected to be robust and structured. The integration of the internet into scientific
    institutions amplifies these expectations. When examined critically, however,
    the data and metadata practices of scholarly researchers often appear incomplete
    or deficient. The concepts of “accountability” and “transparency” provide insight
    in understanding these perceived gaps. Researchers’ primary accountabilities are
    related to meeting the expectations of research competency, not to external standards
    of data deposition or metadata creation. Likewise, making data open in a transparent
    way can involve a significant investment of time and resources with no obvious
    benefits. This paper uses differing notions of accountability and transparency
    to conceptualize “open data” as the result of ongoing achievements, not one-time
    acts.

  abstract: |-
    This paper details findings from an original survey of approximately 1,000 South African councillors in 2016 and 2017 to explore what representation and accountability looks like from their perspective. How do they understand the various links in the accountability chain, including citizen input and deliberation, norms of good government and pressures from political parties, friends and family? The quality of democratic accountability, and the success of interventions to improve citizen representation, may depend on the norms and beliefs held by elected representatives.

    Findings suggest that even in a political context defined by strong parties, the descriptive representation of South African politicians has important substantive implications. Individual-level characteristics such as the race, gender, wealth and age of councillors meaningfully predict attitudes and perceptions on a range of important questions about voice and accountability.

  abstract: National identity programs are increasingly being introduced into low
    and middle income countries, and may be used by governments for surveillance,
    supporting fair and democratic elections, fostering national unity, and facilitating
    health, financial and agricultural transactions. We review evidence on 42 national
    ID programs in low- and middle-income countries, with particular attention to
    evidence of the implementation challenges the programs have faced. We identify
    seven general categories of implementation challenges, with evidence that 39 of
    42 countries have faced at least one category of challenge while 8 countries have
    faced challenges in three or more areas. Further, we observe some associations
    between country and national ID program characteristics and evidence of particular
    implementation challenges. Better understanding of the challenges that countries
    have faced in implementing national ID programs may support the development of
    more sustainable and usable ID programs.

    We are living in the age of cities. It is an urgent time, and an uncertain one. Never before have human beings built so much with such haste. Yet we understand so little about how our urban world grows — and sometimes — declines.

    To meet this challenge, the world’s universities have set out to plug this knowledge gap, and establish a new science of cities. This report is an initial attempt to understand the collective scope and impact of this movement. What does this new science seek to achieve? Who are its practitioners? What questions are they pursuing? What methods do they use? What are they learning? How might their discoveries shape our shared urban destiny?

  abstract: |-
    Measurement and evaluation is core to good impact practice. It helps us understand what works, how it works, and how we can achieve more. Good measurement and evaluation involves reflective, creative, and proportionate approaches. It makes the most of existing theoretical frameworks as well as new digital solutions, and focuses on learning and improving. We researched the latest changes in theory and practice based on both new and old, renascent ideas. We spoke to leading evaluation experts from around the world, to as what's exciting them, what people are talking about, and what is most likely to make a long lasting contribution to evaluation. We found that new thinking, techniques, and technology are influencing and improving practice.

    Technology is enabling us to gather different types of data on bigger scales, helping us gain insights or spot patterns we could not see before. Advances in systems to capture, manage and share sensitive data are helping organizations that want to work collaboratively, while moves toward open data are providing better access to data that can be linked together to generate even greater insight. Traditional models of evaluating a project once it has finished are being overtaken by methods that feed more dynamically into service design. We are learning from the private sector, where real-time feedback shapes business decisions on an ongoing basis asking: 'is it working?' instead of 'did it work?'.

    This report highlights the developments that we think have the greatest potential to improve evaluation and program design, and the careful collection and use of data. We want to celebrate what is possible, and encourage wider application of these ideas. Choosing the innovations in deciding which trends to include in this report, we considered various approaches for better evaluation.

  abstract: 'This editorial introduces a special issue resulting from a panel on Internet
    and policy organized by the Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford) at
    the 2015 International Conference on Public Policy (ICPP) held in Milan. Two main
    themes emerged from the panel: the challenges of high cost and low participation
    which many e-participation initiatives have faced; and the potential Big Data
    seems to hold for remedying these problems. This introduction briefly presents
    these themes and links them to the papers in the issue. It argues that Big Data
    can fix some of the problems typically encountered by e-participation initiatives:
    it can offer a solution to the problem of low turnout which is furthermore accessible
    to government bodies even if they have low levels of financial resources. However,
    the use of Big Data in this way is also a radically different approach to the
    problem of involving citizens in policymaking; and the editorial concludes by
    reflecting on the significance of this for the policymaking process.'

  abstract: A bottom-up approach to smart cities places citizens in an active role
    of contributing, analysing and interpreting data in pursuit of tackling local
    urban challenges and building a more sustainable future city. This vision can
    only be realised if citizens have sufficient data literacy skills and experience
    of large, complex, messy, ever expanding data sets. Schools typically focus on
    teaching data handling skills using small, personally collected data sets obtained
    through scientific experimentation, leading to a gap between what is being taught
    and what will be needed as big data and analytics become more prevalent. This
    paper proposes an approach to teaching data literacy in the context of urban innovation
    tasks, using an idea of Urban Data Games. These are supported by a set of training
    data and resources that will be used in school trials for exploring the problems
    people have when dealing with large data and trialling novel approaches for teaching
    data literacy.

  abstract: Information of all kinds is now being produced, collected, and analyzed
    at unprecedented speed, breadth, depth, and scale. The capacity to collect and
    analyze massive data sets has already transformed fields such as biology, astronomy,
    and physics, but the social sciences have been comparatively slower to adapt,
    and the path forward is less certain. For many, the big data revolution promises
    to ask, and answer, fundamental questions about individuals and collectives, but
    large data sets alone will not solve major social or scientific problems. New
    paradigms being developed by the emerging field of “computational social science”
    will be needed not only for research methodology, but also for study design and
    interpretation, cross-disciplinary collaboration, data curation and dissemination,
    visualization, replication, and research ethics (Lazer et al., 2009). SAGE Publishing
    conducted a survey with social scientists around the world to learn more about
    researchers engaged in big data research and the challenges they face, as well
    as the barriers to entry for those looking to engage in this kind of research
    in the future. We were also interested in the challenges of teaching computational
    social science methods to students. The survey was fully completed by 9412 respondents,
    indicating strong interest in this topic among our social science contacts. Of
    respondents, 33 percent had been involved in big data research of some kind and,
    of those who have not yet engaged in big data research, 49 percent (3057 respondents)
    said that they are either “definitely planning on doing so in the future” or “might
    do so in the future.”

    Within the governance arena, many ICT-enabled interventions focus on raising citizens’ voices with government. They aim to make it easier for citizens to feed in their views, needs, ideas or complaints by giving them the digital means to do so.

    This programme learning report presents and discusses findings from Making All Voices Count, a grant-making programme that has supported tech for accountable governance initiatives and research. It focuses on ICT-enabled ‘citizen voice–government responsiveness interventions’, especially feedback platforms in the global south. However, Making All Voices Count highlights that many such interventions do not deliver on expectations.

  abstract: Despite heavy investment by the United States and several other national
    governments, terrorism related problems are rising at an alarming rate. Lone-wolf
    terrorism, in particular, in the last decade, has caused 70% of all terrorism
    related deaths in the US and the West. This literature survey describes lone-wolf
    terrorism in detail to analyse its structure, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses.
    It also investigates crowdsourcing intelligence, as an unorthodox approach to
    counter lone-wolf terrorism, by reviewing its current state-of-the-art and identifying
    the areas for improvement

  abstract: |
    Recognizing the potential of data innovation, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) innovation teams at the Regional Centre for Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (ECIS) and the Regional Hub for Arab States embarked on a “big data for development exploration journey,” seeking to harness new sources of data to improve services or programme implementation on topics including disaster risk management, improved welfare, migration, and poverty reduction. As part of this exercise, six UNDP Offices from the two regions developed data innovation proof-of-concept projects with governmental and civil society partners, to address urgent local challenges and gain hands-on experience in data innovation.

    UN Global Pulse provided technical guidance, coaching and tools to the project managers for the duration of the exercise, and the cohort shared advice and challenges at in-person workshops. This guide is based on these experiences, and on the methodology created by Global Pulse to design and implement data innovation projects across the UN system.

    The joint exercise showed how alternative sources of data can and should play a role in pursuing development outcomes and, as such, hold great promise for ful lling the Sustainable Development Goals—both from the perspective of pursuing the outcomes as well as enabling (close to) real-time monitoring and evaluation.

  abstract: How will big data impact environmental law in the near future? This Essay
    imagines one possible future for environmental law in 2030 that focuses on the
    implications of big data for the protection of public health from risks associated
    with pollution and industrial chemicals. It assumes the perspective of an historian
    looking back from the end of the twenty-first century at the evolution of environmental
    law during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The premise of
    the Essay is that big data will drive a major shift in the underlying knowledge
    practices of environmental law (along with other areas of law focused on health
    and safety). This change in the epistemic foundations of environmental law, it
    is argued, will in turn have important, far-reaching implications for environmental
    law’s normative commitments and for its ability to discharge its statutory responsibilities.
    In particular, by significantly enhancing the ability of environmental regulators
    to make harm more visible and more traceable, big data will put considerable pressure
    on previous understandings of acceptable risk across populations, pushing toward
    a more singular and more individualized understanding of harm. This will raise
    new and difficult questions regarding environmental law’s capacity to confront
    and take responsibility for the actual lives caught up in the tragic choices it
    is called upon to make. In imagining this near future, the Essay takes a somewhat
    exaggerated and, some might argue, overly pessimistic view of the implications
    of big data for environmental law’s efforts to protect public health. This is
    done not out of a conviction that such a future is likely, but rather to highlight
    some of the potential problems that may arise as big data becomes a more prominent
    part of environmental protection. In an age of data triumphalism, such a perspective,
    it is hoped, may provide grounds for a more critical engagement with the tools
    and knowledge practices that inform environmental law and the implications of
    those tools for environmental law’s ability to meet its obligations. Of course,
    there are other possible futures, and big data surely has the potential to make
    many positive contributions to environmental protection in the coming decades.
    Whether it will do so will depend in no small part on the collective choices we
    make to manage these new capabilities in the years ahead.

  abstract: Public sector agencies routinely store large volumes of information about
    individuals in the community. The storage and analysis of this information benefits
    society, as it enables relevant agencies to make better informed decisions and
    to address the individual's needs more appropriately. Members of the public often
    assume that the authorities are well equipped to handle personal data; however,
    due to implementation errors and lack of data governance, this is not always the
    case. This paper reports on an audit conducted in Western Australia, focusing
    on findings in the Police Firearms Management System and the Department of Health
    Information System. In the case of the Police, the audit revealed numerous data
    protection issues leading the auditors to report that they had no confidence in
    the accuracy of information on the number of people licensed to possess firearms
    or the number of licensed firearms. Similarly alarming conclusions were drawn
    in the Department of Health as auditors found that they could not determine which
    medical staff member was responsible for clinical data entries made. The paper
    describes how these issues often do not arise from existing business rules or
    the technology itself, but a lack of sound data governance. Finally, a discussion
    section presents key data governance principles and best practices that may guide
    practitioners involved in data management. These cases highlight the very real
    data management concerns, and the associated recommendations provide the context
    to spark further interest in the applied aspects of data protection.

  abstract: 'The technological, economic, and social changes of recent years have
    required governments to adapt to new challenges and growing demands from civil
    society. In many countries, and at different levels of government, this has led
    to the creation of innovation labs that aim to promote various modes of innovation
    within the public sector. This paper analyzes the roles of innovation labs in
    Latin America, examines the challenges, and compares them to best practices and
    characteristics that current literature associates with higher levels of innovation
    in the public sector and in other organizations. Based on a survey of lab directors
    and the undertaking of two case studies, this paper describes the scope of innovation
    labs in Latin America and discusses the challenges they face to (i) overcome key
    management issues, (ii) promote the adoption and scale up of innovation, and (iii)
    ensure its sustainability. There are four key factors that determine the success
    of innovation in overcoming these challenges: two of these are of a political
    and institutional nature, namely leadership support and political networks, while
    the other two relate to lab methodologies, namely the technical adaptation of
    innovation and the building of a shared meaning. Additionally, two major differences
    have been identified between the innovation labs discussed herein and those of
    other regions, as described in the existing literature: a greater focus on issues
    of open government and less rigorous testing of innovation, such as randomized
    experimentation and impact evaluation. Lastly, this study provides the relevant
    conclusions and recommendations on how to establish innovation labs as effective
    channels to manage innovation in government, along with its inherent risks, and
    modernize public administration.'

  abstract: The public-oriented goals of the open government movement promise increased
    transparency and accountability of governments, enhanced citizen engagement and
    participation, improved service delivery, economic development and the stimulation
    of innovation. In part, these goals are to be achieved by making more and more
    government information public in reusable formats and under open licences. This
    paper identifies three broad privacy challenges raised by open government. The
    first is how to balance privacy with transparency and accountability in the context
    of “public” personal information. The second challenge flows from the disruption
    of traditional approaches to privacy based on a collapse of the distinctions between
    public and private sector actors. The third challenge is that of the potential
    for open government data—even if anonymized—to contribute to the big data environment
    in which citizens and their activities are increasingly monitored and profiled.

  abstract: |-
    In the field of business and finance, financial institutions utilize algorithms in complex mathematical models to create predictive risk models. These algorithmic models, or finance risk models, can be found throughout the financial marketplace to assist in credit decision problem solving. Notwithstanding their widespread use, finance risk models with their intellectual property proprietary protections lack transparency in their usage and insufficient regulatory control in their applications.

    Finance risk models are used to predict risks, to compute probabilities in credit decision making outcomes, to predict marketplace movement of financial assets, to determine credit scores for individuals, and even to assess the worthiness of credit derivatives, or default probability of bundled mortgages for sale to investors. Particularly troublesome for the individual is the use of these predictive risk models in credit scoring. The trade secrecy surrounding credit scoring risk models, and the misuse of the models coupled with the lack of governmental control concerning their use, contributed to a financial industry wide recession (2007-2008). The lack of transparency and the legal environment led to the use of these risk models as predatory credit pricing instruments as opposed to accurate credit scoring predictive instruments. As a result, the combination of faulty credit scoring and trade secrecy laws helped to scuttle the financial marketplace of 2007-2008. Without a change in this financial and legal environment, these events could occur again. This article explores the use of finance risk models in credit scoring, the misuse of credit scoring models, and the lack of transparency and governmental regulation concerning credit scoring for the individual.

  abstract: The paper explores the motivations of volunteers in a large crowd sourcing
    project and contributes to our understanding of the motivational factors that
    lead to deeper engagement beyond initial participation. Drawing on the theory
    of legitimate peripheral participation (LPP) and the literature on motivation
    in crowd sourcing, we analyze interview and trace data from a large citizen science
    project. The analyses identify ways in which the technical features of the projects
    may serve as motivational factors leading participants towards sustained participation.
    The results suggest volunteers first engage in activities to support knowledge
    acquisition and later share knowledge with other volunteers and finally increase
    participation in Talk through a punctuated process of role discovery.

    on the everyday aspects of data capture, processing and utilization. However,
    as algorithms become increasingly autonomous and invisible, they become harder
    for the public to detect and scrutinize their impartiality status. Algorithms
    can systematically introduce inadvertent bias, reinforce historical discrimination,
    favor a political orientation or reinforce undesired practices. Yet it is difficult
    to hold algorithms accountable as they continuously evolve with technologies,
    systems, data and people, the ebb and flow of policy priorities, and the clashes
    between new and old institutional logics. Greater openness and transparency do
    not necessarily improve understanding. In this editorial we argue that through
    unravelling the imperceptibility, materiality and governmentality of how algorithms
    work, we can better tackle the inherent challenges in the curatorial practice
    of data and algorithm. Fruitful avenues for further research on using algorithm
    to harness the merits and utilities of a computational form of technocratic governance
    are presented.

  abstract: "Data-driven innovation has great potential for the development of innovative
    services that not only have economic value, but that help to address societal
    challenges. Many of these challenges can only be addressed by data sharing of
    public and privately owned data. These public-private data sharing collaborations
    require data governance rules. Data governance can address many barriers, for
    example by deploying a decision model to guide choices regarding data sharing
    resulting in interventions supported by a data sharing platform. Based on a literature
    review of data governance and three use cases for data sharing in the logistics
    sector, we have developed a data sharing decision model from the perspective of
    a data provider. The decision model addresses technical as well as ownership,
    privacy, and economical barriers to sharing publicly and privately owned data
    and subsequently proposes interventions to address these barriers. We found that
    the decision model is useful for identifying and addressing data sharing barriers
    as it is applicable to amongst others privacy and commercial sensitive data.\n\n"

  abstract: For the past three years, the Centre for Information Policy Leadership
    at Hunton & Williams LLP has served as secretariat for the Accountability Project.
    The Accountability Project is the work of an international group of experts that
    includes representatives of privacy enforcement agencies from Europe, North America,
    and the Asia-Pacific region; civil society; academia and business. Its mission
    is to consider how an accountabilitybased system of data protection might be designed.
    The inquiry originally focused on cross-border data transfers, but expanded to
    address how to apply accountability to improve compliance with privacy requirements
    and to enable more flexible information management. This paper reflects the discussions
    and findings of the Accountability Project, and is intended solely to serve as
    a report of the work of that initiative

    (CI) (Nissenbaum 2010) offers a model for conceptualizing privacy that is able

    is capable of capturing the various components of contextual privacy in theory,
    it is challenging to discover and formally express these norms in operational

    of contextual norms. To evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach,
    we conducted an extensive survey on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) with more than
    450 participants and 1400 questions. The paper has three main takeaways: First,
    we demonstrate the ability to generate survey questions corresponding to privacy
    norms within any context. Second, we show that crowdsourcing enables the discovery
    of norms from these questions with strong majoritarian consensus among users.
    Finally, we demonstrate how the norms thus discovered can be encoded into a formal
    logic to automatically verify their consistency.'

  abstract: 'Due to expected benefits such as citizen participation and innovation,
    the release of Public Sector Information as open data is getting increased attention
    on various levels of government. However, currently data release by governments
    is still novel and there is little experience and knowledge thus far about its
    benefits, costs and barriers. This is compounded by a lack of understanding about
    how internal processes influence data release. Our aim in this paper is to get
    a better understanding of these processes and how they influence data release,
    i.e., to find determinants for the release of public sector information. For this
    purpose, we conducted workshops, interviews, questionnaires, desk research and
    practice based cases in the education program of our university, involving six
    local public sector organizations. We find that the way data is stored, the way
    data is obtained and the way data is used by a department are crucial indicators
    for open data release. We conclude with the lessons learned based on our research
    findings. These findings are: we should take a nuanced approach towards data release,
    avoid releasing data for its own sake, and take small incremental steps to explore
    data release.'

    to produce, process, and analyse georeferenced data in real time. This unprecedented
    convergence of geomobile technologies and crowdsourcing methods is opening up
    multiple forms to participate in disaster management tasks. Based on empirical
    research, this paper first proposes a conceptualisation of crowdsourcing roles
    and then analyses methods and tools based on a combination of two variables: (i)
    types of data being processed; (ii) involvement of the crowds. The paper also
    surveys a number of existing platforms and mobile apps leveraging crowdsourcing
    in disaster and emergency management with the aim to contribute to the discussion
    on the advantages and limits of using crowdsourcing methods and tools in these
    areas.'

  abstract: 'It is challenging to assess the long-term effects of policies related
    to the inheritance of wealth, due to the long timescales involved and the importance
    of family-level dynamics. However,agent-based models(ABMs)now provide a useful
    tool for simulating the effects of alternative policies, allowing a quantitative
    comparison to be made. In this paper we describe an ABM simulating the long-term(up
    to 150 years) development of the UK population in terms of births,deaths and the
    passage of wealth through the generations. The parameterisation of the model is
    driven by publicly available data on the demographics of the UK, primarily from
    the Office for National Statistics. We compare two situations: first where wealth
    is inherited directly by the children of the deceased; secondly where wealth is
    placed in descendants’ trusts for the benefit of the second and third generations
    that follow. The simulations show a marked reduction in the Gini coefficient for
    the case where wealth is placed in descendants’ trusts, relative to direct inheritance.
    This result implies that, overall, trusts of this sort act to reduce the level
    of wealth inequality across society. The same effect is seen whether examining
    the adult population as a whole or a single generation.'

  abstract: Since joining the Open Governance Partnership in 2011, South Africa has
    been committed to addressing the 'grand challenge' of open governance through
    improving public services, creating safer communities and increasing accountability.
    This article contrasts this supranational commitment to open governance with accounts
    of citizens' everyday engagement with the state at a micro-level. Based on a year
    of multi-sited ethnography, the article highlights the value of bringing people
    – in this case, HIV-positive citizens living in Khayelitsha, Cape Town – into
    focus through a series of visual participatory processes in which they share their
    experience of public service provision and engagement with the state. The article
    reflects, first, on how citizens 'see' the state in relation to service delivery
    and, second, on how they 'speak' to the state as members of civil society. It
    offers an understanding of how citizens themselves perceive 'open governance'
    in their everyday lives.

  abstract: "In the fields of transportation and land use planning, the public sector
    has long taken the leading role in the collection, analysis, and dissemination
    of data. Often, public data sets drawn from traveler diaries, surveys, and supply-side
    transportation maps were the only way to understand how people move around in
    the built environment - how they get to work, how they drop kids off at school,
    where they choose to work out or relax, and so on.\n\nUsing a mix of primary research
    and expert interviews, this report catalogs emerging data sets related to transportation
    and land use, and assesses the ease by which they can be integrated into how public
    agencies manage the built environment. It finds that there is reason for the hype;
    we have the ability to know more about how humans move around today than any time
    in history. But, despite all the obvious opportunities, not addressing the core
    challenges will limit public agencies’ ability to put all that data to use for
    the collective good. "

    Much of the literature on citizen accountability focuses on citizen voices. This research briefing is one of four which turn the spotlight on the how the state behaves in instances of accountable governance. Each examines a landmark social justice policy process in Africa, asking when and how the state listened, and to which actors; and why, at times, it chose not to listen.

    How far does Kenya’s information and communications technology revolution transform e-government – implementing decisions with the help of ICTs – into e-governance – using ICTs to help make decisions?

    Most of the Kenyan government’s ICT policy initiatives are structured around its Vision 2030, a long-term planning blueprint which rests on three pillars: social, economic and political. The political pillar envisages a democratic system that is issue based, people centred and results oriented, and accountable to the public. Kenya’s ICT revolution is contributing to attaining the goals of the economic and social pillars, but there has not been parallel progress in the political pillar.

  abstract: The generation of large-scale biomedical data is creating unprecedented
    opportunities for basic and translational science. Typically, the data producers
    perform initial analyses, but it is very likely that the most informative methods
    may reside with other groups. Crowdsourcing the analysis of complex and massive
    data has emerged as a framework to find robust methodologies. When the crowdsourcing
    is done in the form of collaborative scientific competitions, known as Challenges,
    the validation of the methods is inherently addressed. Challenges also encourage
    open innovation, create collaborative communities to solve diverse and important
    biomedical problems, and foster the creation and dissemination of well-curated
    data repositories.

  abstract: |-
    Privacy is commonly studied as a private good: my personal data is mine to protect and control, and yours is yours. This conception of privacy misses an important component of the policy problem. An individual who is careless with data exposes not only extensive information about herself, but about others as well. The negative externalities imposed on nonconsenting outsiders by such carelessness can be productively studied in terms of welfare economics. If all relevant individuals maximize private benefit, and expect all other relevant individuals to do the same, neoclassical economic theory predicts that society will achieve a suboptimal level of privacy. This prediction holds even if all individuals cherish privacy with the same intensity. As the theoretical literature would have it, the struggle for privacy is destined to become a tragedy.

    But according to the experimental public-goods literature, there is hope. Like in real life, people in experiments cooperate in groups at rates well above those predicted by neoclassical theory. Groups can be aided in their struggle to produce public goods by institutions, such as communication, framing, or sanction. With these institutions, communities can manage public goods without heavy-handed government intervention. Legal scholarship has not fully engaged this problem in these terms. In this Article, we explain why privacy has aspects of a public good, and we draw lessons from both the theoretical and the empirical literature on public goods to inform the policy discourse on privacy.

    in public trust in 2014. These effects have disrupted public interest research
    since.  To avert similar contagion in other areas of administrative data, repeating
    mistakes must be avoided.  Policy decisions are incrementally expanding children’s
    data collection and use, linking health with education data, and wider data sets.
    Different pathways provide access to data to a wide variety of third parties.  Exploring
    public awareness of confidential pupil data in the Department for Education’s
    (DfE) 20m strong National Pupil Database (NPD) we consider research infrastructure
    in England — data access routes and users, and its foundation on public trust
    and legislation. We gathered qualitative responses from 75 schools, 100 education
    practitioners, 100 parents of children aged 2-19, and from 25 students aged under
    thirty-five. We found familiarity with school census collection, but none with
    where data goes once it leaves local systems. People were surprised by the release
    of sensitive identifiable data to third parties, and that journalists, charities
    and commercial users received data since 2012. Change is needed from policy makers
    and practitioners making our infrastructure fit for data, and a smart future. '

  abstract: 'The world has dramatically changed over the last decade. Almost every
    aspect of our lives is being digitally monitored: from our social networks activity,
    through online shopping habits to healthcare and financial records. The emergence
    of Internet of things and the growing presence of cyberphysical systems only increase
    citizens’ exposure to digital monitoring by commercial enterprises. In order to
    maintain citizens’ right for privacy while still encouraging an evolving digital
    economy, people should be given the right to choose where their data is stored
    and who holds it,a currently unattainable privilege. We propose that through the
    revolution of computing infrastructure, enabled by new computing architectures,
    a healthier competitive environment can thrive. In this environment, companies
    will compete for customers, offering privacy and information control as a service.
    Such competition, when supported by regulation, will empower citizens, allowing
    them to take back control of their data.'

  abstract: "This publication deals with urban crowdsourcing digital tools, which
    are the subject of many experiments, led by public authorities, private actors
    and citizen groups, and which use digital technologies to collect and organize
    new data on cities and urban development.\nWhile these tools give citizens a new
    role as contributors of data, opinions and ideas for urban management and planning,
    their potential in terms of sustainable developement is not a given outcome.  \n\nDigital
    urban crowdsourcing tools offer new opportunities for citizens to produce solutions
    for urban management, design and planning, while contributing to the invention
    of a new space for citizen participation, complementing its traditional forms
    (voting, associative commitment, face-to-face participatory schemes, etc).\n\nTo
    fully realize their potential and to be beneficial for the construction and ownership
    of a shared sustainable urban development project, these tools must be integrated
    into a truly collaborative strategy, involving stakeholders beyond the simple
    digitalization of existing practices.\n\nBy supporting the mobilization of communities
    of concerned users, as well as citizen engagement in urban development, crowdsourcing
    can accompany a transformation in public action, provided it is inscribed in a
    strategy favouring the openness and transparency of urban data and decision-making
    processes."

    This paper starts by making the case for why a data revolution is needed, highlighting the parlous case of data globally, nationally and locally, focusing on social data, and stating why the gaps matter and how they should be plugged (Sections 1 to 3). Next, it discusses the innovative ways in which data are already being produced and used (Section 4). Finally we set out a vision for a fully- edged revolution, with an examination of outstanding challenges (Sections 5 and 6).

    Throughout, the paper highlights examples of a range of different uses for big and small data that are being piloted around the world. Some projects are already improving people’s lives, while others are still works in progress. But they demonstrate that the data revolution is already underway.

  abstract: |-
    The current patterns of production and consumption in the industrialized world are not sustainable. The goods and services we consume cause resource extractions, greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts that are already affecting the conditions of living on Earth. To support the transition toward sustainable consumption patterns, ICT applications that persuade consumers to change their behavior into a “green” direction have been developed in the field of Persuasive Technology (PT). Such persuasive systems, however, have been criticized for two reasons. First, they are often based on the assumption that information (e.g., information on individual energy consumption) causes behavior change, or a change in awareness and attitude that then changes behavior. Second, PT approaches assume that the designer of the system starts from objective criteria for “sustainable” behavior and is able to operationalize them in the context of the application.

    In this chapter, we are exploring the potential of gamification to overcome the limitations of persuasive systems. Gamification, the process of using game elements in a non-game context, opens up a broader design space for ICT applications created to support sustainable consumption. In particular, a gamification-based approach may give the user more autonomy in selecting goals and relating individual action to social interaction. The idea of gamification may also help designers to view the user’s actions in a broader context and to recognize the relevance of different motivational aspects of social interaction, such as competition and cooperation. Based on this discussion we define basic requirements to be used as guidance in gamification- based motivation design for sustainable consumption.

  abstract: A key challenge of developing a generic visual pattern detection system
    is the handling of variability in natural images. Estimation of multiple parameters
    that describe the pose of objects relative to a previously captured view or model
    in the images typically requires a search for an optimum in a high dimensional
    search space. Inspired from a controversial parallel search mechanism in the recent
    literature, the problem is tackled through a new neural circuitry model called
    Monte Carlo Map Seeking Circuit (MC-MSC). This replaces the regular sampling of
    transformation parameters in the original Map Seeking Circuit with a probabilistic
    sampling approach. Another novelty of this work is the ''queuing'' approach which
    serialises the search by a small amount and increases the performance considerably.
    This serialisation approach can also be considered as a rough estimation to the
    ''attentional mechanisms'' known to exist in primate vision strategy.

  abstract: On one hand, unemployment is a central issue in all countries. On the
    other, the economic policies designed to mitigate it are usually built on theoretical
    grounds that are validated at an aggregate level, but have little or no validity
    from a micro point of view. This situation is a cause for concern because policies
    are designed and implemented at the level of individuals and organizations, so
    ignoring realistic micro-mechanisms may lead to undesirable outcomes in the real
    world. Ironically, the data to inform theoretical frameworks at the micro-level
    have existed in labor studies since the 1980s. However, it is only now that we
    count with analytical methods and computational tools to take full advantage of
    it. In this paper, we argue that big data from administrative records, in conjunction
    with network science and agent-computing models, offer new opportunities to inform
    theories of unemployment and improve policies. Based on previous empirical work
    with administrative big data, we introduce a data-driven model of unemployment
    dy­namics that is validated at both the micro- and macro-levels. At a first glance,
    validation at the micro-level seems unnecessary since we focus on aggregate un­employment.
    However, by establishing a connection between our model and the ones commonly
    used to advice policy, we show that overlooking micro-level validity leads to
    erroneous predictions with significant real-world consequences.

  abstract: |-
    In recent years we have witnessed a shift in the innovation landscape of organizations from closed to more open models embracing solutions from the outside. Widespread use of the internet and web 2.0 technologies have made it easier for organizations to connect with their clients, service providers, and the public at large for more collaborative problem solving and innovation. Introduction of the Open Government initiative accompanied by the America Competes Reauthorization Act signaled an unprecedented commitment by the US Federal Government to stimulating more innovation and creativity in problem solving. The policy and legislation empowered agencies to open up their problem solving space beyond their regular pool of contractors in finding solutions to the nation's most complex problems.

    This is an exploratory study of the adoption of challenges as an organizational innovation in public sector organizations. The main objective is to understand and explain how, and under what conditions challenges are being used by federal agencies and departments as a tool to promote innovation. The organizational innovation literature provides the main theoretical foundation for this study, but does not directly address contextual aspects regarding the type of innovation and the type of organization. The guiding framework uses concepts drawn from three literature streams: organizational innovation, open innovation, and public sector innovation.

    Research was conducted using a qualitative case study of challenge.gov. Data was collected from multiple adopting agencies using two primary sources: interviews with challenge managers and administrators and, archival data from the challenge.gov web platform. Related documentation was used to supplement and corroborate the main data. Analysis of the platform archival data revealed four types of challenges falling along a continuum of increasing innovation. The sequence of events, activities and conditions leading to adoption and implementation were represented as a challenge adoption model. Variations among components of the model resulted in three distinct agency groupings represented as a typology of enactments characterized as inertia, application, and change. Thus challenge adoption among agencies with varying missions, operations and conditions leads to varying enactment types and different levels of change.

    This report draws from original empirical research on Map Kibera, a community-based mapping project that takes full advantage of these technologies and similar initiatives, to present key insights and lessons on the challenges of reaching across the two worlds of open source and development to translate technological possibilities into realities. The study highlights issues concerning the sustainability and governance of initiatives relying on citizens as sources of information, particularly those that aim to make information available to others in a new information commons, a shared set of resources available to all. It provides a basis for considering their wider social benefits, the agendas and values of the actors that drive them, the types of partnerships that can sustain them into the future, and the risks introduced through the increased visibility of vulnerable communities supported through these tools.

    This article encapsulates selected themes from the Australian Data to Decisions Cooperative Research Centre's Laws and Policy program. It is the reult of a discussion on the regulation of Big Data, especially focusing on privacy and data protection strategies. It presents four complementary perspectives stemming from governance, law, ethics, and computer science. Big, Linked, and Open Data constitute complex phenomena whose economic and political dimensions require a plurality of instruments to enhance and protect citizens' rights. Some connclusions are offered in the end to foster a more general discussion.

    This article contends that the effective regulation of Big Data requries a combination of legal tools and other instruments of a semantic and algorithmic nature. It commences with a brief discussion of the concept of Big Data and views expressed by Australian and UK participants in a study of big Data use in a law enforcement and national security perspective. The second part of the article highlights the UN's Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy interest in the themes and the focus on their new program on Big Data. UK law reforms regarding authorization of warrants for the exercise of bulk data is discussed in the third part. Reflecting on these developments, the paper closes with an exploration of the complex relationship between law and Big Data and the implications for regulation and governance of Big Data.

  abstract: Changing relations between science and democracy – and controversies over
    issues such as climate change, energy transitions, genetically modified organisms
    and smart technologies – have led to a rapid rise in new forms of public participation
    and citizen engagement. While most existing approaches adopt fixed meanings of
    ‘participation’ and are consumed by questions of method or critiquing the possible
    limits of democratic engagement, this book offers new insights that rethink public
    engagements with science, innovation and environmental issues as diverse, emergent
    and in the making. Bringing together leading scholars on science and democracy,
    working between science and technology studies, political theory, geography, sociology
    and anthropology, the volume develops relational and co-productionist approaches
    to studying and intervening in spaces of participation. New empirical insights
    into the making, construction, circulation and effects of participation across
    cultures are illustrated through examples ranging from climate change and energy
    to nanotechnology and mundane technologies, from institutionalised deliberative
    processes to citizen-led innovation and activism, and from the global north to
    global south. This new way of seeing participation in science and democracy opens
    up alternative paths for reconfiguring and remaking participation in more experimental,
    reflexive, anticipatory and responsible ways.

  abstract: 'In recent years, decision makers have reported difficulties in the use
    of official statistics in public policy: excessively long publication delays,
    insufficient coverage of topics of interest, and the top-down process of data
    creation. The deluge of data available online represents a potential answer to
    these problems, with social media data in particular as a possible alternative
    to traditional data. In this article, we propose a definition of “Soft Data” to
    indicate data that are freely available on the Internet, and that are not controlled
    by a public administration but rather by public or private actors. The term Soft
    Data is not intended to replace those of “Big Data” and “Open Data,” but rather
    to highlight specific properties and research methods required to convert them
    into information of interest for decision makers. The analysis is based on a case
    study of Twitter data for urban policymaking carried out for a European research
    program aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of European cohesion policy. The
    article explores methodological issues and the possible impact of “Soft Data”
    on public policy, reporting on semistructured interviews carried out with nine
    European policymakers.'

    Most organizations spend much of their effort on the start of the value creation process: namely, creating a strategy, developing new products or services, and analyzing the market. They pay a lot less attention to the end: the crucial “last mile” where consumers come to their website, store, or sales representatives and make a choice.

    In The Last Mile, Dilip Soman shows how to use insights from behavioral science in order to close that gap. Beginning with an introduction to the last mile problem and the concept of choice architecture, the book takes a deep dive into the psychology of choice, money, and time. It explains how to construct behavioral experiments and understand the data on preferences that they provide. Finally, it provides a range of practical tools with which to overcome common last mile difficulties.

    Mobile health (mHealth) interventions – in which mobile phones are used to advance positive health outcomes – have only recently been applied to addressing broader questions of health governance. This report discusses research on a mobile phone app that was designed to create a coordinated platform through which rape victims could express their views on the quality of services and support offered by police and health-care workers in South Africa, in order to promote greater accountability between service providers and clients.

    The study, which assessed the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed app, comprised qualitative and quantitative research with rape victims and caregivers accessing follow-up services at four rape care centres in Tshwane district, Pretoria. Of 140 participants enrolled in the study (108 rape victims and 32 caregivers), 86.4% reported owning a mobile phone. However, the results also revealed that mobile phone theft during sexual assault was common, with 34 out of 63 participants (55%) who did not bring their mobile phones to their first visit to the facility reporting that their phone had been stolen during the assault.

  abstract: 'Several open government initiatives have been launched to make available
    online data enhancing accountability of public officials towards ordinary citizens.
    However, these initiatives raise several questions, namely: Which data should
    be disclosed? How to bring together dispersed (fragmented) data? How to improve
    its understandability by ordinary citizens? Literature shows that, in general,
    the data selection process does not take into account ordinary citizens'' expectations
    and information needs. This paper presents the development process of a transparency
    ontology, which aims to provide an answer to the above questions, in what concerns
    public sector entities'' use of resources. The process started by creating a list
    of relevant expressions/terms discussed in national and local newspapers, considering
    the role of journalists as ''information brokers'' acting on behalf of ordinary
    citizens. This list was externally validated for relevance, comprehensiveness
    and improvements by interviewing journalists, and the resulting transparency ontology
    was formalised using OWL and Protégé.'

  abstract: The agriculture sector is creating increasing amounts of data, from many
    different sources. From tractors equipped with GPS tracking, to open data released
    by government ministries, data is becoming ever more valuable, as agricultural
    business development and global food policy decisions are being made based upon
    data. But the sector is also home to severe resource inequality. The largest agricultural
    companies make billions of dollars per year, in comparison with subsistence farmers
    growing just enough to feed themselves, or smallholder farmers who grow enough
    to sell on a year-by-year basis. When it comes to data and technology, these differences
    in resources translate to stark power imbalances in data access and use. The most
    well resourced actors are able to delve into new technologies and make the most
    of those insights, whereas others are unable to take any such risks or divert
    any of their limited resources. Access to and use of data has radically changed
    the business models and behaviour of some of those well resourced actors, but
    in contrast, those with fewer resources are receiving the same, limited access
    to information that they always have. In this paper, we have approached these
    issues from a responsible data perspective, drawing upon the experience of the
    Responsible Data community1 who over the past three years have created tools,
    questions and resources to deal with the ethical, legal, privacy and security
    challenges that come from new uses of data in various sectors.

  abstract: Epidemiology has made advances, thanks to the availability of real-time
    surveillance data and by leveraging the geographic analysis of incidents. There
    are many health information systems that visualize the symptoms of influenza-like
    illness on a digital map, which is suitable for end-users, but it does not afford
    further processing and analysis. Existing systems have emphasized the collection,
    analysis, and visualization of surveillance data, but they have neglected a modular
    and interoperable design that integrates high-resolution geo-location with real-time
    data. As a remedy, we have built an open-source project and we have been operating
    an open service that detects flu-related symptoms and shares the data in real-time
    with anyone who wants to built upon this system. An analysis of a small number
    of precisely geo-located status updates (e.g. Twitter) correlates closely with
    the Google Flu Trends and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention flu-positive
    reports. We suggest that public health information systems should embrace an open-source
    approach and offer linked data, in order to facilitate the development of an ecosystem
    of applications and services, and in order to be transparent to the general public
    interest.

    Agricultural data is a vital resource in the effort to address food insecurity. This data is used across the food-production chain. For example, farmers rely on agricultural data to decide when to plant crops, scientists use data to conduct research on pests and design disease resistant plants, and governments make policy based on land use data. As the value of agricultural data is understood, there is a growing call for governments and firms to open their agricultural data.

    Open data is data that anyone can access, use, or share. Open agricultural data has the potential to address food insecurity by making it easier for farmers and other stakeholders to access and use the data they need. Open data also builds trust and fosters collaboration among stakeholders that can lead to new discoveries to address the problems of feeding a growing population.

  abstract: |-
    The public pays for and provides an incredible amount of data to governments and companies. Yet much of the value of this data is being wasted, remaining in silos rather than being shared to enhance the common good—whether it’s helping governments to stop opioid addiction or helping companies predict and meet the demand for electric or autonomous vehicles.

    Many companies and governments are interested in sharing more of their data with each other; however, right now the process of sharing is very time consuming and can pose great risks since it often involves sharing full data sets with another entity.

    We need intermediaries to design safe environments to facilitate data sharing in the low-trust and politically sensitive context of companies and governments. These safe environments would exist outside the government, be transparent to the public, and use modern technologies and techniques to allow only statistical uses of data through temporary linkages in order to minimize the risk to individuals’ privacy.

    as well as private sector businesses not subject to the Common Rule, conduct analysis
    of a wide array of data sources, from massive commercial or government databases
    to individual tweets or Facebook postings publicly available online, with little
    or no opportunity to directly engage human subjects to obtain their consent or

  abstract: When like-minded people discuss with each other, i.e. engage in ‘enclave
    deliberation’, their opinions tend to become more extreme. This is called group
    polarization. A population-based experiment with a pre-test post-test design was
    conducted to analyze whether the norms and procedures of deliberation interfere
    with the mechanisms of group polarization. Based on a survey, people with either
    permissive or restrictive attitudes toward immigration were first identified and
    then invited to the experiment. The participants were randomly assigned to like-minded
    and mixed small-n groups. Each like-minded group consisted of only permissive
    or restrictive participants, whereas each mixed group consisted of four permissive
    and four restrictive participants. The like-minded treatment represents enclave
    deliberation, and the mixed treatment a ‘standard’ deliberative mini-public design.
    The main finding of our experiment is that people with anti-immigrant attitudes
    become more tolerant even when they deliberate in like-minded groups. Moreover,
    similar learning curves are observed in both treatments. Based on the results,
    we conclude that deliberative norms can alleviate the negative consequences of
    discussion in like-minded groups.

  abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing trend of releasing public
    sector information as open data. Governments worldwide see the potential benefits
    of opening up their data. The potential benefits are more transparency, increased
    governmental efficiency and effectiveness, and external benefits, including societal
    and economic benefits. The private sector also recognizes potential benefits of
    making their datasets available as open data. One such company is Liander, an
    energy network administrator in the Netherlands. Liander views open data as a
    contributing factor to energy conservation. However, to date there has been little
    research done into the actual effects of open data. This research has developed
    a monitoring framework to assess the effects of open data, and has applied the
    framework to Liander’s small-scale energy consumption dataset

  abstract: James Madison wrote, 'Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every
    Athenian assembly would still have been a mob'. The contributors to this volume
    discuss and for the most part challenge this claim by considering conditions under
    which many minds can be wiser than one. With backgrounds in economics, cognitive
    science, political science, law and history, the authors consider information
    markets, the internet, jury debates, democratic deliberation and the use of diversity
    as mechanisms for improving collective decisions. At the same time, they consider
    voter irrationality and paradoxes of aggregation as possibly undermining the wisdom
    of groups. Implicitly or explicitly, the volume also offers guidance and warnings
    to institutional designers.

  abstract: |-
    The role and impact of algorithms has attracted considerable interest in the media. Its impact is already being reflected in adjustments made in a number of sectors - entertainment, travel, transport, cities and financial services. From an innovation point of view, algorithms enable new knowledge to be created and identify solutions to problems. The emergency of smart sensing technologies, 3D printing, automated systems and robotics is seamlessly being interwoven into discourses such as ‘the collaborative economy,’ ‘governance by platforms’ and ‘empowerment.’ Innovations such as body worn cameras, fitness trackers 3D printing, smart meters, robotics and Big Data hold out the promise of a new algorithmic future. However, the shift in focus from natural scarce resources towards information also makes individuals the objects and the mediated construction of access and knowledge infrastructures now provide the conditions for harnessing value from data.

    The increasing role of algorithms in environments mediated by technology also coincide with growing interdisciplinary scholarship voicing concerns about the vulnerability of the values we associate with fundamental freedoms and how these are being algorithmically reconfigured or dismantled in a systematic manner. The themed issue, *Justice in Algorithmic Robes*, is intended to initiative a dialogue on both the challenges and opportunities as digitalization ushers in a period of transformation that has no immediate parallels in terms of scale, speed and reach. The articles provide different perspectives to the transformation taking place in the digital environment. The contributors offer an interdisciplinary view of how the digital economy is being invigorated and evaluate the regulatory responses - in particular, how these transformations interact with law. The different spheres covered in *Justice in Algorithmic Robes* - the relations between the State and individuals in the age of Big Data, and health and wearables - not only reveal the problem of defining spheres of economic, political and social activity, but also highlight how these contexts evolve into structures for dominance, power and control. Reimagining the role of law does not mean that technology is the problem but the central idea from the contributions is that how we critically interpret and construct *Justice in Algorithmic Robes* is probably the first step we must take, always mindful of the fact that law may actually reinforce power structures.

    There have been significant shifts in the policy environment of South Africa that are transforming the way citizen engagement takes place in the country. However, high income inequality in South Africa extends to the differentiated experiences of ICT-mediated engagement amongst citizens. ICT response mechanisms are not well defined with respect to sub-populations who may work or live in less formalised and undocumented settings.

    This Brief looks at the case study of the Phephanathi project. implemented in Warwick market, one of the largest inner city 'informal' open air markets in Durban. Informal traders were encouraged to re-imagine their work-place as safe spaces where they enjoy rights to their occupational health. The project used participatory mapping to help establish mechanisms for traders to work with the municipality, via the NGO Asiye eTafuleni, on their health and safety needs. ICTs are used to send messages related to health to traders and to get feedback from traders through geo-tagging of health and safety hazards in the market.

    New study from the Carter Center examines women’s right to information in Bangladesh. The research assessed whether women are able to exercise the right to information with the same facility as men and also identified the main obstacles facing women in accessing information, and types of information most critical to women for economic empowerment and the protection of rights.

    Within the area of access to information for economic empowerment, this research looked at four interconnected themes: education, land, business, and agriculture. Also, it explored women’s need for information on rights more generally. The study methodology called for regional sample diversity. By collecting full data sets within each region, a case study for selected districts and Dhaka was completed to identify variations in women’s access to information, key obstacles, and priority issues.

    has changed significantly over recent years. Officials, civil society and the
    private sector are stepping up efforts to harness existing and new data sources
    to support decision-making and accountability for sustainable development. There
    is, however, a need for stronger evidence on how citizen-generated data initiatives
    contribute to change in the development context. Making All Voices Count commissioned
    Development Initiatives (DI) and Development Research and Training (DRT) to conduct
    a one-year study, presented in this report, on the use of citizen-generated data
    in two different cases in Uganda and Kenya. '

  abstract: |-
    In recent years, a diverse coalition of actors has pushed the creation and diffusion of open data programmes around the world. Governments, international organizations, businesses, academics, media, civil society organizations, and web developers have embraced and sponsored open data programs creating large expectations a suitable remedy for challenges of good governance, economic growth, social inclusion, innovation, and participation.

    Though in many cases this may be true, there is a need for a critical perspective on whether the outcomes indeed occur and under what circumstances. There is a widespread lack of empirical evidence underlying the implementation of Open Data initiative and that can guide better practice and policy formulation, particularly as it spreads to developing countries. Thus, this initial consultation explored substantive and procedural options for the implementation of a research agenda aimed at better understanding the impact of open data.

    This meeting brought together 20 renowned policy-oriented academics coming from diverse geographical areas and backgrounds in order to discuss an interdisciplinary research agenda on the impact of Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives under political, economic and social dimensions. The meeting included a debate on potential research questions and approaches that could inform an international research network on the impact of Open Government Data (OGD) in developing countries.

    The participants also expressed the commitment to the further development of the research agenda and demonstrated their interest in participate in a research network in different forms. They added a number of considerations and contributions for the development of a research network that would address these challenges.

  abstract: Why do some societies manage to control corruption so that it manifests
    itself only occasionally, while other societies remain systemically corrupt? This
    book is about how societies reach that point when integrity becomes the norm and
    corruption the exception in regard to how public affairs are run and public resources
    are allocated. It primarily asks what lessons we have learned from historical
    and contemporary experiences in developing corruption control, which can aid policy-makers
    and civil societies in steering and expediting this process. Few states now remain
    without either an anticorruption agency or an Ombudsman, yet no statistical evidence
    can be found that they actually induce progress. Using both historical and contemporary
    studies and easy to understand statistics, Alina Mungiu-Pippidi looks at how to
    diagnose, measure and change governance so that those entrusted with power and
    authority manage to defend public resources.

  abstract: 'Drawing on a two-year ethnographic study within several French administrations
    involved in open data programs, this article aims to investigate the conditions
    of the release of government data - the rawness of which open data policies require.
    This article describes two sets of phenomena. First, far from being taken for
    granted, open data emerge in administrations through a progressive process that
    entails uncertain collective inquiries and extraction work. Secondly, the opening
    process draws on a series of transformations, as data are modified to satisfy
    an important criterion of open data policies: the need for both human and technical
    intelligibility. These are organizational consequences for those two points, which
    can notably lead to the visibilization or the invisibilization of data labor.
    Finally, the article invites us to reconsider the apparent contradiction between
    the process of data release and the existence of raw data. Echoing the vocabulary
    of one of the interviewees, the multiple operations can be seen as a ''rawification''
    process by which open government data are carefully generated. Such a notion notably
    helps to build a relational model of what counts as data and what counts as work.'

  abstract: 'The role of open data intermediaries in an ecosystem broadly, and in
    the data chain specifically, is highly relevant – they may in fact be vital for
    a data chain to be fluid. There is a small but growing body of empirical-based
    research that analyzes the behaviour of open data intermediaries; empirical evidence
    that specifically focuses on the entrance of open data intermediaries into the
    ecosystem is even scarcer. The present study aims to reduce the scarcity of empirical
    fine-grained evidence concerning open data intermediaries and their emergence,
    in particular, their characteristics that enable them to enter into an ecosystem
    and to thrive in it. The analysis of the behavior of the two intermediaries located
    at the interface of open data in the agricultural and mobile-phone sectors in
    Ghana leads to the following conclusions: the emergence of intermediaries is primarily
    conditioned by the previous presence of a (broad) niche area, that is, in for
    order intermediaries to appear, there must be new spaces available in the ecosystem
    for them to occupy; a niche may be sufficiently broad to accommodate not a single
    specific intermediary but rather a range of similar yet distinct intermediaries
    that can populate different zones within the niche; each intermediary deploys
    the forms of the capital differently to connect to users successfully; given the
    extent of capitals which it possesses, each intermediary identifies a different
    area of the ecosystem where this capital would assure the highest return; a deficiency
    of certain forms of capital can also be appeased by linking to other intermediaries;
    the emergence and subsequent survival of the intermediaries importantly modifies
    the ecosystem which they have entered and populated; and open data intermediaries
    enhance flow of data in an ecosystem by sourcing, creating, mixing and curating
    data from multiple sources, both open and closed.'

    - Many initiatives exist simply as an app, or web page, driven by what the technology can do, rather than by what the need is.
    - Lessons from global case studies describe how digital tools are being used to engage communities in more meaningful political participation, and how they are improving the quality and legitimacy of decision-making.
    - Digital democracy is still young. Projects must embed better methods for evaluation of their goals if the field is to grow.

  abstract: 'There are several challenges with which data present us nowadays. For
    one there is the abundance of data and the necessity to extract the essential
    information from it. When tackling this task a balance has to be struck between
    putting aside irrelevant information and keeping the relevant one without getting
    lost in detail, known as over-fitting. The law of parsimony, also known as Occam’s
    razor should be a guiding principle, keeping models simple while explaining the
    data. The next challenge is the fact that the data samples are not static. New
    samples arrive constantly through the pipeline. Therefore, there is a need for
    models which update themselves as the new sample becomes available. The models
    should be flexible enough to become more complex should this be necessary. In
    addition the models should inform us which samples need to be collected so that
    the collection process becomes most informative. Another challenge are the conclusions
    we draw from the data. After all, as popularized by Mark Twain: "There are three
    kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics." An objective measure of confidence
    is needed to make generalized statements The last challenge is the analysis. Can
    we build systems which inform us of the underlying structure and processes which
    gave rise to the data? Moreover, it is not enough to discover the structure and
    processes, we also need to add meaning to it. Here different disciplines need
    to work together. '

  abstract: Citizen science initiatives encourage volunteer participants to collect
    and interpret data and contribute to formal scientific projects. The growth of
    virtual citizen science (VCS), facilitated through websites and mobile applications
    since the mid-2000s, has been driven by a combination of software innovations
    and mobile technologies, growing scientific data flows without commensurate increases
    in resources to handle them, and the desire of internet-connected participants
    to contribute to collective outputs. However, the increasing availability of internet-based
    activities requires individual VCS projects to compete for the attention of volunteers
    and promote their long-term retention. We examined program and platform design
    principles that might allow VCS initiatives to compete more effectively for volunteers,
    increase productivity of project participants, and retain contributors over time.
    We surveyed key personnel engaged in managing a sample of VCS projects to identify
    the principles and practices they pursued for these purposes and led a team in
    a heuristic evaluation of volunteer engagement, website or application usability,
    and participant retention. We received 40 completed survey responses (33% response
    rate) and completed a heuristic evaluation of 20 VCS program sites. The majority
    of the VCS programs focused on scientific outcomes, whereas the educational and
    social benefits of program participation, variables that are consistently ranked
    as important for volunteer engagement and retention, were incidental. Evaluators
    indicated usability, across most of the VCS program sites, was higher and less
    variable than the ratings for participant engagement and retention. In the context
    of growing competition for the attention of internet volunteers, increased attention
    to the motivations of virtual citizen scientists may help VCS programs sustain
    the necessary engagement and retention of their volunteers.

  abstract: This paper reviews the use of behavioural ideas to improve public policy.
    There needs to be a behavioural take on decision-making itself so that policies
    are designed in more effective ways. it recounts the beginnings of behavioural
    sciences as currently conceived and then setting out the massive expansion of
    interest that has come about since that time. It reports on how such ideas have
    had a large impact on governments at all levels across the world, but also noting
    how decision-making itself has been influenced by more policy-relevant ideas.
    The paper discusses the paradox that the very decision-makers themselves are subject
    to the same biases as the objects of behavioural economics, which might imply
    limitations in the choices of such interventions. Here the text of the chapter
    reengages with the classics of decision-making theory. The chapter notes how behavioural
    sciences need not depend on a top down approach but can incorporate citizen voice.
    The paper reviews how citizens and other groups can use behavioural cues to alter
    the behaviour of policy-makers in socially beneficial ways. The paper discusses
    how behaviourally informed measures could be integrated within the policy making
    process in ways that advance the effective use of evidence and nudge decision
    to make better policies.

  abstract: In his bestselling Here Comes Everybody, Internet guru Clay Shirky provided
    readers with a much-needed primer for the digital age. Now, with Cognitive Surplus,
    he reveals how new digital technology is unleashing a torrent of creative production
    that will transform our world. For the first time, people are embracing new media
    that allow them to pool their efforts at vanishingly low cost. The results of
    this aggregated effort range from mind-expanding reference tools like Wikipedia
    to life-saving Web sites like Ushahidi.com, which allows Kenyans to report acts
    of violence in real time. Cognitive Surplus explores what's possible when people
    unite to use their intellect, energy, and time for the greater good.

  abstract: This work presents Knowlex, a web application designed for visualization,
    exploration, and analysis of legal documents coming from different sources. Understanding
    the legal framework relating to a given issue often requires the analysis of complex
    legal corpora. When a legal professional or a citizen tries to understand how
    a given phenomenon is disciplined, his attention cannot be limited to a single
    source of law but has to be directed on the bigger picture resulting from all
    the legal sources related to the theme under investigation. Knowlex exploits data
    visualization to support this activity by means of interactive maps making sense
    out of heterogeneous documents (norms, case law, legal literature, etc.). Starting
    from a legislative measure (what we define as Root) given as input by the user,
    the application implements two visual analytics functionalities aiming to offer
    new insights on the legal corpus under investigation. The first one is an interactive
    node graph depicting relations and properties of the documents. The second one
    is a zoomable treemap showing the topics, the evolution, and the dimension of
    the legal literature settled over the years around the norm of interest.  The
    article gives an overview of the research so far conducted presenting the results
    of a preliminary evaluation study aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of visualization
    in supporting legal activities as well as the effectiveness of Knowlex, the usability
    of the proposed system, and the overall user satisfaction when interacting with
    its applications.

    As a pioneer in the field of social advocacy combined with technology, BudgIT, a social advocacy organisation in Nigeria, aims to simplify the topic of public spending for citizens with the aim of increasing transparency and accountability in government. Through its platform, Tracka, BudgIT works to ensure the completion of projects. Through citizen groups, it also tests the links between fiscal transparency, citizens’ and institutional engagement with the legislature to demand accountability, and the responsiveness of public offices in service delivery.

    This practice paper reports on practitioner research conducted by BudgIT, and documents a reflective conversation on the implications of its findings for future efforts to improve accountability in Nigeria.. It aims to discover if access to information leads to empowerment, as well as demands for accountability; and whether demands for accountability necessarily lead to the greater responsiveness of public institutions. BudgIT designed a research project that focused on two groups of citizens: those with access to digital information in urban areas or ‘digital citizens’; and those without access to digital tools – usually rural-based with relatively low levels of education – or ‘non-digital citizens’. This was based on the belief that every citizen – irrespective of their literacy level – has a right to know how public funds are spent.

  abstract: Presenting rigorous and original research, this volume offers key insights
    into the historical, cultural, social, economic and political forces at play in
    the creation of world-class ICT innovations in Kenya. Following the arrival of
    fiber-optic cables in 2009, Digital Kenya examines why the initial entrepreneurial
    spirit and digital revolution has begun to falter despite support from motivated
    entrepreneurs, international investors, policy experts and others. Written by
    engaged scholars and professionals in the field, the book offers 15 eye-opening
    chapters and 14 one-on-one conversations with entrepreneurs and investors to ask
    why establishing ICT start-ups on a continental and global scale remains a challenge
    on the “Silicon Savannah”. The authors present evidence-based recommendations
    to help Kenya to continue producing globally impactful ICT innovations that improve
    the lives of those still waiting on the side-lines, and to inspire other nations
    to do the same.

  abstract: Open government has become an important topic in democratically developed
    societies. Its key aims are to increase transparency, citizen trust and public
    participation. Against this background, the article focuses on perceived barriers
    opposing the introduction of open government data. On the basis of cognitive theory
    and a literature review, the essential factors that impede public servants in
    implementing open government data are conceptualized and summarized in a model.
    The perceived risk-based attitude of public servants is identified as the main
    barrier. Other significant obstacles include perceived legal barriers, perceived
    hierarchical structuring of authorities, perceived bureaucratic decision-making
    culture and perceived organizational transparency.

  abstract: |-
    The economic and social potential of open data is widely acknowledged. In particular, the business opportunities have received much attention. But for all the excitement, we still know very little about how and under what conditions open data really works.

    To broaden our understanding of the use and impact of open data, the GovLab has a variety of initiatives and studies underway. Today, we share publicly our findings on how Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are leveraging open data for a variety of purposes. Our paper “Open Data: A 21st Century Asset for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises” seeks to build a portrait of the lifecycle of open data—how it is collected, stored and used. It outlines some of the most important parameters of an open data business model for SMEs.

    The universe of SMEs we analyzed comprised those identified within the GovLab’s Open Data 500 project which contains data on how 500 US businesses are using open data in their day-to-day activities. It represents arguably the first systematic effort to really understand how open data can grow revenues, drive innovation, increase efficiency and create new jobs.

    The paper analyzes ten aspects of open data and establishes ten principles for its effective use by SMEs. Taken together, these offer a roadmap for any SME considering greater use or adoption of open data in its business.

    Among the key findings included in the paper:

    SMEs, which often lack access to data or sophisticated analytical tools to process large datasets, are likely to be one of the chief beneficiaries of open data.
    Government data is the main category of open data being used by SMEs. A number of SMEs are also using open scientific and shared corporate data.
    Open data is used primarily to serve the Business-to-Business (B2B) markets, followed by the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) markets. A number of the companies studied serve two or three market segments simultaneously.
    Open data is usually a free resource, but SMEs are monetizing their open-data-driven services to build viable businesses. The most common revenue models include subscription-based services, advertising, fees for products and services, freemium models, licensing fees, lead generation and philanthropic grants.
    The most significant challenges SMEs face in using open data include those concerning data quality and consistency, insufficient financial and human resources, and issues surrounding privacy.
    This is just a sampling of findings and observations. The paper includes a number of additional observations concerning business and revenue models, product development, customer acquisition, and other subjects of relevance to any company considering an open data strategy.

    The paper was funded by the Markle Foundation and written to inform Markle’s Rework America Initiative.

  abstract: The Open e-Governance Index (OeGI) is a framework for measuring open e-governance,
    developed and tested in four Asian countries in 2012. This report discusses the
    second phase of OeGI project, which examined whether the framework was applicable
    to countries outside Asia. It describes the concept and methodology of the OeGI
    and provides an overview of its use in Colombia, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines
    and Uganda. Open e-governance is about how state and non-state actors use information
    and communications technologies (ICTs) to steer society collectively.

  abstract: In an effort to contribute to a more critical understanding of the role
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in humanitarian action, this
    article explores the topography of the ‘humanitarian cyberspace’ – a composite
    of ‘cyberspace’ and ‘humanitarian space’ – as it has emerged since the mid-1990s.
    The goals are to offer some observations about the conditions of the humanitarian
    cyberspace and to reflect on the relationship between the persistent features
    of humanitarian action and new developments brought on by ICT. The prism through
    which the role of ICT in humanitarian action is explored is that of the ‘shrinking
    humanitarian space’.

  abstract: Much is known about governmental resistance to disclosure laws, less so
    about multi-stakeholder resistance to open data. This study compares open data
    initiatives within the primary and secondary school systems of Brazil and the
    UK, focusing on stakeholder resistance and corresponding policy solutions. The
    analytical framework is based on the ‘Three-Ps’ of open data resistance to performance
    metrics, corresponding to professional, political, and privacy-related concerns.
    Evidence shows that resistance is highly nuanced, as stakeholders alternately
    serve as both principals and agents. School administrators, for example, are simultaneously
    principals to service providers and teachers, and at once agents to parents and
    politicians. Relying on a different systems comparison, in-depth interviews, and
    newspaper content analyses, we find that similar stakeholders across countries
    demonstrate strikingly divergent levels of resistance. In overcoming stakeholder
    resistance – across socioeconomic divides – context conscientious ‘data-informed’
    evaluations may promote greater acceptance than narrowly ‘data-driven’ performance
    measurements.

  abstract: |-
    Background: Despite visits to multiple physicians, many patients remain undiagnosed. A new online program, CrowdMed, aims to leverage the “wisdom of the crowd” by giving patients an opportunity to submit their cases and interact with case solvers to obtain diagnostic possibilities.

    Objective: To describe CrowdMed and provide an independent assessment of its impact.

    Methods: Patients submit their cases online to CrowdMed and case solvers sign up to help diagnose patients. Case solvers attempt to solve patients’ diagnostic dilemmas and often have an interactive online discussion with patients, including an exchange of additional diagnostic details. At the end, patients receive detailed reports containing diagnostic suggestions to discuss with their physicians and fill out surveys about their outcomes. We independently analyzed data collected from cases between May 2013 and April 2015 to determine patient and case solver characteristics and case outcomes.

    Results: During the study period, 397 cases were completed. These patients previously visited a median of 5 physicians, incurred a median of US $10,000 in medical expenses, spent a median of 50 hours researching their illnesses online, and had symptoms for a median of 2.6 years. During this period, 357 active case solvers participated, of which 37.9% (132/348) were male and 58.3% (208/357) worked or studied in the medical industry. About half (50.9%, 202/397) of patients were likely to recommend CrowdMed to a friend, 59.6% (233/391) reported that the process gave insights that led them closer to the correct diagnoses, 57% (52/92) reported estimated decreases in medical expenses, and 38% (29/77) reported estimated improvement in school or work productivity.

    Conclusions: Some patients with undiagnosed illnesses reported receiving helpful guidance from crowdsourcing their diagnoses during their difficult diagnostic journeys. However, further development and use of crowdsourcing methods to facilitate diagnosis requires long-term evaluation as well as validation to account for patients’ ultimate correct diagnoses.

  abstract: Today, social media have attracted the attention of political actors and
    administrative institutions to inform citizens as a prerequisite of open and transparent
    administration, deliver public services, contact stakeholders, revitalize democracy,
    encourage the cross-agency cooperation, and contribute to knowledge management.
    In this context, the social media tools can contribute to the emergence of citizen-oriented,
    open, transparent and participatory public administration. Taking advantage of
    the opportunities offered by social media is not limited to central government.
    Local governments deploy internet-based innovative technologies that complement
    traditional methods in implementing different functions. This book focuses on
    the relationship between the local governments and social media, deals with the
    change that social media have caused in the organization, understanding of service
    provision, performance of local governments and in the relationships between local
    governments and their partners, and aims to advance our theoretical and empirical
    understanding of the growing use of social media by local governments. This book
    will be of interest to researchers and students in e-government, public administration,
    political science, communication, information science, and social media. Government
    officials and public managers will also find practical use recommendations for
    social media in several aspects of local governance

  abstract: Uganda has democratic deficits where demand for democracy exceeds its
    supply. As a consequence it is argued that a segment of Ugandans might participate
    and honour the freedom to speak out, assemble, and associate given new opportunities
    outside the traditional political channels. With expanded mobile coverage and
    access to mobile devices and services in mind, and using the concept of open crowdsourcing,
    the platform UgandaWatch was launched prior to the 2011 general elections with
    the intention to meet the demand, to offer increased equality of political participation,
    and to advance efforts toward increased citizen engagement in Uganda. From a community
    informatics point of view, the study examined how and under what conditions access
    to ICT tools (mobile devices, networks, and a crowdsourcing platform) can be made
    usable and useful for people and communities for increased political participation
    in a given context. By combining the collection and analysis of quantitative (SMS-survey)
    and qualitative data (focus groups) through a mixed-method approach, this study
    answers the questions, What are the key factors that influence users’ willingness
    to use mobile phones and crowdsourcing platforms as a channel for political participation?,
    and What concerns do users have with respect to using mobile phones and crowdsourcing
    platforms in the participation process? The study shows that users participated
    because they hoped it would bring real change to Uganda’s electoral and political
    landscape, that it was a convenient channel to use (quick and easy) and that confidentiality
    was assured. The user concerns relate to costs, trust, and safety. Crowdsourcing
    offers an alternative channel and may substitute or supplement traditional means
    of political participation. It can increase participation in some groups, including
    among those who normally do not participate—something that increases equality
    of political participation in a positive direction.

  abstract: The basic assumption of the open data movement is that more intensive
    and creative use of information and technology can improve policymaking and generate
    new forms of public value. These efforts can focus on education, public health,
    transportation, environmental stewardship, economic development and many other
    areas. Each application has its own substantive considerations, forms of expertise,
    and interests. Ironically, information is often treated as a black box in the
    open data movement. Stakeholders, analytical techniques, and technology tools
    all receive considerable attention. But information is often seen as a given,
    used uncritically, and trusted without examination. However, he very kind of data
    that is now being released from administrative systems as “open data” was collected
    or created for other purposes. It has undeniable potential value, but it also
    substantial risks for validity, relevance, and trust.

  abstract: |-
    This report examines patient organisations’ ever more critical role as knowledge brokers in an increasingly complex, data-rich healthcare system.
    Key findings

    Patient organisations are important examples of collective intelligence practiced in challenging conditions with the aim of tackling complex problems.
    With more long term conditions and multimorbidities, more data, more available options in diagnostics, treatments, and care, knowledge is becoming one of the most critical assets of patients seeking optimal care.
    Patient organisations, working as collectives, are in an excellent position to support the work of translating, assembling and analysing the information involved in healthcare.
    Innovative patient organisations are already supporting the development of peer relationships, driving ambitious research programmes, sharing skills and unlocking the energy and expertise of patients. But they need support from better tools to extend this critical work.
    Unlike many popular examples of collective intelligence such as open source software, people coming to patient organisations are not motivated by pre-existing technical skills, but by urgent personal needs. This makes them a hugely productive site of research.

    The ‘thinking challenges’ patients face are enormous and complex, involving an ever-growing store of medical information, the practical and bureaucratic skills of living with a condition. Many go beyond adherence to understanding and partaking in research.

    The health care system is under strain from increasing demand and resource pressure. The NHS and other healthcare networks have committed to engage and empower patients and support them in developing expertise, enabling them to take a more active role in their own care. But knowledge tools and systems that engage only with individuals tend to exacerbate existing health care divides. Health knowledge work is hard, and requires time and resources.

    In this report we argue that patient organisations have a pivotal role to play in distributing the burden and benefit of knowledge work amongst participants. They need new and better tools to support their work developing connections between the many individuals and institutions of the healthcare system, driving ambitious research programmes, and facilitating peer support.

  abstract: "Geospatial big data present a new set of challenges and opportunities
    for cartographic researchers in technical, methodological and artistic realms.
    New computational and technical paradigms for cartography are accompanying the
    rise of geospatial big data. Additionally, the art and science of cartography
    needs to focus its contemporary efforts on work that connects to outside disciplines
    and is grounded in problems that are important to humankind and its sustainability.
    Following the development of position papers and a collaborative workshop to craft
    consensus around key topics, this article presents a new cartographic research
    agenda focused on making maps that matter using geospatial big data. This agenda
    provides both long-term challenges that require significant attention and short-term
    opportunities that we believe could be addressed in more concentrated studies.\n\n"

  abstract: Linked Open Data (LOD) is reaching significant adoption in Public Administrations
    (PAs), where it is often required to be connected to existing platforms, such
    as GIS-based data management. Bearing on previous experience with the pioneering
    data.cnr.it, through Semantic Scout, as well as Italian DigitPA agency recommendations
    for LOD in Italian PA, we are working on the extraction, publication, and exploitation
    of data from the Geographic Information System of the Municipality of Catania,
    referred to as SIT ("Sistema Informativo Territoriale"). This paper describes
    the results and lessons learnt from the first campaign, aiming at analysing, reengineering,
    linking, and formalizing the Shape-based geo-data from the SIT.

  abstract: |-
    There is, this Brief argues, a new governance paradigm emerging, characterised by the rise of "governance by networks" and "rule by data". This flux, say the authors, is marked by a hollowing out of the state, replacement of human functions in public administration by digital technologies, and networks where private actors are becoming part of government.

    The resultant crisis of governability calls for new institutional mechanisms to protect and promote democratic values, as old ones are rendered inadequate. For actors concerned with questions of rights and social justice, two imperatives arise:
    - the need to articulate and call for institutional norms, rules and practices that guarantee democratic accountability in this emerging context
    - the need to claim the civic-public value of digital technologies so that data and the new possibilities for networking are harnessed towards a robust and vibrant grassroots democracy and citizen empowerment.

    This document examines and discusses shifts in the contemporary democratic fabric by focusing on emerging technological practices in government. It explores key concerns, and articulates the gaps in current legal-policy measures necessary to promote participatory democracy in the digital age.

    A new generation of strategies for government accountability is needed, one that fully considers entrenched, institutional obstacles to change. Vertical integration of coordinated civil society policy monitoring and advocacy is one such strategy. Engaging each stage and level of public sector actions in an integrated way can locate the causes of accountability failures, show their interconnected nature, and leverage the local, national and transnational power shifts necessary to produce sustainable institutional change.

    This case study summary is one of seven that reflect on civil society monitoring and advocacy initiatives in the Philippines – all of which aim to improve government accountability in different sectors – through the lens of vertical integration.

    In 2012, the Philippines finally enacted the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act, widely known as the RH law. This guarantees universal access to methods of family planning, age-appropriate reproductive health and sexual education, and maternal and reproductive health services.

    This case study focuses on the story of Likhaan Centre for Women’s Health, part of the Reproductive Health Alliance Network (RHAN). It shares experiences and lessons from the successful campaign, looking at the initiatives and actions that took place at different levels of policy-making.

  abstract: This book focuses on the implementation of digital strategies in the public
    sectors in the US, Mexico, Brazil, India and Germany. The case studies presented
    examine different digital projects by looking at their impact as well as their
    alignment with their national governments’ digital strategies. The contributors
    assess the current state of digital government, analyze the contribution of digital
    technologies in achieving outcomes for citizens, discuss ways to measure digitalization
    and address the question of how governments oversee the legal and regulatory obligations
    of information technology. The book argues that most countries formulate good
    strategies for digital government, but do not effectively prescribe and implement
    corresponding policies and programs. Showing specific programs that deliver results

  abstract: Challenges are woven deeply through the complex tapestry that is modern
    policymaking. Governments are tasked with addressing difficulties ranging from
    geopolitical instability to fluctuating global growth, food security to climate
    change, all of which are easy to list but far more difficult to solve. At the
    same time, our world is undergoing rapid transformation. Nanotechnology, artificial
    intelligence, 3D printing and gene sequencing are just some of the many technologies
    helping make the impossible possible. Today, disruption is no longer a concept
    but a reality. Governments are striving in many areas to keep up. We see examples
    of policymakers deploying new techniques such as behavioural insights and “Labs”
    – bespoke teams dedicated to creating new and better solutions – are becoming
    increasingly prevalent. Governments’ use of digital technology is also on the
    up – the days of having to stand in line to renew your passport or driving licence
    are now long gone in many countries. And yet the OECD’s finding that trust in
    national governments across its countries was just 41.8% in 2014 compared with
    45.2% in 2007 tells a story of hopes unfulfilled and expectations dashed. It also
    gives rise to fears that populations will become unwilling to support public institutions
    through taxation or to participate in the democratic process. Clearly, governments
    need to do much more to demonstrate their impact and how citizens benefit. To
    help governments navigate their way from idea to impact, the Centre for Public
    Impact (CPI) has developed a framework for thinking about the elements that influence
    the success of government initiatives. The Public Impact Fundamentals will help
    governments improve their performance and achieve better results for citizens

    In Canada, the open data environment should be viewed as a supply chain. The movement of open data from producers to consumers involves many different organizations, people, activities, projects and initiatives, all of which work together to push out a final product. Naturally, if there is a break or hurdle in this supply chain, it doesn't work efficiently. A fundamental hurdle highlighted by companies across the country was the inability to scale their business at the provincial, national and international levels.

    This blueprint aims to address the challenges Canadian entrepreneurs are facing by encouraging municipalities to launch open data initiatives. By sharing best practices, we hope to encourage the accessibility of datasets within existing jurisdictions. The structured recommendations in this Open Data Blueprint are based on feedback and best practices seen in major cities across Canada collected through ODX's primary research.

  abstract: |-
    Poor provision of information and communication technologies in low/middle-income
     countries represents a concern for promoting Open Data. This is often framed as a “digital
     divide” and addressed through initiatives that increase the availability of information and
     communication technologies to researchers based in low-resourced environments, as well as
     the amount of resources freely accessible online, including data themselves. Using empirical
     data from a qualitative study of lab-based research in Africa we highlight the limitations of
     such framing and emphasize the range of additional factors necessary to effectively utilize
     data available online. We adopt the ‘Capabilities Approach’ proposed by Sen to highlight the
     distinction between simply making resources available, and doing so while fostering
     researchers’ ability to use them. This provides an alternative orientation that highlights the
     persistence of deep inequalities within the seemingly egalitarian-inspired Open Data
     landscape. The extent and manner of future data sharing, we propose, will hinge on the
     ability to respond to the heterogeneity of research environments

  abstract: "Since the beginning of human history, people have made decisions in groups—first
    in families and villages, and now as part of companies, governments, school boards,
    religious organizations, or any one of countless other groups. And having more
    than one person to help decide is good because the group benefits from the collective
    knowledge of all of its members, and this results in better decisions. Right?\n\nBack
    to reality. We’ve all been involved in group decisions—and they’re hard. And they
    often turn out badly. Why? Many blame bad decisions on “groupthink” without a
    clear idea of what that term really means. \n\nNow, Nudge coauthor Cass Sunstein
    and leading decision-making scholar Reid Hastie shed light on the specifics of
    why and how group decisions go wrong—and offer tactics and lessons to help leaders
    avoid the pitfalls and reach better outcomes. In the first part of the book, they
    explain in clear and fascinating detail the distinct problems groups run into:\n\n•They
    often amplify, rather than correct, individual errors in judgment\n•They fall
    victim to cascade effects, as members follow what others say or do\n•They become
    polarized, adopting more extreme positions than the ones they began with\n•They
    emphasize what everybody knows instead of focusing on critical information that
    only a few people know\n\nIn the second part of the book, the authors turn to
    straightforward methods and advice for making groups smarter. These approaches
    include silencing the leader so that the views of other group members can surface,
    rethinking rewards and incentives to encourage people to reveal their own knowledge,
    thoughtfully assigning roles that are aligned with people’s unique strengths,
    and more.\n\nWith examples from a broad range of organizations—from Google to
    the CIA—and written in an engaging and witty style, Wiser will not only enlighten
    you; it will help your team and your organization make better decisions—decisions
    that lead to greater success."

    Purpose
    – The purpose of this paper is to provide greater insights into the-state-of-the-art in crisis management and aid in better response to health-related crises, with a specific focus on the hotel industry. This study extends the tourism crisis management model to include social media, concerning the role of monitoring and responding.

    Design/methodology/approach
    – This study enhances the classic 4R (readiness, reduction, response and recovery) crisis management model to include social media for hotels facing a bed bug crisis and/or other health-related crises.

    Findings
    – This paper discusses the use of social media at different phases of managing a bed bug crisis, which include risk reduction, readiness, response and recovery. Recommendations are also provided for hotel managers to combat health-related crises that are fought out on social media.

    Practical implications
    – Social media has helped to bridge the communication gap between customers and hotels. Bed bug infestations are a growing health crisis, and they have obtained increasing attention on social media sites. Without managing this crisis effectively, bed bug infestation can cause economic loss and reputational damages to hotel properties, ranging from negative comments and complaints, to possible lawsuits. Thus, it is essential for hoteliers to understand the importance of social media in crisis communication, and to incorporate social media in hotels’ crisis management plans.

  abstract: |-
    In myriad sectors of the U.S. economy, from military technology to medical care, the federal government serves as the single-largest spender. As such, many of the innovations, inventions and discoveries that could propel economic growth in the future also would have a direct and measurable impact on federal spending.

    To offer an incentive to research and development that yields significant taxpayer savings, we propose an “innovation savings program” that would serve as an alternative to the traditional patent system. The program would reward teams or individuals who develop discoveries or technologies that produce federal budget savings. In effect, a portion of those savings would be set aside for the discoverers. To be eligible for these rewards, the researchers and inventors would not receive patents on their discoveries or processes.

    This perpetual, self-funded federal prize system would be based, in part, on the successful False Claims Act and Medicare Recovery Audit programs. Payouts would be administered by an independent or executive agency, verified by the Government Accountability Office and overseen by Congress to ensure fair and effective implementation.

    New technologies developed through this process would be available immediately for generic commercialization, free of royalty fees. This could encourage innovation in sectors where patents and traditional research spending have lagged, while also bringing those innovations to market more quickly and affordably. Prize systems of this type have been in operation in the United States for more than 150 years, in the form of the False Claims Act, and date back to “qui tam” actions from the 13th century, thus predating the patent system by several hundred years.

  abstract: New models of innovation are emerging in the marketplace and these are
    rapidly replacing traditional corporate research labs as the sole source of new
    ideas, new technologies, and new practices. This trend is being fueled by the
    ready availability of venture capital, and more importantly, by the ubiquitous
    presence of information technologies (IT) that are enabling firms to identify
    and foster new ideas from a myriad of knowledge sources, which could be geographically
    dispersed. This de-centralized and un-directed form of innovation, referred to
    as “open innovation”, is gaining traction both in the private and public sectors.
    In this guest editorial for the Special Issue on Open Innovation in the Public
    Sector, we first explore the diverse issues that are engendered when implementing
    open innovation in the public sector, and the IT that can facilitate such initiatives.
    Next, we highlight the fundamental differences in terms of focus, aim, value,
    and external stakeholders of open innovation in the private vs. public sectors.
    Last, we describe an agenda for research on open innovation in the public sector
    based on trends and gaps in the literature as seen from papers that were submitted
    to this special issue. Specifically, we suggest several useful directions for
    future research including conducting domain-specific studies, examining the use
    of tools beyond social media, and expanding the existing set of research methods
    and theoretical foundations.

  abstract: In 2012, New York City Council passed legislation to make government data
    open and freely available to the public. By approving this legislation, City Council
    was attempting to make local government more transparent, accountable, and streamlined
    in its operations. It was also attempting to create economic opportunities and
    to encourage the public to identify ways in which to improve government and local
    communities. The purpose of this study is to explore public uses of New York City
    open data. Currently, more than 1300 datasets covering broad areas such as health,
    education, transportation, public safety, housing and business are available on
    the City’s Open Data Portal. This study found a plethora of maps, visualizations,
    tools, apps and analyses made by the public using New York City open data. Indeed,
    open data is inspiring a productive range of creative reuses yet questions remain
    concerning how useable the data is for users without technical skills and resources.

  abstract: Data-driven innovations have the power to address some of the most pressing
    social challenges in Europe. While many government and non-governmental organizations
    (NGOs) are using data in their attempts to tackle a range of social issues from
    high unemployment to the refugee crisis, more can be done. To accelerate progress,
    public and private-sector leaders should take steps to collect data on disadvantaged
    populations, facilitate cross-sector collaboration on data projects for social
    good, and implement policies that encourage data use, reuse, and sharing in support
    of social goals.

  abstract: 'Although citizen engagement is a core public service value, few public
    administrators receive training on how to share leadership with people outside
    the government. Participatory Budgeting in the United States serves as a primer
    for those looking to understand a classic example of participatory governance,
    engaging local citizens in examining budgetary constraints and priorities before
    making recommendations to local government. Utilizing case studies and an original
    set of interviews with community members, elected officials, and city employees,
    this book provides a rare window onto the participatory budgeting process through
    the words and experiences of the very individuals involved. The central themes
    that emerge from these fascinating and detailed cases focus on three core areas:
    creating the participatory budgeting infrastructure; increasing citizen participation
    in participatory budgeting; and assessing and increasing the impact of participatory
    budgeting. This book provides students, local government elected officials, practitioners,
    and citizens with a comprehensive understanding of participatory budgeting and
    straightforward guidelines to enhance the process of civic engagement and democratic
    values in local communities.'

  abstract: This paper aims at connecting democratic theory with civic technologies
    in order to highlight the links between some theoretical tensions and tri-lemmas
    and design trade-offs. First, it reviews some tensions and ‘trilemmas’ raised
    by political philosophers and democratic theorists. Second, it considers both
    the role and the limitations of civic technologies in mitigating these ten-sions
    and trilemmas. Third, it proposes to adopt a meso-level approach, in be-tween
    the macro-level of democratic theories and the micro-level of tools, to situate
    the interplay between people, digital technologies, and data.

  abstract: 'In this paper we give a basic introduction to the transition in contemporary
    surveillance from top down traditional police surveillance to profiling and “pre-crime”
    methods. We then review in more detail the rise of open source (OSINT) and social
    media (SOCMINT) intelligence and its use by law enforcement and security authorities.
    Following this we consider what if any privacy protection is currently given in
    UK law to SOCMINT. Given the largely negative response to the above question,
    we analyse what reasonable expectations of privacy there may be for users of public
    social media, with reference to existing case law on art 8 of the ECHR. Two factors
    are in particular argued to be supportive of a reasonable expectation of privacy
    in open public social media communications: first, the failure of many social
    network users to perceive the environment where they communicate as “public”;
    and secondly, the impact of search engines (and other automated analytics) on
    traditional conceptions of structured dossiers as most problematic for state surveillance.
    Lastly, we conclude that existing law does not provide adequate protection for
    open SOCMINT and that this will be increasingly significant as more and more personal
    data is disclosed and collected in public without well-defined expectations of
    privacy.'

  abstract: |-
    A new field of collective intelligence has emerged in the last few years, prompted by a wave of digital technologies that make it possible for organizations and societies to think at large scale. This “bigger mind”—human and machine capabilities working together—has the potential to solve the great challenges of our time. So why do smart technologies not automatically lead to smart results? Gathering insights from diverse fields, including philosophy, computer science, and biology, Big Mind reveals how collective intelligence can guide corporations, governments, universities, and societies to make the most of human brains and digital technologies.

    Geoff Mulgan explores how collective intelligence has to be consciously organized and orchestrated in order to harness its powers. He looks at recent experiments mobilizing millions of people to solve problems, and at groundbreaking technology like Google Maps and Dove satellites. He also considers why organizations full of smart people and machines can make foolish mistakes—from investment banks losing billions to intelligence agencies misjudging geopolitical events—and shows how to avoid them.

    Highlighting differences between environments that stimulate intelligence and those that blunt it, Mulgan shows how human and machine intelligence could solve challenges in business, climate change, democracy, and public health. But for that to happen we’ll need radically new professions, institutions, and ways of thinking.

    Informed by the latest work on data, web platforms, and artificial intelligence, Big Mind shows how collective intelligence could help us survive and thrive.

  abstract: 'Explaining individual behavior in politics should rely on the same motivational
    assumptions as explaining behavior in the market: That’s what Political Economy,
    understood as the application of economics to the study of political processes,
    is all about. In its standard variant, those who played the game of politics should
    also be considered rational and self-interested, unlike the benevolent despot
    of earlier models. History repeats itself with the rise of behavioral economics:
    Assuming cognitive biases to be present in the market, but not in politics, behavioral
    economists often call for government to intervene in a “benevolent” way. Recently,
    however, political economists have started to apply behavioral economics insights
    to the study of political processes, thereby re-establishing a unified methodology.
    This paper surveys the current state of the emerging field of “Behavioral Political
    Economy” and considers the scope for further research.'

  abstract: This article examines the changing nature of the connection between citizens,
    party members and elites in the creation of party policy through the theoretical
    prism of individualisation. Using qualitative case studies of recent policy-making
    initiatives in the Australian Labor Party and the UK Labour Party, the article
    develops a new model of policy transferal that is not built upon the mass-party
    model of parliamentary politics, but rather upon organisational evolutions such
    as community consultations, online participation and supporters' networks. These
    evolutions, or reforms, typically emphasise the individuality of policy-making
    and accountability, promote new technologies for facilitating decision-making,
    and attempt to engage with a new style of politically active citizen. Each of
    these developments carries implications for how political parties facilitate participation,
    accountability and responsiveness in modern forms of representative democracy.

  abstract: In the spirit of Jeremy Bentham's Political Tactics, this volume offers
    the first comprehensive discussion of the effects of secrecy and publicity on
    debates and votes in committees and assemblies. The contributors – sociologists,
    political scientists, historians, and legal scholars – consider the micro-technology
    of voting (the devil is in the detail), the historical relations between the secret
    ballot and universal suffrage, the use and abolition of secret voting in parliamentary
    decisions, and the sometimes perverse effects of the drive for greater openness
    and transparency in public affairs. The authors also discuss the normative questions
    of secret versus public voting in national elections and of optimal mixes of secrecy
    and publicity, as well as the opportunities for strategic behavior created by
    different voting systems. Together with two previous volumes on Collective Wisdom
    (Cambrige, 2012) and Majority Decisions (Cambridge, 2014), the book sets a new
    standard for interdisciplinary work on collective decision-making.

  abstract: |-
    Bunge La Mwananchi (BLM) is a Kenyan grass-roots social movement that creates space for unrepresented people from the poorest backgrounds to raise and debate issues, and to amplify their social struggles.

    In 2015, BLM members carried out action research – supported by Institute of Development Studies (IDS) staff, as part of Making All Voices Count – to find out how the movement sustains its power against co-option and division. A key finding was the importance of reaching across differences of ethnicity, gender, class and geography to increase BLM’s influence.

    Following this, in 2016, long-standing BLM organisers and new members took part in a short accompanied participatory video project. This aimed to communicate the action research findings to the wider movement, and initiate further discussion of the implications. It also sought to raise awareness of the potential of using video recording and playback to open communication spaces between different BLM constituencies. As the Bunge movement is a verbal movement, video was considered an appropriate medium. However, there can be challenges in applying it effectively in practice, particularly in resource- and time-limited contexts.

    This research reflects on the experience of adapting and scaling down elements of the participatory video approach during the Bunge video project, to be resource- and cost-effective and less time-intensive. Lessons are drawn on how video processes can be applied creatively and accessibly to mediate exchange in similar contexts in the future.

  abstract: Humanitarianism has long been thought of as the promotion of human welfare.
    In the context of peace and war, humanitarianism refers to the delivery of safety
    and protection to vulnerable populations. But humanitarianism has another history
    – one that cannot be understood apart from a history of experimentation, including
    experimental colonial and postcolonial endeavours in foreign territories and on
    foreign bodies to test new technologies and to make them safe for use by more
    valued citizens often located in metropolitan states. In this article, I explore
    how the United Nations High Commission for Refugees' (UNHRC) repatriation of Afghan
    refugees from Pakistan between 2002 and 2007 constitutes a case of humanitarian
    experimentation because of how the UNHCR deployed iris recognition technology
    to control the flow of refugees across the Afghan/Pakistan border. I argue that
    the UNHCR's use of iris recognition technology not only served to detect ‘deserving’
    refugees, correct refugee movements, and innovate a manageable refugee. It also
    cultivated technological failures, corrected the technology's performance and
    linked local refugee databases to international biometric databases, all of which
    potentially introduced new insecurities into this border region and beyond. The
    effect of humanitarian experimentation in this case was to render the safety of
    refugees subordinate to the production of apparently safe technologies, so much
    so that refugees subjected to humanitarian experimentation in the world's dangerous
    ‘wild zones’ delivered ‘safety’ (by delivering presumably safer technologies)
    to citizens in the world's relatively secure ‘tame zones’ – not the other way
    around. In this way, the UNHCR's use of iris recognition technology made design
    safe for some citizens, but not for others.

  abstract: We describe Quizz, a gamified crowdsourcing system that simultaneously
    assesses the knowledge of users and acquires new knowledge from them. Quizz operates
    by asking users to complete short quizzes on specific topics; as a user answers
    the quiz questions, Quizz estimates the user's competence. To acquire new knowledge,
    Quizz also incorporates questions for which we do not have a known answer; the
    answers given by competent users provide useful signals for selecting the correct
    answers for these questions. Quizz actively tries to identify knowledgeable users
    on the Internet by running advertising campaigns, effectively leveraging the targeting
    capabilities of existing, publicly available, ad placement services. Quizz quantifies
    the contributions of the users using information theory and sends feedback to
    the advertising system about each user. The feedback allows the ad targeting mechanism
    to further optimize ad placement. Our experiments, which involve over ten thousand
    users, confirm that we can crowdsource knowledge curation for niche and specialized
    topics, as the advertising network can automatically identify users with the desired
    expertise and interest in the given topic. We present controlled experiments that
    examine the effect of various incentive mechanisms, highlighting the need for
    having short-term rewards as goals, which incentivize the users to contribute.
    Finally, our cost-quality analysis indicates that the cost of our approach is
    below that of hiring workers through paid-crowdsourcing platforms, while offering
    the additional advantage of giving access to billions of potential users all over
    the planet, and being able to reach users with specialized expertise that is not
    typically available through existing labor marketplaces.

  abstract: Online deliberation may provide a more cost-effective and/or less inhibiting
    environment for public participation than face to face (F2F). But do online methods
    bias participation toward certain individuals or groups? We compare F2F versus
    online participation in an experiment affording within-participants and cross-modal
    comparisons. For English speakers required to have Internet access as a condition
    of participation, we find no negative effects of online modes on equality of participation
    (EoP) related to gender, age, or educational level. Asynchronous online discussion
    appears to improve EoP for gender relative to F2F. Data suggest a dampening effect
    of online environments on black participants, as well as amplification for whites.
    Synchronous online voice communication EoP is on par with F2F across individuals.
    But individual-level EoP is much lower in the online forum, and greater online
    forum participation predicts greater F2F participation for individuals. Measured
    rates of participation are compared to self-reported experiences, and other findings
    are discussed.

  abstract: "The Open Government Partnership (OGP), donors and multilaterals, and
    social accountability practitioners across the world are among various constituencies
    attempting to harness and actualise emerging insights about the nature of successful
    governance reform. But each of these groups faces challenges as they do so. An
    increasingly compelling body of evidence suggests that governance reform is inherently
    political and complex, and that reform efforts are most likely to be successful
    when:\n- local stakeholders are at the forefront of defining governance challenges,
    developing and implementing solutions, and pursuing sustainable change; and \n-
    those stakeholders have the flexibility to learn and adapt as they go, especially
    when working in complex political contexts.\n\nThis brief reviews the evidence
    from Learning to Make All Voices Count (L-MAVC), a programme funded by Making
    All Voices Count, and implemented in collaboration with Global Integrity. L-MAVC
    intended to support six Making All Voices Count grantees, working in five countries,
    in co-creating and applying a participatory, learning-centred, and adaptive approach
    to strengthening citizen engagement in governance processes in their contexts,
    including with respect to the Open Government Partnership (OGP)."

  publication_name: Slave to Algorithm? Why a 'Right to Explanation' is Probably Not
    the Remedy You Are Looking For

  abstract: |
    Algorithms, particularly of the machine learning (ML) variety, are increasingly consequential to individuals’ lives but have caused a range of concerns evolving mainly around unfairness, discrimination and opacity. Transparency in the form of a “right to an explanation” has emerged as a compellingly attractive remedy since it intuitively presents as a means to “open the black box”, hence allowing individual challenge and redress, as well as possibilities to foster accountability of ML systems. In the general furore over algorithmic bias and other issues laid out in section 2, any remedy in a storm has looked attractive.

    However, we argue that a right to an explanation in the GDPR is unlikely to be a complete remedy to algorithmic harms, particularly in some of the core “algorithmic war stories” that have shaped recent attitudes in this domain. We present several reasons for this conclusion. First (section 3), the law is restrictive on when any explanation-related right can be triggered, and in many places is unclear, or even seems paradoxical. Second (section 4), even were some of these restrictions to be navigated, the way that explanations are conceived of legally — as “meaningful information about the logic of processing” — is unlikely to be provided by the kind of ML “explanations” computer scientists have been developing. ML explanations are restricted both by the type of explanation sought, the multi-dimensionality of the domain and the type of user seeking an explanation. However (section 5) “subject-centric" explanations (SCEs), which restrict explanations to particular regions of a model around a query, show promise for interactive exploration, as do pedagogical rather than decompositional explanations in dodging developers' worries of IP or trade secrets disclosure.

    As an interim conclusion then, while convinced that recent research in ML explanations shows promise, we fear that the search for a “right to an explanation” in the GDPR may be at best distracting, and at worst nurture a new kind of “transparency fallacy”. However, in our final section, we argue that other parts of the GDPR related (i) to other individual rights including the right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) and the right to data portability and (ii) to privacy by design, Data Protection Impact Assessments and certification and privacy seals, may have the seeds of building a better, more respectful and more user-friendly algorithmic society.

  abstract: "Recent years have witnessed something of a sea-change in the way humanitarian
    organizations consider and use data. Growing awareness of the potential of data
    has led to new enthusiasm and new, innovative applications that seek to respond
    to and mitigate crises in fresh ways. At the same time, it has become apparent
    that the potential benefits are accompanied by risks. A new framework is needed
    that can help balance the benefits and risks, and that can aid humanitarian organizations
    and others (e.g., policymakers) develop a more responsible approach to data collection
    and use in their efforts to combat natural and man-made crises around the world.
    \n\n“Mapping and Comparing Responsible Data Approaches”, attempts to guide the
    first steps toward such a framework by learning from current approaches and principles.
    It is the outcome of a joint research project commissioned by UNOCHA and conducted
    in collaboration between the GovLab at NYU and Leiden University. In an effort
    to better understand the landscape, we have considered existing data use policies
    and principles from 17 organizations. These include 7 UN agencies, 7 International
    Organizations, 2 government agencies and 1 research institute. Our study of these
    organizations’ policies allowed us to extract a number of key takeaways that,
    together, amount to something like a roadmap for responsible data use for any
    humanitarian organization considering using data in new ways."

  abstract: In recent years, the evolution of urban environments, jointly with the
    progress of the Information and Communication sector, have enabled the rapid adoption
    of new solutions that contribute to the growth in popularity of Smart Cities.
    Currently, the majority of the world population lives in cities encouraging different
    stakeholders within these innovative ecosystems to seek new solutions guaranteeing
    the sustainability and efficiency of such complex environments. In this work,
    it is discussed how the experimentation with IoT technologies and other data sources
    form the cities can be utilized to co-create in the OrganiCity project, where
    key actors like citizens, researchers and other stakeholders shape smart city
    services and applications in a collaborative fashion. Furthermore, a novel architecture
    is proposed that enables this organic growth of the future cities, facilitating
    the experimentation that tailors the adoption of new technologies and services
    for a better quality of life, as well as agile and dynamic mechanisms for managing
    cities. In this work, the different components and enablers of the OrganiCity
    platform are presented and discussed in detail and include, among others, a portal
    to manage the experiment life cycle, an Urban Data Observatory to explore data
    assets, and an annotations component to indicate quality of data, with a particular
    focus on the city-scale opportunistic data collection service operating as an
    alternative to traditional communications.

  abstract: Information and communication technologies (ICT) are changing the way
    people interact with each other. Today, every physical device can have the capability
    to connect to the Internet (digital presence) to send and receive data. Internet
    connected cameras, home automation systems, connected cars are all examples of
    interconnected Internet of Things (IoT). IoT can bring benefits to users in terms
    of monitoring and intelligent capabilities, however, these devices collect, transmit,
    store, and have a potential to share vast amount of personal and individual data
    that encroach private spaces and can be vulnerable to security breaches. The ecosystem
    of IoT comprises not only of users, various sensors, and devices but also other
    stakeholders of IoT such as data collectors, processors, regulators, and policy-makers.
    Even though the number of commercially available IoT devices is on steep rise,
    the uptake of these devices has been slow, and abandonment rapid. This paper explains
    how stakeholders (including users) and technologies form an assemblage in which
    these stakeholders are cumulatively responsible for making IoT an essential element
    of day-to-day living and connectivity. To this end, this paper examines open issues
    in data privacy and security policies (from perspectives of the European Union
    and North America), and its effects on stakeholders in the ecosystem. This paper
    concludes by explaining how these open issues, if unresolved, can lead to another
    wave of digital division and discrimination in the use of IoT.

  abstract: An in­course experiment provided undergraduate public policy students
    with tangible experience in dealing with unfair, discriminatory, intrusive, and
    arbitrary policies and practices similar to those that legally exist in government.
    Students were subjected to in­course policies that gave preferential status and
    enhanced opportunities to some classmates while others were punished or handicapped.
    Each of the seemingly arbitrary conditions has parallels in U.S. legal, economic,
    and social systems. The experiment was designed to enhance student learning through
    an immersion in a simulated policy environment and to offer a personalized experience
    of dealing with unjust and arbitrary policies. Experimental and control group
    responses were analyzed with a grounded research approach. The authors found that
    the immersive environment led to deeper knowledge of the policy situation and
    an understanding of how to get involved in a policy area to effect change. This
    study illustrates potential applications for active learning, simulated empathy,
    and student empowerment.

  abstract: Governments are increasingly adopting behavioral science techniques for
    changing individual behavior in pursuit of policy objectives. The type of “nudge”
    interventions that governments are now adopting alter people’s decisions without
    coercion or significant changes to economic incentives. We calculated ratios of
    impact to cost for nudge interventions and for traditional policy tools, such
    as tax incentives and other financial inducements, and we found that nudge interventions
    often compare favorably with traditional interventions. We conclude that nudging
    is a valuable approach that should be more often in conjunction with traditional
    policies, but more calculations are needed to determine the relative effectiveness
    of nudging.

  abstract: 'The provision of open data by governments at all levels has rapidly increased
    over recent years. Given that one of the dominant motivations for the provision
    of open data is to generate ''value,'' both economic and civic, there are valid
    concerns over the costs incurred in this pursuit. Typically, costs of open data
    are framed as costs that are internal to the data providing government. Building
    on the strong history of GIScience research on data provision via spatial data
    infrastructures, this paper considers both the direct and indirect costs of open
    data provision, framing four main areas of indirect costs: citizen participation
    challenges, uneven provision across geography and user types, subsidy of private
    sector activities, and the creation of inroads for corporate influence on government.
    These areas of indirect cost lead to the development of critical questions, including
    constituency, purpose, enablement, protection, and priorities. These questions
    are proposed as a guide to governments that provide open data in addressing the
    indirect costs of open data.'

  abstract: This paper describes the methodology and the research associated with
    the development of an open data course for social movements, in the hope that
    this approach can be interesting to researchers and practitioners working in the
    Community Informatics field. In the sections that follow we first picture the
    open data scene and selected social movements in Brazil (where this research was
    undertaken); then we present some open data education experiences, and the methodological
    inspirations and research ideas that led to the development of the open data course.
    A detailed description of the course is followed by an analysis and synthesis
    of its outcomes, and conclusions.

  abstract: |-
    There is a long history of governments, businesses, science and citizens producing and utilizing data in order to monitor, regulate, profit from and make sense of the urban world. Recently, we have entered the age of big data, and now many aspects of everyday urban life are being captured as data and city management is mediated through data-driven technologies.

    *Data and the City* is the first edited collection to provide an interdisciplinary analysis of how this new era of urban big data is reshaping how we come to know and govern cities, and the implications of such a transformation. This book looks at the creation of real-time cities and data-driven urbanism and considers the relationships at play. By taking a philosophical, political, practical and technical approach to urban data, the authors analyze the ways in which data is produced and framed within socio-technical systems. They then examine the constellation of existing and emerging urban data technologies. The volume concludes by considering the social and political ramifications of data-driven urbanism, questioning whom it serves and for what ends.

  abstract: Governments collect and produce large amounts of data. Increasingly, governments
    worldwide have started to implement open data initiatives and also launch open
    data portals to enable the release of these data in open and reusable formats.
    Therefore, a large number of open data repositories, catalogues and portals have
    been emerging in the world. The greater availability of interoperable and linkable
    open government data catalyzes secondary use of such data, so they can be used
    for building useful applications which leverage their value, allow insight, provide
    access to government services, and support transparency. The efficient development
    of successful open data portals makes it necessary to evaluate them systematic,
    in order to understand them better and assess the various types of value they
    generate, and identify the required improvements for increasing this value. Thus,
    the attention of this paper is directed particularly to the field of open data
    portals. The main aim of this paper is to compare the selected open data portals
    on the national level using content analysis and propose a new evaluation framework,
    which further improves the quality of these portals. It also establishes a set
    of considerations for involving businesses and citizens to create eservices and
    applications that leverage on the datasets available from these portals.

  abstract: This paper examines whether civic technology ICTs provide an effective
    method for enhancing the political efficacy of citizens, and their perceived accountability
    of governments. Using a survey-based methodology, a quantitative analysis was
    conducted of the users of civic action sites in the UK, Kenya, South Africa and
    USA. The key question examine is whether the particularized or citizen-audit actions
    that these sites facilitate have a spillover effect in altering the level to which
    citizens believe they are able to hold government to account. These results suggest
    that citizen efficacy and perceptions of government accountability are enhanced.
    Stark differences in user demographics between territories demonstrates a wide
    spectrum of civic technology usage, however, with common confidence in the efficacy
    of the ICT. The findings suggest that publication and user-facilitation of government
    information through the medium of civic technology in developed and developing
    countries increases feelings of external efficacy and government accountability.

  abstract: |-
    Transnational multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) – voluntary partnerships between governments, civil society, and the private sector – are an increasingly prevalent strategy for promoting government responsiveness and accountability to citizens. While most transnational MSIs involve using voluntary standards to encourage socially and environmentally responsible private sector behavior, a handful of these initiatives – the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (CoST), the Open Government Partnership (OGP), the Global Initiative on Fiscal Transparency (GIFT) and the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP) – focus on information disclosure and participation in the public sector. Unlike private sector MSIs, which attempt to supplement weak government capacity to enforce basic social and environmental standards through partnerships between businesses and civil society, public sector MSIs ultimately seek to bolster public governance. But how exactly are these MSIs supposed to work? And how much has actually been achieved?

    The purpose of this study is to identify and consolidate the current state of the evidence for public governance-oriented MSI effectiveness and impact. Researchers collected over 300 documents and interviewed more than two-dozen MSI stakeholders about their experiences with five public governance oriented multi-stakeholder initiatives.

    This report provides a ‘snapshot’ of the evidence related to these five MSIs, and suggests that the process of leveraging transparency and participation through these initiatives for broader accountability gains remains uncertain. The report highlights the ongoing process of defining MSI success and impact, and how these initiatives intersect with other accountability actors and processes in complex ways. The study closes with key recommendations for MSI stakeholders.

  abstract: |-
    A new generation of strategies for government accountability is needed, one that fully considers entrenched, institutional obstacles to change. Vertical integration of coordinated civil society policy monitoring and advocacy is one such strategy. Engaging each stage and level of public sector actions in an integrated way can locate the causes of accountability failures, show their interconnected nature, and leverage the local, national and transnational power shifts necessary to produce sustainable institutional change.

    This case study summary is one of seven that reflect on civil society monitoring and advocacy initiatives in the Philippines – all of which aim to improve government accountability in different sectors – through the lens of vertical integration.

    Bondoc Peninsula is a narrow strip of land located in the southern portion of Quezon province, approximately eight hours away from Manila. It is composed of twelve low-income municipalities. Largely dependent on the production of coconut, Bondoc Peninsula has a skewed system of land tenure under which ownership of large tracts is concentrated in the hands of a few elite families.

  abstract: "The use of digital communication technologies, and of mobile phones in
    particular, has seen an exponential rise in low- and middle-income countries over
    the last decade. These data, emitted as a byproduct of technologies such as mobile
    phone location information and calling metadata, have the potential to fill some
    of the problematic gaps in data resources available to country policymakers and
    international development organisations. Using three examples of current big data
    initiatives in the international development field, we examine the implications
    of these new types of data for development policy and planning: their advantages
    and drawbacks, emerging practices relating to their use, and how they potentially
    influence ideas and policies of development. We also assess the politics of these
    new types of digital data, which are often collected and processed by corporations
    or by researchers in industrialised countries. Our analysis indicates that these
    new data sources already represent an important complement to country-level statistics,
    but that there are currently important challenges which will need to addressed
    if the promises of big data in development are to be fulfilled.\n\n"

    In 2009, the Brazilian Ministry of Justice partnered with the academic organisation Center for Technology and Society of the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, to build a platform for a public consultation about a draft bill on Internet user rights - the "Internet Bill of Rights", or Marco Civil da Internet. A year later, the Brazilian Ministry of Culture put in place a similar process of public consultation for improving the copyright legislation - Copyright Forum - Fórum de Direito Autoral.

    Both, the Marco Civil and the Copyright Reform public consultations, were innovative exercises in the use of ICTs for improving citizen participation in law making. After the public consultation and other institutional measures, the Marco Civil was finally approved by Congress in 2014. By contrast, the bill resulting from the public consultation on Copyright Reform was never taken to Congress.

    This case study compares and contrasts the processes followed by these two participatory exercises. It analyses on the role played by different agents engaged in ICT-mediated citizen engagement, and new informational and communicative structures and their uses. The study highlights that both draft bills faced three distinct group of challenges: infrastructure, an enabling discussion environment and responsiveness. Comparing an experience that "went right" with one that "went wrong" raises hypotheses about the impact that different factors might play in a participatory process.

  abstract: The importance of data in informing the policy making process is being
    increasingly realized across the world. With India facing significant developmental
    challenges, use of data offers an important opportunity to improve the quality
    of public services. However, lack of formal structures to internalize a data-informed
    decision making process impedes the path to robust policy formation. This paper
    seeks to highlight these challenges through a case study of data dashboard implementation
    in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The study suggests the importance of capacity
    building, improvement of data collection and engagement off non-governmental players
    as measures to address issue

  abstract: |-
    Government “of the people, by the people, for the people” expresses an ideal that resonates in all democracies. Yet poll after poll reveals deep distrust of institutions that seem to have left “the people” out of the governing equation. Government bureaucracies that are supposed to solve critical problems on their own are a troublesome outgrowth of the professionalization of public life in the industrial age. They are especially ill-suited to confronting today’s complex challenges.

    Offering a far-reaching program for innovation, Smart Citizens, Smarter State suggests that public decisionmaking could be more effective and legitimate if government were smarter—if our institutions knew how to use technology to leverage citizens’ expertise. Just as individuals use only part of their brainpower to solve most problems, governing institutions make far too little use of the skills and experience of those inside and outside of government with scientific credentials, practical skills, and ground-level street smarts. New tools—what Beth Simone Noveck calls technologies of expertise—are making it possible to match the supply of citizen expertise to the demand for it in government.

    Drawing on a wide range of academic disciplines and practical examples from her work as an adviser to governments on institutional innovation, Noveck explores how to create more open and collaborative institutions. In so doing, she puts forward a profound new vision for participatory democracy rooted not in the paltry act of occasional voting or the serendipity of crowdsourcing but in people’s knowledge and know-how.

  abstract: "‘Exploring the Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing Countries
    (ODDC) was a 2 and a half year research driven project, beginning in February
    2013 with the goals of exploring how open data improves governance, and build
    capacity in these countries to engage with open data. The initial phase of this
    project was implemented through 17 sub- grants to partners from 12 countries and
    was evaluated in 2014. Over the last two years, the original research products
    have continued to be circulated and there is evidence that they have started to
    have a more noticeable effect on global understanding of open data. This evaluation
    provides an overview of what the impact of these activities have been on the wider
    open data policy world and on the research partners themselves."

  abstract: Over the last decade, traditional development institutions have joined
    market-based actors in embracing inclusive innovation to ensure the sector's relevance
    and impacts. In 2014, the UK's Department for International Development's (DFID)
    Innovation Hub launched Amplify as its own flagship initiative. The program, which
    is managed by IDEO, a Silicon Valley-based design consultancy, aims to crowdsource
    new ideas to various development challenges from a broad and diverse group fo
    actors, including poor people themselves. By examining the direction, diversity
    and distribution of Amplify's work, we argue that while development innovation
    can generate more inclusive practices, its transformative potential is constrained
    by broader developmental logics and policy regimes.

  abstract: In an increasingly digitised world, Information and Communication Technologies
    (ICTs) are playing a key role in human development. A consequence of this increased
    digitisation is the exponential increase in the being created. Data from multiple
    sources can be “mashed up” and processed using advanced analytics to provide deep
    and detailed insights on the world around us. However, there are many challenges
    in the use of “Big Data for Policy”, a key one being around the “Policy for Big
    Data”. An often understated aspect is the fact that much of this “big data” (especially
    in the emerging economies) is owned by the private sector that has the necessary
    wherewithal to collect and analyse it. Nevertheless, during the process of governing,
    the public sector creates “administrative data”, which is a unique resource. However,
    even creating administrative data in a form that can be linked together to create
    “big data” is fraught with challenges. The aim of this research is identify these
    challenges so that policy makers can attempt to mitigate them. Using the domain
    of land records, I have created a novel dataset on the proliferation of a land
    computerisation project in the states of India, seeking to identify the key factors
    behind the uneven uptake of this project in the states. I hypothesise that the
    diffusion of policies that seek to create digital records depend on three main
    factors-—the relative level of socio-economic development, the amount of support
    a policy would have amongst the populace and the complexity of policy adoption.
    The research finds significant evidence for all the three hypotheses.

    Barriers to young (especially unmarried) women’s participation in public spaces include the prevailing view that doing so violates social norms, young women’s often low level of education, and family expectations. Many young women have internalised their marginalisation and lack the confidence to participate in community forums.

    This practitioner research, carried out by women’s empowerment organisation FAMM Indonesia, (Forum Aktivis Perempuan Muda - Young Women Activists Forum) brings the voices of young women into the conversation about the allocation of local government resources and social accountability.

  abstract: |-
    Big data society has changed the traditional forms of data analysis and created a new predictive approach to knowledge and investigation. In this light, it is necessary to consider the impact of this new paradigm on the traditional notion of data protection and its regulation.

    Focussing on the individual and communal dimension of data use, encompassing digital investigations, the authors outline the challenges that big data poses for individual information self-determination, reasonable suspicion and collective interests. Therefore, the article suggests some innovative proposals that may update the existing data protection legal framework and contribute to make it respondent to the present algorithmic society.

  abstract: This paper explores the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing incident
    and how members of the general public, through the online community Reddit, attempted
    to provide assistance to law enforcement through conducting their own parallel
    investigations. As we document through an analysis of user posts, Reddit members
    shared information about the investigation, searched for information that would
    identify the perpetrators and, in some cases, drew on their own expert knowledge
    to uncover clues concerning key aspects of the attack. Although it is the case
    that the Reddit cyber-sleuths’ did not ultimately solve this case, or provide
    significant assistance to the police investigation, their actions suggest the
    potential role the public could play within security networks.

    edition is interested in studies that scrutinise big data and power in concrete
    fields of application. It brings together scholars from different disciplines
    who analyse the fields agriculture, education, border control and consumer policy.
    As will be made explicit in the following, each of the articles tells us something
    about firstly, what big data is and how it relates to power. They secondly also
    shed light on how we should shape “the big data society” and what research questions
    need to be answered to be able to do so.

  abstract: Algorithmic systems that employ machine learning play an increasing role
    in making substantive decisions in modern society, ranging from online personalization
    to insurance and credit decisions to predictive policing. But their decision-making
    processes are often opaque-it is difficult to explain why a certain decision was
    made. We develop a formal foundation to improve the transparency of such decision-making
    systems. Specifically, we introduce a family of Quantitative Input Influence (QII)
    measures that capture the degree of influence of inputs on outputs of systems.
    These measures provide a foundation for the design of transparency reports that
    accompany system decisions (e.g., explaining a specific credit decision) and for
    testing tools useful for internal and external oversight (e.g., to detect algorithmic
    discrimination). Distinctively, our causal QII measures carefully account for
    correlated inputs while measuring influence. They support a general class of transparency
    queries and can, in particular, explain decisions about individuals (e.g., a loan
    decision) and groups (e.g., disparate impact based on gender). Finally, since
    single inputs may not always have high influence, the QII measures also quantify
    the joint influence of a set of inputs (e.g., age and income) on outcomes (e.g.
    loan decisions) and the marginal influence of individual inputs within such a
    set (e.g., income). Since a single input may be part of multiple influential sets,
    the average marginal influence of the input is computed using principled aggregation
    measures, such as the Shapley value, previously applied to measure influence in
    voting. Further, since transparency reports could compromise privacy, we explore
    the transparency-privacy tradeoff and prove that a number of useful transparency
    reports can be made differentially private with very little addition of noise.
    Our empirical validation with standard machine learning algorithms demonstrates
    that QII measures are a useful transparency mechanism when black box access to
    the learning system is available. In particular, they provide better explanations
    than standard associative measures for a host of scenarios that we consider. Further,
    we show that in the situations we consider, QII is efficiently approximable and
    can be made differentially private while preserving accuracy.

  abstract: This article presents the results of a laboratory experiment and an online
    multi-country experiment testing the effect of motor vehicle eco-labels on consumers.
    The laboratory study featured a discrete choice task and questions on comprehension,
    while the ten countries online experiment included measures of willingness to
    pay and comprehension. Labels focusing on fuel economy or running costs are better
    understood, and influence choice about money-related eco-friendly behaviour. We
    suggest that this effect comes through mental accounting of fuel economy. In the
    absence of a cost saving frame, we do not find a similar effect of information
    on CO2 emissions and eco-friendliness. Labels do not perform as well as promotional
    materials. Being embedded into a setting, which is designed to capture the attention,
    the latter are more effective. We found also that large and expensive cars tend
    to be undervalued once fuel economy is highlighted.

  abstract: Algorithms (particularly those embedded in search engines, social media
    platforms, recommendation systems, and information databases) play an increasingly
    important role in selecting what information is considered most relevant to us,
    a crucial feature of our participation in public life. As we have embraced computational
    tools as our primary media of expression, we are subjecting human discourse and
    knowledge to the procedural logics that undergird computation. What we need is
    an interrogation of algorithms as a key feature of our information ecosystem,
    and of the cultural forms emerging in their shadows, with a close attention to
    where and in what ways the introduction of algorithms into human knowledge practices
    may have political ramifications. This essay is a conceptual map to do just that.
    It proposes a sociological analysis that does not conceive of algorithms as abstract,
    technical achievements, but suggests how to unpack the warm human and institutional
    choices that lie behind them, to see how algorithms are called into being by,
    enlisted as part of, and negotiated around collective efforts to know and be known.

  abstract: "This article seeks to map out the prospects of crowd-sourcing technologies
    in the area of corruption-reporting. A flurry of initiative and concomitant media
    hype in this area has led to exuberant hopes that the end of impunity is not such
    a distant possibility any more - at least not for the most blatant, ubiquitous
    and visible forms of administrative corruption, such as bribes and extortion payments
    that on average almost a quarter of citizens reported to face year in, year out
    in their daily lives in so many countries around the world (Transparency International
    2013). \n\nOnly with hindsight will we be able to tell, if these hopes were justified.
    However, a closer look at an interdisciplinary body of literature on corruption
    and social mobilisation can help shed some interesting light on these questions
    and offer a fresh perspective on the potential of social media based crowd-sourcing
    for better governance and less corruption. So far the potential of crowd-sourcing
    is mainly approached from a technology-centred perspective. Where challenges are
    identified, pondered, and worked upon they are primarily technical and managerial
    in nature, ranging from issues of privacy protection and fighting off hacker attacks
    to challenges of data management, information validation or fundraising. \n\nIn
    contrast, short shrift is being paid to insights from a substantive, multi-disciplinary
    and growing body of literature on how corruption works, how it can be fought and
    more generally how observed logics of collective action and social mobilisation
    interact with technological affordances and condition the success of these efforts.
    \n\nThis imbalanced debate is not really surprising as it seems to follow the
    trajectory of the hype-and-bust cycle that we have seen in the public debate for
    a variety of other technology applications. From electronic health cards to smart
    government, to intelligent transport systems, all these and many other highly
    ambitious initiatives start with technology-centric visions of transformational
    impact. However, over time - with some hard lessons learnt and large sums spent
    - they all arrive at a more pragmatic and nuanced view on how social and economic
    forces shape the implementation of such technologies and require a more shrewd
    design approach, in order to make it more likely that potential actually translates
    into impact.\n\nAt a minimum, a trawl through this literature makes it possible
    to move beyond some of the most common-sense conjectures and develop a few more
    granular guesses on the future of crowd-sourcing corruption. At best, this approach
    may help identify some not so obvious challenges that may arise along the way
    and ensure that they are considered in the design process of future corruption
    crowd-sourcing interventions, raising their likelihood of impact and sustainable
    success.\n\nThe remainder of this essay is structured as follows: Section 1 introduces
    the concept of crowd-sourcing for good governance. It provides a very brief overview
    of some related initiatives in this area, alongside some of the challenges and
    reservations that are commonly raised in the debate. Section 2 casts the net a
    bit wider. It looks for interesting insight and cues in the broader social science
    literature on social mobilisation and corruption. Based on this, it seeks to gain
    a better understanding of what other more fundamental challenges may lay ahead
    for crowd-reporting corruption. Section 3 picks up on these anticipated challenges
    and presents some ideas on how to address them, both in the design, as well as
    in the implementation of future crowd-reporting systems, drawing both on emerging
    insights from impact assessments of conventional social accountability mechanisms
    as well as lessons learnt within Transparency International’s own global network
    of anti-corruption NGOs, some of which already run crowd-reporting platforms.\n\n"

  abstract: This is an interdisciplinary article focusing on the interplay between
    information and communication technology (ICT) and international law (IL). Its
    purpose is to open up a dialogue between ICT and IL practitioners that focuses
    on the ways in which ICT can enhance equitable participation in international
    legal structures, particularly through capturing the possibilities associated
    with big data. This depends on the ability of individuals to access big data,
    for it to be structured in a manner that makes it accessible and for the individual
    to be able to take action based on it.

  abstract: Mechanisms of constitutional development have recently attracted significant
    attention, specifically, instances where popular involvement was central to the
    constitutional change. Examples include attempts by British Columbia, the Netherlands,
    and Ontario at electoral reform, in addition to the more sweeping reforms sought
    in Iceland and Ireland. Each of these countries’ attempts exemplifies varied innovative
    avenues to reform involving participatory and partially citizen-led processes
    aimed at revitalizing politics. The little legal scholarship on these developments
    has provided an insufficient analytical account of such novel approaches to constitution-making.
    This Essay seeks to build upon the current descriptive work on constitutional
    conventions by focusing on the cases of Iceland and Ireland. The Essay further
    aims to evaluate whether the means undertaken by each country translates into
    novelty at a more substantive level, namely, the quality of the process and legitimacy
    of the end product. The Essay proposes standards of direct democratic engagements
    that adequately fit these new developments and further identifies lessons for
    participatory constitution-making processes in the digital twenty-first century.

  abstract: Using case studies from Uganda and Kenya Development Research and Training
    (DRT) and Development Initiatives (DI) carried out research on the evolution of
    the open data movement in the two countries and assessed the role that the movement
    plays in the equitable allocation of financial resources for eradication of extreme
    and chronic poverty. Besides the role that existing and emerging open data processes
    in the two countries may be playing in promoting citizen/public engagement and
    the allocation of resources, the study set out to examine the possible negative
    impacts that might be emerging due to the “digital divide” between those who have
    access to and technology and therefore data and those who do not. Further, we
    sought to establish the extent to which access to data translates to effective
    use or not particularly in instances where human and financial resources and capacities
    are lacking. The study generally aimed to contribute to the understanding of which
    specific efforts are required to ensure “effective use”, which is the most important
    outcome of “open data”.

  abstract: 'Most environmental policy assumes the form of standards and enforcement.
    Scarce public budgets motivate the use of disclosure laws. This study explores
    a new form of pollution disclosure: real-time visual evidence of emissions provided
    on a free, public website. The paper tests whether the disclosure of visual evidence
    of emissions affects the nature and frequency of phone calls to the local air
    quality regulator. First, we test whether the presence of the camera affects the
    frequency of calls to the local air quality regulator about the facility monitored
    by the camera. Second, we test the relationship between the camera being active
    and the number of complaints about facilities other than the plant recorded by
    the camera. Our empirical results suggest that the camera did not affect the frequency
    of calls to the regulator about the monitored facility. However, the count of
    complaints pertaining to another prominent industrial polluter in the area, steel
    manufacturing plants, is positively associated with the camera being active. We
    propose two behavioral reasons for this finding: the prior knowledge hypothesis
    and affect heuristics. This study argues that visual evidence is a feasible approach
    to environmental oversight even during periods with diminished regulatory capacity.'

  abstract: "This book presents a coherent, novel vision of Smart Cities, built around
    a value-driven architecture. It describes the limitations of the contemporary
    notion of the Smart City and argues that the next development step must actively
    include not only the physical infrastructure, but information technology and human
    infrastructure as well, requiring the intensive integration of technical solutions
    form the Internet of Things (IoT) and social computing. \n\nThe book is divided
    into five major parts, the first of which provides both a general introduction
    and a coherent vision that ties together all the components that are required
    to realize the vision for Smart Cities. Part II then discusses the provisioning
    and governance of Smart City systems and infrastructures. In turn, Part III addresses
    the core technologies and technological enablers for managing the social component
    of the Smart City platform. Both parts combine state-of-the-art research with
    cutting-edge industrial efforts in the respective fields. Lastly, Part IV details
    a road map to achieving Cyber-Human Smart Cities. Rounding out the coverage, it
    discusses the concrete technological advances needed to move beyond contemporary
    Smart Cities and toward the Smart Cities of the future.\nOverall, the book provides
    an essential overview of the latest developments in the areas of IoT and social
    computing research, and outlines a research roadmap for a closer integration of
    the two areas in the context of the Smart City. As such, it offers a valuable
    resource for researchers and graduate students alike.\n"

  abstract: 'The goals of big data and privacy are fundamentally opposed to each other.
    Big data and knowledge discovery are aimed reducing information asymmetries between
    organizations and the data sources, whereas privacy is aimed at maintaining information
    asymmetries of data sources. A number of different definitions of privacy are
    used to investigate some of the tensions between different characteristics of
    big data and potential privacy concerns. Specifically, the author examines the
    consequences of unevenness in big data, digital data going from local controlled
    settings to uncontrolled global settings, privacy effects of reputation monitoring
    systems, and inferring knowledge from social media. In addition, the author briefly
    analyzes two other emerging sources of big data: police cameras and stingray for

  abstract: "On many platforms, including Facebook, algorithmic manipulatoins are
    performed routinely; they range from purposes as mundane as deciding the color
    of a button, to decisions as significant as which news article is shown to the
    public. These decisions are increasingly central to social, political, and civic
    processes; consequently, the algorithmic harms that may arise from such computational
    form a brand new category, including a spectrum of issues from libel to violence.
    What are the rules around automated code that posts to Twitter accounts (Twitter
    \"bots\")? Can a Twitter bot make a death threat? Can it buy illegal drugs or
    break the law? These questions have already moved beyond hypotheticals, and government
    authorities are attempting to come to terms with them. \n\nIn this article, I
    outline some of the challenges of grappling with algorithmic harms, especially
    in cases where algorithms act as de facto gatekeepers of consequences."

  abstract: |-
    An increasingly compelling body of evidence suggests that governance reform is inherently political and complex, and that reform efforts are most likely to be successful when:
    - local stakeholders are at the forefront of defining governance challenges, developing and implementing solutions, and pursuing sustainable change; and
    - those stakeholders have the flexibility to learn and adapt as they go, especially when working in complex political contexts.

    Yet despite an emerging consensus on the importance of local ownership, and interest in adaptive programming, many donors and multilaterals that seek to support governance reform continue to employ linear, compliance-driven project and programme management frameworks. As a result, implementers and local partners often lack space for learning and adaptation.

    This brief reviews the evidence from Learning to Make All Voices Count (L-MAVC), a programme funded by Making All Voices Count, and implemented in collaboration with Global Integrity. L-MAVC intended to support six Making All Voices Count grantees, working in five countries, in co-creating and applying a participatory, learning-centred, and adaptive approach to strengthening citizen engagement in governance processes in their contexts, including with respect to the Open Government Partnership (OGP).

  abstract: "Scholars know relatively little about why law enforcement agencies choose
    to share information with the public. Empirical research has shown that departments
    often do so to satisfy an external demand, whether in the form of a statute requiring
    information to be collected and disseminated, the presence of a consent decree,
    or some other similar pressure. There is also evidence that transparency is the
    product of a unique constellation of factors within agencies that lead certain
    departments to share more information than others. But this line of inquiry is
    underdeveloped, and questions remain about the both the nature and degree to which
    these external and internal factors matter. The current research focuses on the
    role of the police executive in generating the agency’s response to transparency
    demands, with a particular focus on that generated by civilian oversight agencies,
    and the role that top leadership plays in establishing an organizational culture
    that values openness and transparency. To address these issues we draw on the
    results of a series of Q-sorting exercises and the insights gleaned from several
    semi-structured interviews with municipal police chiefs and county sheriffs. Preliminary
    results suggest that the vision and goals of police        \nexecutives is critical
    to his or her department’s online transparency."

  abstract: |-
    The Social Innovation Lab emphasizes not only imagining high potential interventions but also gaining system sight, redefining problems, and identifying opportunities in the broader context with the potential to tip systems in positive directions. It is a three-step process of developing, testing and instigating innovation strategies. It requires the right starting conditions, an investment in research and skilled facilitators. It also makes use of computer modeling to proto-typing interventions in complex systems. Like other processes for convening multi-stakeholder groups working on complex challenges, it is best suited to the early stages of making change.

    This guide is offered as a resource to peers, colleagues, practitioners, leaders from all sectors, and concerned citizens - all who have and/or will participate in change-making processes. One hope for this work is that these ideas on Social Innovation and these recommendations for new practice will result in greater sense of agency for those who work on what often seems like impossible aspirations for a different, better world. Probably our greatest hope is that these ideas help to transform the impossible into the possible.

  abstract: 'The Internet is considered a huge development in human civilization.
    It is literally considered as a practical key or essential to human development
    and social advancement causing massive innovation in the world. Over the years,
    the advent of new media has permeated most aspects of our lives, especially that
    of the young generation. It is against this background that this paper aims to
    analyse the present use of the new media by youth to gauge their usage in relation
    to political participation. This study is a country wide survey covering Peninsula
    and East Malaysia. For sampling purposes the country is divided into six zones.
    A survey research using questionnaire as instrument was used to obtain data. Prior
    to the actual survey, a pilot study was first conducted. Some 1182 respondents
    age between 18 and 25 were randomly sampled from the six zones and selection of
    samples was based on ethnic ratio. The data was analysed descriptively and inferentially
    using SPSS 20.0 From the results, majority of the respondents, 89% are social
    media users having a social media account. A discouraging trend with regard to
    participation is the very low level of giving comments on general societal issues
    ranging from social issues, the environment to politics. The youth are more inclined
    to using the new media for entertainment and social networking. It is time to
    use the new media to engage with community leaders and politicians and comment
    on issues related to political issues. '

  abstract: 'Activity space is an important concept in geography. Recent advancements
    of location-aware technologies have generated many useful spatiotemporal data
    sets for studying human activity space for large populations. In this article,
    we use two actively tracked cellphone location data sets that cover a weekday
    to characterize people''s use of space in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. We introduce
    three mobility indicators (daily activity range, number of activity anchor points,
    and frequency of movements) to represent the major determinants of individual
    activity space. By applying association rules in data mining, we analyze how these
    indicators of an individual''s activity space can be combined with each other
    to gain insights of mobility patterns in these two cities. We further examine
    spatiotemporal variations of aggregate mobility patterns in these two cities.
    Our results reveal some distinctive characteristics of human activity space in
    these two cities: (1) A high percentage of people in Shenzhen have a relatively
    short daily activity range, whereas people in Shanghai exhibit a variety of daily
    activity ranges; (2) people with more than one activity anchor point tend to travel
    further but less frequently in Shanghai than in Shenzhen; (3) Shenzhen shows a
    significant north–south contrast of activity space that reflects its urban structure;
    and (4) travel distance in both cities is shorter around noon than in regular
    work hours, and a large percentage of movements around noon are associated with
    individual home locations. This study indicates the benefits of analyzing actively
    tracked cellphone location data for gaining insights of human activity space in
    different cities.'

  abstract: A behavioral divide cuts across the Atlantic. Despite the recent surge
    of behavioral analysis in European academia, a scrutiny of decisions by courts
    and regulatory agencies in the US and the EU reveals striking differences. While
    in the US rulings by courts and regulatory agencies progressively take insights
    from behavioral economics into account, EU courts and agencies still, and even
    increasingly, cling to the rational actor model. These inverse trends can be uncovered
    in the interpretation of legal concepts of human agency, ie, of those elements
    in a legal order which refer, implicitly or explicitly, to a model of rationality
    of human actors. More particularly, this paper reviews the concepts of consumers
    and of users, in consumer law and product liability respectively, to underscore
    the claim of the behavioral divide. Importantly, the divergence between EU and
    US private law practice calls for a normative evaluation. In the face of empirical
    uncertainty about the existence, direction and intensity of biases, the most attractive
    legal concept of human agency is a pluralistic one, assuming the simultaneous
    presence of boundedly and fully rational actors. In concrete applications, this
    paper shows that a pluralistic perspective urges a revision of the concept of
    the reasonable consumer, both in US and EU consumer law. Furthermore, such a view
    leads to the adoption of a more boundedly rational user concept in product liability.
    The pluralistic, yet more boundedly rational concepts thus have far-reaching consequences
    both for private law theory and its concomitant case law.

  abstract: |-
    Multi-stakeholder initiatives (i.e., partnerships between governments, civil society, and the private sector) are an increasingly prevalent strategy promoted by multilateral, bilateral, and nongovernmental development organizations for addressing weaknesses in public sector governance. Global public sector governance MSIs seek to make national governments more transparent and accountable by setting shared standards for information disclosure and multi-stakeholder collaboration. However, research on similar interventions implemented at the national or subnational level suggests that the effectiveness of these initiatives is likely to be mediated by a variety of socio-political factors.

    This dissertation examines the transnational evidence base for three global public sector governance MSIs — the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative, and the Open Government Partnership — and investigates their implementation within and across three shared national contexts — Guatemala, the Philippines, and Tanzania — in order to determine whether and how these initiatives lead to improvements in proactive transparency (i.e., discretionary release of government data), demand-driven transparency (i.e., reforms that increase access to government information upon request), and accountability (i.e., the extent to which government officials are compelled to publicly explain their actions and/or face penalties or sanction for them), as well as the extent to which they provide participating governments with an opportunity to project a public image of transparency and accountability, while maintaining questionable practices in these areas (i.e., openwashing).

    The evidence suggests that global public sector governance MSIs often facilitate gains in proactive transparency by national governments, but that improvements in demand-driven transparency and accountability remain relatively rare. Qualitative comparative analysis reveals that a combination of multi-stakeholder power sharing and civil society capacity is sufficient to drive improvements in proactive transparency, while the absence of visible, high-level political support is sufficient to impede such reforms. The lack of demand-driven transparency or accountability gains suggests that national-level coalitions forged by global MSIs are often too narrow to successfully advocate for broader improvements to public sector governance. Moreover, evidence for openwashing was found in one-third of cases, suggesting that national governments sometimes use global MSIs to deliberately mislead international observers and domestic stakeholders about their commitment to reform.

  abstract: Government-led citizen and stakeholder engagement is undertaken with the
    broad aims of improving government effectiveness and strengthening perceived legitimacy
    for government action. However, some aspects of the digital era that are challenging
    and stretching these traditions include changing economics of attention, heightened
    expectations of citizens and stakeholders, and a reconfiguration of the nature
    of policymaking discourse. Seven Government of Canada citizen and stakeholder
    engagement cases, spread over the past 27 years, are reviewed against the emergence
    of digital technologies within the context of traditional engagement exercises
    to understand how governments are experimenting with new approaches, and how new
    models may still be needed to respond to this shifting technology landscape. A
    future research agenda is sketched that anticipates how expanding technological
    capabilities, changing expectations on the part of citizens and stakeholders,
    and new approaches to policy discourse might require a reappraisal of our concepts
    of citizen and stakeholder engagement.

  abstract: Nowadays, public demands easy access to non-confidential government data,
    such as public digital information on health, industry, and culture that can be
    accessed on the Internet. This will lead departments within government to be efficient
    and more transparent. As the result, rapid development of applications will solve
    citizens' problems in many sectors. One Data Initiatives is the proof that the
    Government of Indonesia supports data transparency. This research investigates
    the implementation of open data in Indonesia based on Tim Berners Lee's five-star
    rating and open stage model by Kalampokis. The results show that data in Indonesia
    is mostly freely available in the Internet, but most of them are not machine-readable
    and do not support non-proprietary format. The drawback of Indonesia's open data
    is the lack of ability to link the existing data with other data sources. Therefore,
    Indonesia is still making initial steps with data inventories and beginning to
    publish key datasets of public interest.

  abstract: "We are living in a world awash in data. Accelerated interconnectivity,
    driven by the proliferation of internet-connected devices, has led to an explosion
    of data - big data. A race is now underway to develop new technologies and implement
    innovative methods that can handle the volume, variety, velocity, and veracity
    of big data and apply it smartly to provide decisive advantage and help solve
    major challenges facing companies and governments. \n\nFor policy makers in government,
    big data and associated technologies like machine-learning and artificial intelligence,
    have the potential to drastically improve their decision-making capabilities.
    How governments use big data may be a key factor in improved economic performance
    and national security. This publication looks at how big data can maximize the
    efficiency and effectiveness of government and business, while minimizing modern
    risks. Five authors explore big data across three cross-cutting issues: security,
    finance, and law. \n"

  abstract: 'This study of the diffusion and evolution of the 311 innovation in the
    form of citizen service centers and as a technology cluster has been designed
    to help identify the catalysts for the spread of government-to-citizen (G2C) technology
    in local government in order to better position future G2C technology for a more
    rapid rate of adoption. The 311 non-emergency number was first established in
    1996 and had spread to 80 local governments across the United States by 2012.
    This dissertation examines: what factors contributed to the adoption of 311 in
    American local governments over 100,000 in population; how did the innovation
    diffuse and evolve over time; and why did some governments’ communications with
    citizens became more advanced than others?'

  abstract: 'In this paper, we conceptualize Open Data ecosystems by analysing the
    major stakeholders in the UK. The conceptualization is based on a review of popular
    Open Data definitions and business ecosystem theories, which we applied to empirical
    data using a timeline analysis. Our work is informed by a combination of discourse
    analysis and in-depth interviews, undertaken during the summer of 2013. Drawing
    on the UK as a best practice example, we identify a set of structural business
    ecosystem properties: circular flow of resources, sustainability, demand that
    encourages supply, and dependence developing between suppliers, intermediaries,
    and users. However, significant gaps and shortcomings are found to remain. Most
    prominently, demand is not yet fully encouraging supply and actors have yet to
    experience fully mutual interdependence.'

  abstract: Too little attention has been paid by the open data movement to the institutional
    dynamics of governments and other public agencies; nor has the research community
    drawn sufficient attention to the institutional dynamics at play in the implementation
    of open data initiatives in public agencies. It is the institutionally-attuned
    measurement of emerging open data practice in government that this paper explores
    in order to develop a deeper understanding of the barriers to change from a default
    position of closed to a new openness in government as an institution. Using the
    cases of South Africa and Kenya, the study develops and tests a set of indicators
    that measure the extent to which open data practice has been embedded. The findings
    show that open data practice is not embedded within and across the governments
    examined. The paper concludes that open government data initiatives will continue
    to hit a wall of inertia unless openness can be reconciled with those institutionalized
    values and norms that prevail at all levels of government.

  abstract: Given that the Obama administration still relies on many strategies we
    would think of as sitting on the side of secrecy, it seems that the only lasting
    transparency legacy of the Obama administration will be data-driven or e-transparency
    as exemplified by the web interface ‘data.gov’. As the data-driven transparency
    model is exported and assumes an ascendant position around the globe, it is imperative
    that we ask what kind of publics, subjects, and indeed, politics it will produce.
    Open government data is not just a matter concerning accountability but is seen
    as a necessary component of the new ‘data economy’. To participate and benefit
    from this info-capitalist-democracy, the data subject is called upon to be both
    auditor and entrepreneur. This article explores the implications of responsibilization,
    outsourcing, and commodification on the contract of representational democracy
    and asks if there are other forms of transparency that might better resist neoliberal
    formations and re-politicize the public sphere.

  abstract: This paper is about how the concept of personal data mining, a term used
    to explain the individual use of dynamic data processing techniques to find hidden
    patterns and trends in large amounts of personal data, challenges the concept
    of data minimization. It is an attempt to demonstrate that fair information principles
    like data minimization, while providing a useful starting point for data protection
    laws, must give way to more nuanced legal rules and models. It stresses that a
    shift of paradigms from the current paternalistic approach to handling personal
    towards an empowered-user approach is needed in order to better protect privacy
    in light of recent advancements in technology.

  abstract: |-
    Movements are engines of change in society that enable citizens to create new and better paths to engage with government and to seek recourse on issues that matter to millions of people. At  rst glance, civic tech doesn’t appear to be a movement in the purest sense of the term, but on closer inspection, it does share some fundamental characteristics. Like a movement, civic tech is mission driven, is focused on making change that bene ts the public, and in most cases enables better public input into decision making.

    We believe that better understanding the essential components of movements, and observing the ways in which civic tech does nor does not behave like one, can yield insights on how we as a civic tech community can collectively drive the sector forward.

  abstract: 'This paper examines the roles, types and forms of virtual microtasking
    for emergency information management in order to better understand collective
    intelligence mechanisms an the potential for logistics response. Using three case
    studies this paper reviews the emerging body of knowledge in microtasking practices
    in emergency management to demonstrate how crowd-sourced information is captured
    and processed during emergency events to provide critical intelligence throughout
    the emergency cycle. It also considers the impact of virtual information collection,
    collation and management on traditional humanitarian operations and relief efforts.
    Based on the case studies the emergent forms of microtasking for emergency information
    management were identified. Opportunities for continuities, adaptions and innovations
    are explained. The contribution of virtual microtasking extends to all supply
    chain strategic domains to help maximize resource use and optimize service delivery

  abstract: Bloggers in India used social media and wikis to broadcast news and bring
    humanitarian aid to tsunami victims in South Asia. Terrorist groups like ISIS
    pour out messages and recruit new members on websites. The Internet is the new
    public square, bringing to politics a platform on which to create community at
    both the grassroots and bureaucratic level. Drawing on historical and contemporary
    case studies from more than ten countries, Irene S. Wu’s Forging Trust Communities
    argues that the Internet, and the technologies that predate it, catalyze political
    change by creating new opportunities for cooperation. The Internet does not simply
    enable faster and easier communication, but makes it possible for people around
    the world to interact closely, reciprocate favors, and build trust. The information
    and ideas exchanged by members of these cooperative communities become key sources
    of political power akin to military might and economic strength.

    Open Democracy Advice Centre (ODAC), a South African civil society organisation (CSO) working on transparency and accountability, has been heavily involved in the Open Government Partnership (OGP) since its inception. Through its contributions to and monitoring of South Africa’s OGP National Action Plans (NAPs), it saw that poor interdepartmental coordination was hindering the South African government’s ability to implement its ambitious commitments to revitalise the public service, promote transparency, and use technology to strengthen governance.

    Making All Voices Count gave ODAC a practitioner research and learning grant to see what could be learned about interdepartmental coordination from different contexts, how these relate to the South African context, and how interventions like the OGP can enhance the potential for interdepartmental coordination.

    of specific case studies. Incomplete systematic evidence on the scope and variety
    of these barriers has limited opportunities to maximize the value and use of public
    health data for science and policy.\n\n"

  abstract: Data-driven technologies are now being adopted, developed, funded, and
    deployed throughout the health care market at an unprecedented scale. But, as
    this O'Reilly report reveals, health care innovation contains more hurdles and
    requires more finesse than many tech startups expect. By paying attention to the
    lessons from the report's findings, innovation teams can better anticipate what
    they'll face, and plan accordingly.

  abstract: Amid unprecedented growth in access to information communication technologies
    (ICTs), particularly in the developing world, how can international actors, governments,
    and civil society organizations leverage ICTs and the data they generate to more
    effectively prevent violence and conflict? New research shows that there is huge
    potential for innovative technologies to inform conflict prevention efforts, particularly
    when technology is used to help information flow horizontally between citizens
    and when it is integrated into existing civil society initiatives.1 However, new
    technologies are not a panacea for preventing and reducing violence and conflict.
    In fact, failure to consider the possible knock-on effects of applying a specific
    technology can lead to fatal outcomes in violent settings. In addition, employing
    new technologies for conflict prevention can produce very different results depending
    on the context in which they are applied and whether or not those using the technology
    take that context into account. This is particularly true in light of the dramatic
    changes underway in the landscapes of violence and conflict on a global level.
    As such, instead of focusing on supply-driven technical fixes, those undertaking
    prevention initiatives should let the context inform what kind of technology is
    needed and what kind of approach will work best

  abstract: The humanitarian emergencies of past years have evidenced significant
    lack of cooperation and coordination among aid organizations. One way to improve
    the situation is that the big aid organizations leading the cooperation and coordination
    efforts in a given country make use of open aid data available online to rapidly
    evaluate the performance of all aid organizations, and then use the insights obtained
    as a complement to create better coordination strategies and policies. The big
    aid organizations can evaluate the performance using indicators. This research
    is about proposing two indicators based on a model (built from open aid data)
    of humanitarian aid viewed as an economic supply-demand system. The first indicator
    measures how is the supply of humanitarian aid proportional to the demands, and
    the second measures how well are aid organizations reaching the provinces with
    the most deficit of humanitarian aid. Both indicators were tested in the Afghanistan
    2015 humanitarian scenario. They brought to light information about which aid
    organizations and humanitarian areas (clusters) need greater improvement in coordination.

  abstract: Regulation is no longer the prerogative of either states or markets. Increasingly
    citizens in association with businesses catalyse regulation which marks the rise
    of a social sphere in regulation. Around the world, in San Francisco, Melbourne,
    Munich and Mexico City, citizens have sought to transform how and to what end
    economic transactions are conducted. For instance, 'carrot mob' initiatives use
    positive economic incentives, not provided by a state legal system, but by a collective
    of civil society actors in order to change business behaviour. In contrast to
    'negative' consumer boycotts, 'carrot mob' events use 'buycotts'. They harness
    competition between businesses as the lever for changing how and for what purpose
    business transactions are conducted. Through new social media 'carrot mobs' mobilize
    groups of citizens to purchase goods at a particular time in a specific shop.
    The business that promises to spend the greatest percentage of its takings on,
    for instance, environmental improvements, such as switching to a supplier of renewable
    energy, will be selected for an organized shopping spree and financially benefit
    from the extra income it receives from the 'carrot mob' event. 'Carrot mob' campaigns
    chime with other fundamental challenges to conventional economic activity, such
    as the shared use of consumer goods through citizens collective consumption which
    questions traditional conceptions of private property.

    This paper studies how the Global Open Data Index (GODI) mobilises different audiences and translates into open data policy and publication. As such, it urges for a broader vision of ‘impact’ that traces the users of governance indicators first, before describing how indicators translate into different actions. The findings should be read as a depiction of different types of impact, yet without claiming representativity across different contexts.

    Based on the interview sample, GODI drives change primarily from within government. Its international visibility and country rankings may incentivise and maintain high-level support for open data. In the absence of open data policies, GODI has been used to support commitment when combined with soft-policy tools. GODI also lays a baseline for agencies to improve and is used at multiple government levels to highlight progress around open data, despite non-comparability of results across years. GODI could help individual agencies and communicate more clearly what a good open dataset looks like.

    Background: To date, health research literature has focused on social network sites (SNS) either as tools to deliver health care, to study the effect of these networks on behavior, or to analyze Web health content. Less is known about the effectiveness of these sites as a method for collecting data for health research and the means to use such powerful tools in health research.
    Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the available literature and explore the use of SNS as a mode of collecting data for health research. The review aims to answer four questions: Does health research employ SNS as method for collecting data? Is data quality affected by the mode of data collection? What types of participants were reached by SNS? What are the strengths and limitations of SNS?
    Methods: The literature was reviewed systematically in March 2013 by searching the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, using the Ovid and PubMed interface from 1996 to the third week of March 2013. The search results were examined by 2 reviewers, and exclusion, inclusion, and quality assessment were carried out based on a pre-set protocol.
    Results: The inclusion criteria were met by 10 studies and results were analyzed descriptively to answer the review questions. There were four main results. (1) SNS have been used as a data collection tool by health researchers; all but 1 of the included studies were cross-sectional and quantitative. (2) Data quality indicators that were reported include response rate, cost, timeliness, missing data/completion rate, and validity. However, comparison was carried out only for response rate and cost as it was unclear how other reported indicators were measured. (3) The most targeted population were females and younger people. (4) All studies stated that SNS is an effective recruitment method but that it may introduce a sampling bias.
    Conclusions: SNS has a role in health research, but we need to ascertain how to use it effectively without affecting the quality of research. The field of SNS is growing rapidly, and it is necessary to take advantage of the strengths of this tool and to avoid its limitations by effective research design. This review provides an important insight for scholars who plan to conduct research using SNS.

    Imagine if U.S. companies' compliance costs could be reduced, by billions of dollars. Imagine if this could happen without sacrificing any transparency to investors and governments. Open data can make that possible.

    This first-ever research report, co-published by the Data Foundation and PwC, explains how Standard Business Reporting (SBR), in which multiple regulatory agencies adopt a common open data structure for the information they collect, reduces costs for both companies and agencies.

    SBR programs are in place in the Netherlands, Australia, and elsewhere - but the concept is unknown in the United States. Our report is intended to introduce SBR to U.S. policymakers and lay the groundwork for future change

  abstract: The quality of life was significantly improved in the last century mainly
    as regards to the access to services. However, the heavy industrialization and
    the increasing population in the urban areas has been a big challenge for administrators,
    architects and urban planners. This paper provides a brief presentation of the
    evolution of the "smart city" term and the most representative characteristics
    of it. Furthermore, various alternative terms that were proposed to describe the
    multiple characteristics of the future cities are analyzed. A connection between
    a smart city and a smart grid is also presented.

  abstract: "The Internet of Things is increasingly spreading into the domain of medical
    and social care. Internet-enabled devices for monitoring and managing the health
    and well-being of users outside of traditional medical institutions have rapidly
    become common tools to support healthcare. Health-related Internet of Things (H-IoT)
    technologies increasingly play a key role in health management, for purposes including
    disease prevention, real-time tele-monitoring of patient’s functions, testing
    of treatments, fitness and well-being monitoring, medication dispensation, and
    health research data collection. H-IoT promises many benefits for health and healthcare.
    However, it also raises a host of ethical problems stemming from the inherent
    risks of Internet enabled devices, the sensitivity of health-related data, and
    their impact on the delivery of healthcare. This paper maps the main ethical problems
    that have been identified by the relevant literature and identifies key themes
    in the on-going debate on ethical problems concerning H-IoT.\n\n"

  abstract: This article draws on a case study of organisation–citizen engagement
    during railway infrastructure planning in southwest France, to examine the nature
    of participatory democracy, both conceptually—as elucidated by Habermas and others—and
    empirically, as recently practised within the framework of a model established
    in one democratically governed country. We analyse roles played by the state organisation
    responsible for building railway infrastructure; the National Commission for Public
    Debate; and the Garants, who oversee and facilitate the participatory process
    as laid down by the French law of Public Debate. We conclude by arguing that despite
    its normative aspects and its lack of provision for analysis of power relations,
    Habermas’s theory of communicative action can be used to evaluate the quality
    of organisation–citizen engagement, potentially providing a basis for informing
    actual models of democratic participation.

  abstract: |
    The interaction between barriers to data sharing in public health is complex, and single solutions to single barriers are unlikely to be successful. Political, economic and legal obstacles will be the most challenging to overcome.

    Public health data sharing occurs extensively as a collection of subregional and regional surveillance networks. These existing networks have often arisen as a consequence of a specific local public health crisis, and should be integrated into any global framework.

    Data sharing in public health is successful when a perceived need is addressed, and the social, political and cultural context is taken into account.

    A global data sharing legal framework is unlikely to be successful. A global data governance or ethical framework, supplemented by local memoranda of understanding that take into account the local context, is more likely to succeed.

    The International Health Regulations (IHR) should be considered as an infrastructure for data sharing. However, their lack of enforcement mechanism, lack of minimum data sets, lack of capacity assessment mechanism, and potential impact on trade and travel following data sharing need to be addressed.

    Optimal data sharing does not equate with open access for public health data.

  abstract: 'How does an increase in transparency affect policy deliberation? Increased
    government transparency is commonly advocated as beneficial to democracy. Others
    argue that transparency can undermine democratic deliberation by, for example,
    causing poorer reasoning. We analyze the effect of increased transparency in the
    case of a rare natural experiment involving the Federal Open Market Committee
    (FOMC). In 1994 the FOMC began the delayed public release of verbatim meeting
    transcripts and announced it would release all transcripts of earlier, secret,
    meetings back into the 1970s. To assess the effect of this change in transparency
    on deliberation, we develop a measure of an essential aspect of deliberation,
    the use of reasoned arguments. Our contributions are twofold: we demonstrate a
    method for measuring deliberative reasoning and we assess how a particular form
    of transparency affected ongoing deliberation. In a regression model with a variety
    of controls, we find increased transparency had no independent effect on the use
    of deliberative reasoning in the FOMC. Of particular interest to deliberative
    scholars, our model also demonstrates a powerful role for leaders in facilitating
    deliberation. Further, both increasing participant equality and more frequent
    expressions of disagreement were associated with greater use of deliberative language.'

  abstract: |-
    Data from clinical trials, including participant-level data, are being shared by sponsors and investigators more widely than ever before. Some sponsors have voluntarily offered data to researchers, some journals now require authors to agree to share the data underlying the studies they publish, the Office of Science and Technology Policy has directed federal agencies to expand public access to data from federally funded projects, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have proposed the expansion of access to data submitted in regulatory applications. Sharing participant-level data may bring exciting benefits for scientific research and public health but may also have unintended consequences. Thus, expanded data sharing must be pursued thoughtfully.
    We provide a suggested framework for broad sharing of participant-level data from clinical trials and related technical documents. After reviewing current data-sharing initiatives, potential benefits and risks, and legal and regulatory implications, we propose potential governing principles and key features for a system of expanded access to participant-level data and evaluate several governance structures.

  abstract: |
    Throughout the United States, there is broadly emerging support to significantly enhance the nation’s capacity for evidence-based policymaking. This support is shared across the public and private sectors and all levels of geography. In recent years, efforts to enable evidence-based analysis have been authorized by the U.S. Congress, and funded by state and local governments, and philanthropic foundations.

    The potential exists for substantial change. There has been dramatic growth in technological capabilities to organize, link and analyze massive volumes of data from multiple, disparate sources. A major resource is administrative data, which offers both advantages and challenges in comparison to data gathered through the surveys that have been the basis for much policymaking to date. To date, however, capability-building efforts have been largely “artisanal” in nature. As a result, the ecosystem of evidence-based policymaking capacity-building efforts is thin and weakly connected.

  abstract: Innovation policymakers need timely, detailed data about scientific research
    trends and networks to monitor their evolution and put in place suitable strategies
    to support them. We have analysed the Gateway to Research, an open dataset about
    research funding and university-industry collaborations in the UK in a project
    to map innovation in Wales. We use supervised learning and Natural Language Processing
    to improve data coverage and measure activity in research topics, build a recommendation
    engine to identify new opportunities for collaboration in the Welsh innovation
    system, and present the results through interactive visualisations. Our results
    suggest that Wales is becoming more competitive in areas identified as strategic
    targets by Welsh Government, that its research ecosystem is geographically diversified,
    and that research collaborations tend to take place between organisations that
    are geographically close. The data sources and methods we have used in the project
    can help understand this system better, and support it more effectively.

  abstract: Scientific studies investigating laws and regularities of human behavior
    are nowadays increasingly relying on the wealth of widely available digital information
    produced by human social activity. In this paper we leverage big data created
    by three different aspects of human activity (i.e., bank card transactions, geotagged
    photographs and tweets) in Spain for quantifying city attractiveness for the foreign
    visitors. An important finding of this papers is a strong superlinear scaling
    of city attractiveness with its population size. The observed scaling exponent
    stays nearly the same for different ways of defining cities and for different
    data sources, emphasizing the robustness of our finding. Temporal variation of
    the scaling exponent is also considered in order to reveal seasonal patterns in
    the attractiveness.

  abstract: The growth and globalization of the Internet over the past 40 years has
    been nothing short of remarkable. Virtually all sectors, from development to healthcare
    to education to politics, have been transformed. Yet developments in how the Internet
    is governed have not kept pace with this rapid technological innovation. Figuring
    out how to evolve the Internet’s governance in ways that are effective and legitimate
    is essential to ensure its continued potential. Flexible and innovative decision-making
    mechanisms are needed in order to enable disparate governance actors to address
    and respond effectively as changes in the network occur. This paper seeks to address
    the need to develop an effective and legitimate Internet governance ecosystem
    by proposing a distributed yet coordinated framework that can accommodate a plurality
    of existing and emerging decision-making approaches. It draws on the lessons of
    open governance, adopting innovative techniques to facilitate coordination, information
    sharing, and evidence generation by and across increasingly diverse and global
    groups of Internet actors, and calls for creating practical tools to support such
    an effective, legitimate and evolving Internet governance ecosystem. Although
    no right answer or single model for how to manage all issues of relevance to the
    Internet is suggested within this paper, the proposed framework intends to allow
    for diverse experiments in distributed governance approaches to learn what works
    and what does not.

    1980s. Indicators and rankings play an increasing role in the way governmental
    and non-governmental organizations distribute attention, make decisions, and allocate
    scarce resources. Quantitative knowledge promises to be more objective and straightforward
    as well as more transparent and open for public debate than qualitative knowledge,
    thus producing more democratic decision-making. However, we know little about
    the social processes through which this knowledge is constituted nor its effects.
    Understanding how such numeric knowledge is produced and used is increasingly
    important as proliferating technologies of quantification alter modes of knowing
    in subtle and often unrecognized ways. This book explores the implications of
    the global multiplication of indicators as a specific technology of numeric knowledge
    production used in governance.

  abstract: The Web is here to stay – yet it still divides opinion. There are optimists,
    like the Mozilla community and like the betterplace lab team, that believe the
    Internet can be a powerful force for good in our society – by making information
    and services available to all, by letting citizens speak, be heard, and hold the
    powerful to account. But this is not the full picture. Throughout the Internet’s
    relatively short history, we have had to contend with a series of menaces threatening
    to shackle or undermine this public resource. At one time we were suffocating
    under an avalanche of spam emails and pop-ups. Today we’re asking how we can protect
    individuals’ privacy when every click may be monitored by data mining corporations
    and state surveillance agents. This report is both a contribution to this nascent
    discussion, and it shows the current state of knowledge of, and current opinions
    of, groups which will be absolutely key participants.

  abstract: Every day, corporations are connecting the dots about our personal behavior—silently
    scrutinizing clues left behind by our work habits and Internet use. The data compiled
    and portraits created are incredibly detailed, to the point of being invasive.
    But who connects the dots about what firms are doing with this information? The
    Black Box Society argues that we all need to be able to do so—and to set limits
    on how big data affects our lives. Hidden algorithms can make (or ruin) reputations,
    decide the destiny of entrepreneurs, or even devastate an entire economy. Shrouded
    in secrecy and complexity, decisions at major Silicon Valley and Wall Street firms
    were long assumed to be neutral and technical. But leaks, whistleblowers, and
    legal disputes have shed new light on automated judgment. Self-serving and reckless
    behavior is surprisingly common, and easy to hide in code protected by legal and
    real secrecy. Even after billions of dollars of fines have been levied, underfunded
    regulators may have only scratched the surface of this troubling behavior. Frank
    Pasquale exposes how powerful interests abuse secrecy for profit and explains
    ways to rein them in. Demanding transparency is only the first step. An intelligible
    society would assure that key decisions of its most important firms are fair,
    nondiscriminatory, and open to criticism. Silicon Valley and Wall Street need
    to accept as much accountability as they impose on others.

  abstract: 'Crowdsourcing has proliferated across disciplines and professional fields.
    Implementers in the public sector face practical challenges, however, in the execution
    of crowdsourcing. This review synthesizes prior crowdsourcing research and practices
    from a variety of disciplines and focuses to identify lessons for meeting the
    practical challenges of crowdsourcing in the public sector. It identifies three
    distinct categories of crowdsourcing: organizations, products and services, and
    holistic systems. Lessons about the fundamental logic process design - alignment,
    motivation, and evaluation - identified across the three categories are discussed.
    Conclusions drawn from past studies and the result in evidence can help public
    managers better design and implement crowdsourcing in the public sector.'

  abstract: 'In the last 15 years, European countries have invested considerable resources
    to provide e-government services. Despite of its increasing availability, its
    level of adoption has not been satisfying. On the other hand, over the last years,
    coinciding with the web 2.0 trend, the e-government services co-produced by citizens
    start to appear, often without the support, acknowledgement and even awareness
    of the government. This trend stems from a well-established tradition of offline
    co- production of public services, i.e. services provided by the voluntary sector,
    but brought to an unprecedented scale thanks to the advent of web 2.0. Still,
    the concept remains not well-defined and its impact is not yet well studied. The
    paper explores on a limited sets of cases what does it mean to collaboratively
    deliver online public services; what are the success factors based on the cases
    under study and what are the incentives for service providers (other than public
    administration), citizens as users and public administration. The authors propose
    an ostensive definition of the collaborative delivery of public services: collaborative
    public services are created and run by government, civil society or by private
    sector building on the re-use of government data or citizens data. Those services
    are focused on public goods delivery (e.g. health, education, public transport)
    and are meant to change the traditional government services by engaging in an
    open dialogue with public administration about the best way to deliver those services.
    The analysis of six case studies of innovative collaborative online public services
    suggests that the online collaborative public service delivery increases its quality
    with the users׳ growth contrary to the traditional offline service delivery. The
    study results indicate that the current developers interest lies in delivering
    complementary services to the government run services rather than substitutive
    services. The authors propose also the initial list of success factors, enabling
    conditions, and benefits for all main stakeholders (users, innovators and public
    administration).'

  abstract: Ensemble is an interdisciplinary research team, working to explore the
    opportunity of new and emergent digital technologies in understanding, mitigating
    and adapting to environmental change. Using methods drawn from computer science,
    environmental science, social science, statistics, art, design and writing the
    team aim to transform the work of environmental scientists and decision makers,
    and the experience of communities by addressing themes related to complexity,
    uncertainty and abstraction of data. This paper discusses activities undertaken
    within a research ‘sprint’ directed at addressing flood risk management through
    data driven decision making, communication and community engagement.

  abstract: 'This case study considers Internet exchange points (IXPs) as an example
    of governance processes in action. Internet exchange points are the points of
    connection between different Internet networks, which enable different networks
    to exchange traffic at a shared facility without cost to either party through
    a process known as “peering”. Three different IXP governance models representing
    large and influential IXPs are compared: the DE-CIX in Frankfurt, CAIX in Cairo,
    and KIXP in Nairobi. DE-CIX, the largest IXP in the world, is a subsidiary of
    the German Internet trade association eco, and is thus “owned” by the Internet
    industry in Germany. Though well functioning, this has meant that key stakeholder
    groups such as civil society, and the academic and technical communities are excluded
    from participating in discussions over policy decisions. In contrast, the Cairo
    Internet Exchange Point (CAIX) is run by a public authority, the Egyptian Ministry
    of Communications and Information Technology. Though it is governed by a broad
    set of stakeholders including private sector, government, and civil society representatives,
    its decision-making processes are somewhat opaque. Lastly, KIXP was founded by
    a Kenyan network engineer and is governed by a local trade association. While
    set up with multistakeholder coordination under the leadership of the private
    sector, its day- to-day operations and governance fall under private sector control.
    By tracing out the plurality of models used for IXP governance and comparing the
    processes of developing peering relationships, this case provides unique lessons
    for the governance process, particularly surrounding trade-offs between inclusiveness
    and effectiveness.'

  abstract: The growing availability and use of social media and other mass collaboration
    technologies present new opportunities and challenges for disaster management.
    Platforms now exist that permit collection of data from broad constituencies and
    rapid communication with endangered communities, but this new interface between
    the informality of “the crowd” and the formality of policy frameworks raises important
    questions. These questions pertain to best practices, ways to integrate crowdsourced
    data with more traditional sources of data, and the identification of tools and
    approaches that should be leveraged in particular contexts. Groups engaging with
    these tools to support disaster response are often from disconnected industries
    and institutions, compounding the challenges. The “Connecting Grassroots to Government
    for Disaster Management” workshop was held to identify, assess, and address these
    opportunities and challenges. The workshop brought together the formal disaster
    response community, technology developers, digital volunteers, academic researchers,
    and the private sector. This report documents the conversations that emerged in
    this workshop, with particular attention to confirmed or disputed presuppositions,
    priority research opportunities, and the formal response community’s needs and
    capabilities.

  abstract: |-
    We are living in an era of digitization thus moving towards a digital government. The use of ICT in public-administration is beneficial and it is not mere a coincidence that the top 10 countries in e-government implementation (according to UN E-Government Survey 2016) are flourishing democracies. There has been a sharp rise in the number of countries using e-government to provide public services online through one stop-platform. According to the 2016 survey, 90 countries now offer one or more single entry portal on public information or online services, or both and 148 countries provide at-least one form of online transaction services. More and more countries are making efforts through e-government to ensure and increase inclusiveness, effectiveness, accountability and transparency in their public institutions. Across the globe, data for public information and security is being opened up. The 2016 survey shows that 128 countries now provide data-sets on government spending in machine readable formats. E-government and innovation seems to have provided significant opportunities to transform public administration into an instrument of sustainable development. The governments around the globe are rapidly transforming. The use of information and communication technology in public administration – combined with organizational change and new skills- seems to be improving public services and democratic processes and strengthening support to public policies. There has been an increased effort to utilize advanced electronic and mobile services that benefits all. Fixed and wireless broadband subscriptions have increased unevenly across regions, with Europe leading, but Africa still lagging behind. We have to focus on these substantial region disparities and growing divide. All countries agreed, in SDG 9, that a major effort is required to ensure universal access to internet in the least developed countries. The rise of Social media and its easy access seems to have enabled an increasing number of countries moving towards participatory decision making, in which developed European countries are among the top 50 performers. But, the issues of diminishing collective thinking and rising Individual thinking are some rising issues that we will have to deal with in the future. There are more sensitive issues like the new classification of citizens into literate-illiterate, e-literate and e-illiterate, that the governments need to look upon. It is a good sign that many developing countries are making good progress. Enhanced e-participation can support the realization of the SDGs by enabling more participatory decision making, but the success of e-government will ultimately depend upon our ability and capability to solve the contrasting issues raised due to this transition with sensitivity.

    In this issue of SOCRATES we have discussed, this new era of Digital Government. We have focused on what we have learned from the past and the future we want. From discussions on the role of e-governance within the local government settings in a modern democratic state to the experience of an academia with online examination, we have tried to include every possible aspect of e-government.

  abstract: We conduct a systematic survey with the aim of assessing open government
    data initiatives, that is; any attempt, by a government or otherwise, to open
    data that is produced by a governmental entity. We describe the open government
    data life-cycle and we focus our discussion on publishing and consuming processes
    required within open government data initiatives. We cover current approaches
    undertaken for such initiatives, and classify them. A number of evaluations found
    within related literature are discussed, and from them we extract challenges and
    issues that hinder open government initiatives from reaching their full potential.
    In a bid to overcome these challenges, we also extract guidelines for publishing
    data and provide an integrated overview. This will enable stakeholders to start
    with a firm foot in a new open government data initiative. We also identify the
    impacts on the stakeholders involved in such initiatives.

  abstract: Recognizing the potential of data innovation, the United Nations Development
    Programme (UNDP) innovation teams at the Regional Centre for Europe and the Commonwealth
    of Independent States (ECIS) and the Regional Hub for Arab States embarked on
    a “big data for development exploration journey,” seeking to harness new sources
    of data to improve services or programme implementation on topics including disaster
    risk management, improved welfare, migration, and poverty reduction. As part of
    this exercise, six UNDP Offices from the two regions developed data innovation
    proof-of-concept projects with governmental and civil society partners, to address
    urgent local challenges and gain hands-on experience in data innovation. UN Global
    Pulse provided technical guidance, coaching and tools to the project managers
    for the duration of the exercise, and the cohort shared advice and challenges
    at in-person workshops. This guide is based on these experiences, and on the methodology
    created by Global Pulse to design and implement data innovation projects across
    the UN system.

  abstract: 'Responsive City is a guide to civic engagement and governance in the
    digital age that will help leaders link important breakthroughs in technology
    and data analytics with age-old lessons of small-group community input to create
    more agile, competitive, and economically resilient cities. Featuring vivid case
    studies highlighting the work of pioneers in New York, Boston, Chicago and more,
    the book provides a compelling model for the future of governance. The book will
    help mayors, chief technology officers, city administrators, agency directors,
    civic groups and nonprofit leaders break out of current paradigms to collectively
    address civic problems. The Responsive City is the culmination of research originating
    from the Data-Smart City Solutions initiative, an ongoing project at Harvard Kennedy
    School working to catalyze adoption of data projects on the city level. The book
    is co-authored by Professor Stephen Goldsmith, director of Data-Smart City Solutions
    at Harvard Kennedy School, and Professor Susan Crawford, co-director of Harvard''s
    Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
    penned the book’s foreword.  Based on the authors’ experiences and extensive research,
    The Responsive City explores topics including: Building trust in the public sector
    and fostering a sustained, collective voice among communities; Using data-smart
    governance to preempt and predict problems while improving quality of life; Creating
    efficiencies and saving taxpayer money with digital tools; and Spearheading these
    new approaches to government with innovative leadership.

  abstract: Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is an emerging and growing industry
    that is having considerable effects on environments and health. Yet fracking often
    lacks environmental regulations that might be understood as governmental forms
    of care. In some locations in the US, citizens have taken up environmental monitoring
    as a way to address this perceived absence of care, and to evidence harm in order
    to argue for new infrastructures of care. This article documents the practices
    of residents engaged in monitoring air pollution near fracking sites in the US,
    as well as the participatory and practice-based research undertaken by the Citizen
    Sense research project to develop monitoring kits for residents to use and test
    over a period of seven months. Citizen sensing practices for monitoring air pollution
    can constitute ways of expressing care about environments, communities and individual
    and public health. Yet practices for documenting and evidencing harm through the
    ongoing collection of air pollution data are also speculative attempts to make
    relevant these unrecognized and overlooked considerations of the need for care.
    Working with the concept of speculation, this article advances alternative notions
    of evidence, care and policy that attend to citizens' experiences of living in
    the gas fields. How do citizen sensing practices work toward alternative ways
    of evidencing harm? In what ways does monitoring with environmental sensors facilitate
    this process? And what new speculative practices emerge to challenge the uses
    of environmental sensors, as well as to expand the types of data gathered, along
    with their political impact?

  abstract: Effective data sharing between peacebuilders can improve coordination
    of peacebuilding interventions in conflict zones. To support such coordination,
    however, data sharing must occur between organizations with widely differing goals
    and methods. Despite this, all participants in an intervention must have positive
    incentives to adopt such technologies. To engage government and non-government
    actors in data sharing, such systems must recognize the social dimensions of the
    data sharing problem, provide tools to build and maintain trust between actors,
    support on-going interaction to sustain that trust as in recent civilian-military
    policy discussions, and be strongly aligned with user needs. Elmer Roman, Oversight
    Executive in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and Melanie Greenberg, the
    President and CEO of Alliance for Peacebuilding, convened a group of experts in
    information and communications technology (ICT) and in peacebuilding. Experts
    in peacebuilding, information technology, and interagency coordination met to
    discuss the principal technological, ethical and organizational challenges faced
    by peacebuilders in working cooperatively to build peace. Participants also provided
    feedback on UNITY, a software platform developed by the Department of Defense
    (DOD) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to share
    project data related to humanitarian and peacebuilding activities. Co-published
    by the U.S. Institute of Peace and the National Academy of Engineering, this summary
    provides a synopsis of the workshop’s discussion. It is intended to help policy
    makers understand the issues associated with using data sharing for more effective
    coordination among actors in conflict zones.

  abstract: |-
    In recent years, Indonesia has seen significant growth in the number of initiatives that aim to tackle governance challenges through information and communications technologies (ICTs). Established by both the government and civil society organisations (CSOs), these have sought to increase public accountability, improve the delivery of public services, and strengthen the capacity of civil society to engage in accountability work.

    Some of these have been successful, helping to strengthen public accountability and contributing to the emergence of transparent government practices and better communication between the government and civil society. However, many initiatives still fail to achieve their desired impact, are unsustainable, or are used only minimally by the groups they aim to reach and involve.

    To improve understanding of why some ICT initiatives fail, this research compared ten ICT-based governance initiatives in Indonesia, with a focus on Open Data initiatives. The key themes covered in the paper are:  ICTs for governance; ICT ecosystems; public service delivery.

  abstract: Crowdsourcing offers unprecedented potential for solving tasks efficiently
    by tapping into the skills of large groups of people. A salient feature of crowdsourcing---its
    openness of entry---makes it vulnerable to malicious behavior. Such behavior took
    place in a number of recent popular crowdsourcing competitions. We provide game-theoretic
    analysis of a fundamental tradeoff between the potential for increased productivity
    and the possibility of being set back by malicious behavior. Our results show
    that in crowdsourcing competitions malicious behavior is the norm, not the anomaly---a
    result contrary to the conventional wisdom in the area. Counterintuitively, making
    the attacks more costly does not deter them but leads to a less desirable outcome.
    These findings have cautionary implications for the design of crowdsourcing competitions.

    to disaster risk management in the novel scope of risk assessment. We compare
    flood risk assessment profiles produced using data collected by OpenStreetMap
    (OSM) against official geodata produced by local governments in two cities of
    Veneto, Italy. We have found that OSM data present several advantages and have
    a great potential for improvement, suggesting that OSM should be integrated in
    future risk assessment processes.

    Since joining the Open Government Partnership in 2011, the Indonesian Government has shown some commitment towards implementing initiatives that increase citizen voice and government and service-providers’ accountability to citizens and service users. These include a series information and communications technology (ICT)- based complaint-handling systems that give members of the public an opportunity to highlight problems with the delivery of public services to those in a position to fix them. Yet the reach and uptake of these systems – which are both national and local – varies considerably across the country, for a number of reasons.

    This research examines four cases of complaint-handling systems. At the national level, it reviews LAPOR!, a one-stop complaint-handling platform set up by the Indonesian Government to manage citizens’ complaints and requests via SMS, smartphone apps and a website.

    Introduction: People’s online activities can yield clues about their emerging health conditions. We performed an intensive study to explore the feasibility of using anonymized Web query logs to screen for the emergence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The methods used statistical analyses of large-scale anonymized search logs considering the symptom queries from millions of people, with the potential application of warning individual searchers about the value of seeking attention from health care professionals.

    Methods: We identified searchers in logs of online search activity who issued special queries that are suggestive of a recent diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We then went back many months before these landmark queries were made, to examine patterns of symptoms, which were expressed as searches about concerning symptoms. We built statistical classifiers that predicted the future appearance of the landmark queries based on patterns of signals seen in search logs.

    Results: We found that signals about patterns of queries in search logs can predict the future appearance of queries that are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We showed specifically that we can identify 5% to 15% of cases, while preserving extremely low false-positive rates (0.00001 to 0.0001).

    Conclusion: Signals in search logs show the possibilities of predicting a forthcoming diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma from combinations of subtle temporal signals revealed in the queries of searchers.

    The purpose of this report is to learn lessons by looking at the use of internal collaborative tools across the Intelligence Community. The initial rubric was tools, but the real focus is collaboration, for while the tools can enable, what ultimately matters are policies and practices interacting with organizational culture. It looks for good practices to emulate. The ultimate question is how and how much could, and should, collaborative tools foster integration across the Community. The focus is analysis and the analytic process, but collaborative tools can and do serve many other functions in the Intelligence Community—from improving logistics or human resources, to better connecting collection and analysis, to assisting administration and development, to facilitating, as one interlocutor put it, operational “go” decisions. Yet it is in the analytic realm that collaboration is both most visible and most rubs against traditional work processes that are not widely collaborative.

    The report defines terms and discusses concepts, first exploring collaboration and coordination, then defining collaborative tools and social media, then surveying the experience of the private sector. The second section of the report uses those distinctions to sort out the blizzard of collaborative tools that have been created in the various intelligence agencies and across them. The third section outlines the state of collaboration, again both within agencies and across them. The report concludes with findings and recommendations for the Community. The recommendations amount to a continuum of possible actions in making more strategic what is and will continue to be more a bottom-up process of creating and adopting collaborative tools and practices.

    This working paper argues that the growing field of transparency, participation and accountability (TPA) needs a conceptual reboot, to address the limited traction gained so far on the path to accountability. To inform more strategic approaches and to identify the drivers of more sustainable institutional change, fresh analytical work is needed.

    The paper makes the case for one among several possible strategic approaches by distinguishing between 'scaling up' and 'taking scale into account', going on to examine several different ways that ‘scale’ is used in different fields.

  abstract: Though much attention has been given to the relationship between contractor
    and vendor in regard to governmental accountability, little attention has been
    paid to the internal struggles that surface in regard to accountability in the
    procurement process. These informal horizontal relationships often circumvent
    vertical accountability controls most often thought to ensure equitable vendor
    selection. Similarly, though much attention has been paid to political influence
    in contracting, hierarchal organizational structures, and measures of performance,
    the contract officer-program manager relation has not been explored. Specifically,
    the informal tension that often forms between the program manager and contract
    officer has not been examined in regard to such accountability. This paper examines
    the relationship between the program officer and the contract officer in order
    to describe how hybrid public administration can affect the contracting process.

  abstract: Over the past years, an increasing number of studies have looked at the
    use of internet and communications technology (ICT) in the fight against corruption.
    While there is broad agreement that ICT tools can be effective in controlling
    corruption, the mechanisms by which they are doing this are much less clear. This
    paper attempts to shine some light on this relationship. It focuses on the role
    of ICT in empowering citizens and supporting civil society. It argues that enlightened
    citizens can use internet access and social media to inform themselves on corruption,
    mobilize support for anti-corruption movements and gather information in order
    to shine a light on particularistic practices. Defining corruption as a collective
    action problem, the paper provides quantitative evidence to support its claim
    that ICT can support collective action of an informed citizenry and thus contribute
    to the control of corruption.

    The civic technology ecosystem in Latin America is constantly evolving, and the AVINA Foundation-Omidyar Network Civic Innovation Accelerator Fund has proven to be a catalyst for powerful experiences of technological innovation for social change in the region. However, there remains the challenge to determine the real impact created by civic applications. This gives rise to the following question: what are the necessary conditions for civic applications to be a key instrument to reduce the gap between governments and citizens, and thus improve people’s living standards?

    The learnings from the three years since the inception of the Civic Innovation Accelerator Fund, born from an alliance between AVINA Foundation and Omidyar Network, contribute to answering the question regarding the impact and importance of both online (direct platform use) and offline (indirect platform use) actions. Within the framework of an evaluation of the projects supported by the Fund in Latin America, a set of actions were systematized to help balance offline and online actions in civic technology projects, and thus consolidate its role as a tool for social change and increase its potential for impact among citizens.

  abstract: This article builds on work in Science and Technology Studies and cognate
    disciplines concerning the institutionalization of public engagement and participation
    practices. It describes and analyses ethnographic qualitative research into one
    “organization of participation,” the UK government–funded Sciencewise program.
    Sciencewise’s interactions with broader political developments are explored, including
    the emergence of “open policy” as a key policy object in the UK context. The article
    considers what the new imaginary of openness means for institutionalized forms
    of public participation in science policymaking, asking whether this is illustrative
    of a “constitutional moment” in relations between society and science policymaking.

    This report describes a crowdsourced off-road traffic law-making process in Finland, namely idea crowdsourcing for law-reform and idea evaluation. The project was initiated by the Ministry of the Environment of Finland and the Committee for the Future of the Finnish Parliament.

    The project tests crowdsourcing as a method for participatory and direct democracy in an online context. The project goal is to identify ways in which citizens can participate in policy-making online in a meaningful fashion. The goal is also to gather information about such processes, to create knowledge of them, and to share that knowledge for the improvement of governance. Methods for direct and participatory democracy in the recent years have raised much interest both among policy-makers and academics, yet there remains a lack of knowledge and, in particular, empirical evidence about these methods. We hope that our work will contribute to filling that gap.

  abstract: "Science-intensive firms are experimenting with ‘open data’ initiatives,
    involving collaboration with academic scientists whereby all results are published
    with no restriction. Firms seeking to benefit from open data face two key challenges:
    revealing R&D problems may leak valuable information to competitors, and academic
    scientists may lack motivation to address problems posed by firms. We explore
    how firms overcome these challenges through an inductive study of the Structural
    Genomics Consortium. We find that the operation of the consortium as a boundary
    organization provided two core mechanisms to address the above challenges. First,
    through mediated revealing, the boundary organization allowed firms to disclose
    R&D problems while minimizing adverse competitive consequences. Second, by enabling
    multiple goals the boundary organization increased the attractiveness of industry-informed
    agendas for academic scientists. We work our results into a grounded model of
    boundary organizations as a vehicle for open data initiatives. Our study contributes
    to research on public–private research partnerships, knowledge revealing and boundary
    organizations.\n\n"

  abstract: In 2012, fewer people were reported to have died or been affected as a
    result of disasters than any other year during the previous decade, according
    to figures presented in this report. While these numbers are positive news, they
    also reflect the absence of major events like the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Cyclone
    Nargis in Myanmar in 2008 or the 2010 Haiti earthquake. We have learned from these
    major disasters. At the same time we must continue to improve and innovate to
    make disaster preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery more effective and
    accountable. With these objectives in mind, this year’s World Disasters Report
    focuses on the rapid spread of technologies, especially information and communication
    technologies, which is changing humanitarian action and humanitarians, too.

  abstract: 'Transparency’s importance as an administrative norm seems self-evident.
    Prevailing ideals of political theory stipulate that the more visible government
    is, the more democratic, accountable, and legitimate it appears. The disclosure
    of state information consistently disappoints, however: there is never enough
    of it, while it often seems not to produce a truer democracy, a more accountable
    state, better policies, and a more contented populace. This gap between theory
    and practice suggests that the theoretical assumptions that provide the basis
    for transparency are wrong. This article argues that transparency is best understood
    as a theory of communication that excessively simplifies and thus is blind to
    the complexities of the contemporary state, government information, and the public.
    Taking them fully into account, the article argues, should lead us to question
    the state’s ability to control information, which in turn should make us question
    not only the improbability of the state making itself visible, but also the improbability
    of the state keeping itself secret.'

  abstract: Spatial technologies and the organizations around them, such as the Standby
    Task Force and Ushahidi, are increasingly changing the ways crises and emergencies
    are addressed. Within digital humanitarianism, Big Data has featured strongly
    in recent efforts to improve digital humanitarian work. This shift toward social
    media and other Big Data sources has entailed unexamined assumptions about technological
    progress, social change, and the kinds of knowledge captured by data. These assumptions
    stand in tension with critical geographic scholarship, and in particular critical
    GIS research. In this paper I borrow from critical research on technologies to
    engage three important new facets of Big Data emerging from an interrogation of
    digital humanitarianism. I argue first that within digital humanitarianism, Big
    Data should be understood as a new set of practices, in addition to its usual
    conception as data and analytics technologies. Second, I argue that Big Data constitutes
    a distinct epistemology that obscures many forms of knowledge in crises and emergencies
    and produces a limited understanding of how a crisis is unfolding. Third, I argue
    that Big Data is constitutive of a social relation in which both the formal humanitarian
    sector and “victims” of crises are in need of the services and labor that can
    be provided by digital humanitarians.

  abstract: 'Policy makers can use four different modes of governance: ‘hierarchy’,
    ‘markets’, ‘networks’ and ‘persuasion’. In this article, it is argued that ‘nudging’
    represents a distinct (fifth) mode of governance. The effectiveness of nudging
    as a means of bringing about lasting behaviour change is questioned and it is
    argued that evidence for its success ignores the facts that many successful nudges
    are not in fact nudges; that there are instances when nudges backfire; and that
    there may be ethical concerns associated with nudges. Instead, and in contrast
    to nudging, behaviour change is more likely to be enduring where it involves social
    identity change and norm internalisation. The article concludes by urging public
    policy scholars to engage with the social identity literature on ‘social influence’,
    and the idea that those promoting lasting behaviour change need to engage with
    people not as individual cognitive misers, but as members of groups whose norms
    they internalise and enact.'

    Edwin Hutchins combines his background as an anthropologist and an open ocean racing sailor and navigator in this account of how anthropological methods can be combined with cognitive theory to produce a new reading of cognitive science. His theoretical insights are grounded in an extended analysis of ship navigation—its computational basis, its historical roots, its social organization, and the details of its implementation in actual practice aboard large ships. The result is an unusual interdisciplinary approach to cognition in culturally constituted activities outside the laboratory—"in the wild."

    Hutchins examines a set of phenomena that have fallen in the cracks between the established disciplines of psychology and anthropology, bringing to light a new set of relationships between culture and cognition. The standard view is that culture affects the cognition of individuals. Hutchins argues instead that cultural activity systems have cognitive properties of their own that are different from the cognitive properties of the individuals who participate in them. Each action for bringing a large naval vessel into port, for example, is informed by culture: the navigation team can be seen as a cognitive and computational system.

    Introducing Navy life and work on the bridge, Hutchins makes a clear distinction between the cognitive properties of an individual and the cognitive properties of a system. In striking contrast to the usual laboratory tasks of research in cognitive science, he applies the principal metaphor of cognitive science—cognition as computation (adopting David Marr's paradigm)—to the navigation task. After comparing modern Western navigation with the method practiced in Micronesia, Hutchins explores the computational and cognitive properties of systems that are larger than an individual. He then turns to an analysis of learning or change in the organization of cognitive systems at several scales. Hutchins's conclusion illustrates the costs of ignoring the cultural nature of cognition, pointing to the ways in which contemporary cognitive science can be transformed by new meanings and interpretations.

  abstract: 'This article takes stock of the growing field of online deliberation
    research. Our review of the theoretical and empirical findings is guided by a
    framework encompassing the three relevant components of deliberation: the institutional
    design that enables and fosters deliberation (institutional input: “design”),
    the quality of the communication process (communicative throughput: “process”),
    and the expected results of deliberation (productive outcome: “results”). Our
    findings show that scholarly attention is unevenly distributed across the different
    components of the framework. Most research has focused on the quality of the online
    discussion (process). A fair amount of research has focused on the institutional
    conditions fostering deliberation (design), while the outcomes of online deliberation
    processes (results) have mostly been neglected. This picture is repeated in terms
    of the causal relations between design, process, and results of deliberation:
    Most studies have dealt with the effects of the platform design on the degree
    of deliberation (design-process). Much less is known about how the process of
    deliberation shapes the outcomes of deliberation (process-results). Studies investigating
    all three aspects of deliberation and their causal links (design-process-results)
    are particularly rare.'

  abstract: Technology and transparency combined to create the digital revolution,
    which in turn has ushered in a new form o f monitory democracy. Communicative
    abundance and global interconnection mean the democratic franchise can expand
    and deepen, but the author argues that it matters who is made transparent and
    for what purpose. Content and context matter. Technology and transparency can
    be used to strengthen democracy by opening up government to citizens, but the
    same tools can also be used by the state to surveil and disempower citizens, thereby
    damaging democracy. The author uses three case studies to discuss the impact o
    f digitizing information on power relations between citizens and states. First,
    her observations as the journalist and litigant in the legal case that forced
    the digitization o f UK parliamentary expense records, which when leaked created
    one o f the biggest political scandals in that country for decades. Second, she
    obtained the entire set o f U. S. diplomatic cables and reported on their contents
    for the Guardian. Lastly, she served as a member o f the Independent Surveillance
    Review Panel, set up by the UK government to investigate allegations made by Edward
    Snowden that the UK and U.S. governments were conducting mass surveillance programs
    that were potentially illegal and lacked adequate oversight. The case studies
    show how journalism is integral not only to identifying useful civic information
    but also maximizing the public good from leaked information while minimizing harm.

  abstract: Smart cities are associated almost exclusively with modern technology
    and infrastructure. However, smart cities have the possibility to enhance the
    involvement and contribution of citizens to urban development. This work explores
    the role of governance as one of the factors influencing the participation of
    citizens in smart cities projects. Governance characteristics play a major role
    in explaining different typologies of citizen participation. Through a focus on
    Amsterdam Smart City program as a specific case study, this research examines
    the characteristics of governance that are present in the overall program and
    within a selected sample of projects, and how they relate to different typologies
    of citizen participation. The analysis and comprehension of governance characteristics
    plays a crucial role both for a better understanding and management of citizen
    participation, especially in complex settings where multiple actors are interacting.

  abstract: 'Arguably the most important decision at an arraignment is whether to
    release an offender until the date of his or her next scheduled court appearance.
    Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, threats to public safety can be a key factor
    in that decision. Implicitly, a forecast of “future dangerousness” is required.
    In this article, we consider in particular whether usefully accurate forecasts
    of domestic violence can be obtained. We apply machine learning to data on over
    28,000 arraignment cases from a major metropolitan area in which an offender faces
    domestic violence charges. One of three possible post-arraignment outcomes is
    forecasted within two years: (1) a domestic violence arrest associated with a
    physical injury, (2) a domestic violence arrest not associated with a physical
    injury, and (3) no arrests for domestic violence. We incorporate asymmetric costs
    for different kinds of forecasting errors so that very strong statistical evidence
    is required before an offender is forecasted to be a good risk. When an out-of-sample
    forecast of no post-arraignment domestic violence arrests within two years is
    made, it is correct about 90 percent of the time. Under current practice within
    the jurisdiction studied, approximately 20 percent of those released after an
    arraignment for domestic violence are arrested within two years for a new domestic
    violence offense. If magistrates used the methods we have developed and released
    only offenders forecasted not to be arrested for domestic violence within two
    years after an arraignment, as few as 10 percent might be arrested. The failure
    rate could be cut nearly in half. Over a typical 24-month period in the jurisdiction
    studied, well over 2,000 post-arraignment arrests for domestic violence perhaps
    could be averted.'

    In citizen-led accountability initiatives, we understand much more about how citizens mobilise around accountability demands than we do about what leads state agents to respond to them. This report highlights some key themes that are important in exploring the state side of the accountability equation.

    The insights shared here emerged from a workshop which brought together researchers, policy specialists and practitioners working in the field of accountable governance.

  abstract: Publishing structured datasets openly, called "open data" is gaining momentum
    worldwide. Government of India has started an open data initiative with the launch
    of its own portal. In addition, open data in India is also published by private
    firms, research institutes and NGOs (Non - Governmental Organizations). Although
    structured, the datasets do not comply to any a priori defined schema and semantic
    elements are fragmented across the disparate datasets. We are working on a project
    in which we aim to semantically aggregate Indian open data. This will help users
    to browse open data related to an entity and get a one stop entry to all the aspects
    of that entity. In this paper we discuss a survey conducted as part of this project
    to get a fair idea of the open data scene in India. This survey helped us to categorize
    the open data which makes the modeling easier.

  abstract: "Elected mayors should be required to set up an Office of Data Analytics
    comprising of small, expert teams tasked with using public and privately held
    data to create smarter and more productive cities. \n\nA new paper, Smart Devolution,
    by leading think tank Policy Exchange says that most cities have vast quantities
    of data that if accessed and used effectively could help improve public services,
    optimise transport routes, support the growth of small businesses and even prevent
    cycling accidents.  \n\nThe report highlights how every UK city should use the
    additional powers they receive from Whitehall to replicate New York by employing
    a small team of data experts to collect and collate information from a range of
    sources, including councils, emergency services, voluntary organisations, mobile
    phone networks and payment systems.\n\nThe data teams will provide city mayors
    with a great opportunity to break down the silos that exist between local authorities
    and public sector bodies when it comes to unlocking information that could save
    money and improve the standard of living for the public. "

    This Report provides tools and guidance to the City of Seattle and other municipalities navigating the complex policy, operational, technical, organizational, and ethical standards that support privacy protective open data programs. Although there is a growing body of research regarding open data privacy, open data managers and departmental data owners need to be able to employ a standardized
    methodology for assessing the privacy risks and benefits of particular datasets internally, without access to a bevy of expert statisticians, privacy lawyers, or philosophers. By optimizing its internal processes and procedures, developing and investing in advanced statistical disclosure control strategies, and following a flexible, risk-based assessment process, the City of Seattle – and other municipalities – can build mature open data programs that maximize the utility and openness of civic data while minimizing privacy risks to individuals and addressing community concerns about ethical challenges, fairness, and equity.

  abstract: 'Social media are being increasingly used for health promotion, yet the
    landscape of users, messages and interactions in such fora is poorly understood.
    Studies of social media and diabetes have focused mostly on patients, or public
    agencies addressing it, but have not looked broadly at all the participants or
    the diversity of content they contribute. We study Twitter conversations about
    diabetes through the systematic analysis of 2.5 million tweets collected over
    8 months and the interactions between their authors. We address three questions:
    (1) what themes arise in these tweets?; (2) who are the most influential users?;
    (3) which type of users contribute to which themes? We answer these questions
    using a mixed-methods approach, integrating techniques from anthropology, network
    science and information retrieval such as thematic coding, temporal network analysis,
    and community and topic detection. Diabetes-related tweets fall within broad thematic
    groups: health information, news, social interaction, and commercial. At the same
    time, humorous messages and references to popular culture appear consistently,
    more than any other type of tweet. We classify authors according to their temporal
    ''hub'' and ''authority'' scores. Whereas the hub landscape is diffuse and fluid
    over time, top authorities are highly persistent across time and comprise bloggers,
    advocacy groups and NGOs related to diabetes, as well as for-profit entities without
    specific diabetes expertise. Top authorities fall into seven interest communities
    as derived from their Twitter follower network. Our findings have implications
    for public health professionals and policy makers who seek to use social media
    as an engagement tool and to inform policy design.'

  abstract: This meta-analytic study reviews empirical research published from 2007
    to 2013 with an aim of providing robust conclusions about the relationship between
    social media use and citizen engagement. It includes 22 studies that used self-reported
    measures of social media use and participation, with a total of 116 relationships/effects.
    The results suggest that social media use generally has a positive relationship
    with engagement and its three sub-categories, that is, social capital, civic engagement,
    and political participation. More specifically, we find small-to-medium size positive
    relationships between expressive, informational, and relational uses of social
    media and the above indicators of citizen engagement. For identity- and entertainment-oriented
    uses of social media, our analyses find little evidence supporting their relationship
    with citizen engagement.

  abstract: "This volume provides the most current research on smart cities. Specifically,
    it focuses on the economic development and sustainability of smart cities and
    examines how to transform older industrial cities into sustainable smart cities.
    It aims to identify the role of the following elements in the creation and management
    of smart cities:• Citizen participation and empowerment • Value creation mechanisms
    • Public administration• Quality of life and sustainability• Democracy• ICT• Private
    initiatives and entrepreneurship\n Regardless of their size, all cities are ultimately
    agglomerations of people and institutions. Agglomeration economies make it possible
    to attain minimum efficiencies of scale in the organization and delivery of services.
    However, the economic benefits do not constitute the main advantage of a city.
    A city’s status rests on three dimensions: (1) political impetus, which is the
    result of citizens’ participation and the public administration’s agenda; (2)
    applications derived from technological advances (especially in ICT); and (3)
    cooperation between public and private initiatives in business development and
    entrepreneurship. These three dimensions determine which resources are necessary
    to create smart cities. But a smart city, ideal in the way it channels and resolves
    technological, social and economic-growth issues, requires many additional elements
    to function at a high-performance level, such as culture (an environment that
    empowers and engages citizens) and physical infrastructure designed to foster
    competition and collaboration, encourage new ideas and actions, and set the stage
    for new business creation. \n Featuring contributions with models, tools and cases
    from around the world, this book will be a valuable resource for researchers,
    students, academics, professionals and policymakers interested in smart cities."

  abstract: 'Digital credit products are characterized by a lending process that is
    instantaneous, automated, and remote. While digital credit has the potential to
    reach less collateralized, less mobile, and more remote cohorts of borrowers,
    there are also risks in relying on digital credit for financial inclusion. This
    paper investigates the digital credit policy environment and the extent to which
    it may support pro-poor digital credit market development using two types of documents:
    a set of 23 regulatory documents specifically mentioning either digital or online
    credit or lending, and another set of 298 informal documents relevant to digital
    credit based on a systematic web search. After reviewing the literature on the
    effects of credit expansion and automated credit scoring, we summarize the characteristics
    of the current digital credit regulatory environment in low- and middle-income
    countries. Our findings suggest that few regulations specifically target digital
    credit markets, and that the current regulatory environment may not support the
    full potential of digital credit to reach historically underserved credit consumers.
    Most countries do not explicitly target financial inclusion as part of their digital
    credit policies. However, we do find evidence that informal web documents consider
    financial inclusion to a greater extent than formal regulatory documents. '

  abstract: "Business systems undergo a number of transitions as the needs and demands
    of society change. With heightened connectivity driven by the development of the
    Internet, new opportunities for venture development and creation have become available
    to business owners and entrepreneurs.\n \n Crowdfunding for Sustainable Entrepreneurship
    and Innovation is a pivotal reference source for the latest scholarly research
    and business practices on the opportunities and benefits gained from the use of
    crowdfunding in modern society, discussing its socio-economic impact, in addition
    to its business implications. Featuring current trends and future directions for
    crowdfunding initiatives, this book is ideally designed for students, researchers,
    practitioners, entrepreneurs, and policy makers.\n \n New financing models such
    as crowdfunding are democratizing access to credit, offering individuals and communities
    the opportunity to support, co-create, contribute and invest in public and private
    initiatives. This book relates to innovation in its essence to anticipate future
    needs and in creating new business models without losing revenue. There are tremendous
    unexplored opportunities in crowdsourcing and crowdfunding; two sides of the same
    coin that can lead to a revolution of current social and economic models. The
    reading of this book will provide insight on the changes taking place in crowdfunding,
    and offer strategic opportunities and advantages."

  abstract: |-
    Yayasan Kota Kita (Our City Foundation) is an organisation of governance practitioners who focus on urban planning and citizen participation in the design and development of cities. Following several years of experience with participatory budgeting in Solo city, their research set out to examine participatory budgeting processes in six Indonesian cities, to inform their work – and the work of others – strengthening citizen participation in urban governance. Their research looked at:
    - the current status of participatory budgeting in six Indonesian cities
    - the barriers and enablers to implementing participatory budgeting
    - how government and CSOs can help make participatory budgeting more transparent, inclusive and impactful.

    This practice paper describes Kota Kita and its work in more detail, and reflects on the history and evolution of participatory budgeting in Indonesia. In doing so, it contextualises some of the findings of the research, and discusses their implications.

  abstract: Crowdsourcing legislation gives ordinary citizens, rather than political
    and bureaucratic elites, the chance to cooperate to come up with innovative new
    policies. By increasing popular involvement, representative democracies hope to
    restock dwindling reserves of political legitimacy. However, it is still not clear
    how involvement in legislative decision making affects the attitudes of the participants.
    It is therefore of central concern to establish whether crowdsourcing can actually
    help restore political legitimacy by creating more positive attitudes toward the
    political system. This article contributes to this research agenda by examining
    the developments in attitudes among the users on the Finnish website Avoin Ministeriö
    (“Open Ministry”) which orchestrates crowdsourcing of legislation by providing
    online tools for deliberating ideas for citizens' initiatives. The developments
    in attitudes are investigated with a two-stage survey of 421 respondents who answered
    questions concerning political and social attitudes, as well as political activities
    performed. The results suggest that while crowdsourcing legislation has so far
    not affected political legitimacy in a positive manner, it has the potential to
    do so.

    Much of the literature on citizen accountability focuses on citizen voices. This research briefing is one of four which turn the spotlight on the how the state behaves in instances of accountable governance. Each examines a landmark social justice policy process in Africa, asking when and how the state listened, and to which actors; and why, at times, it chose not to listen.

    South Africa’s welfare policy was reformed in 1997, establishing a grants system that today covers 16 million recipients. This process was driven by ‘policy champions’ – individuals who nurture a policy for years, waiting for an opportunity to suggest it as the solution to a pressing problem (Kingdon 2002). But once these champions moved on – taking with them their expertise, networking abilities and persistence – the key advocates for implementing the reforms were lost.

    To achieve our vision of digital equality, we need to understand how new technologies are shaping society; where they present opportunities to make people's lives better, and indeed where they threaten to create harm. To this end, we have commisioned a series of white papers examining three key digital trends: artificial intelligence, algorithms, and control of personal data. The papers focus on low- and middle-income countries, which are all too often overlooked in debates around the impacts of emerging technologies.

    The series addresses each of these three digital issues, looking at how they are impacting people's lives and identifying steps that governments, companies and civil society organizations can take to limit the harms, and maximize benefits, for citizens.

    We will use these white papers to refine our thinking and set our work agenda on digital equality in the years ahead. We are sharing them openly with the hope they benefit others working towards our goal and to amplify the limited research currently available on digital issues in low- and middle-income countries. We intend the papers to foster discussion about the steps we can take together to ensure emerging technologies are used in ways that benefit people's lives, whether they are in Los Angeles or Lagos.

    The vision, design and implementation of e-governance in India with its attendant “datafication” leads to many pertinent questions about the changing nature of governance and state-citizen engagement. This Brief argues that data-based decision-making in India is part of a larger trend that seems to displace the complex ingredients of participatory governance - dialogue, deliberation, audit and answerability - in favour of a fait accompli that disempowers citizens. Whether it is biometric based authentication systems, online grievance mechanisms or Big Data based beneficiary rationalisation, the absence of modes for a meaningful right to be heard, right to contest and seek accountability, decouple citizenship from rights and justice.

    The authors include a case study on "Rajasthan Sampark", a grievance redressal portal of the state government of Rajasthan to manage citizen grievances across multiple departments and administrative branches.  They use the study to argue that to be meaningful for local accountability, citizen-centricism needs to be a key design feature of e-governance platforms.

    When it comes to ICT-mediated governance participation in Brazil, Internet penetration still remains a major challenge, with only around half of homes having connectivity. Opportunities to influence public policy frameworks and government strategies through the Internet, or even through offline interaction, are limited. A worsening of the political and economic situation, and the lack of strong institutionalisation of direct participation have contributed to the decline of participation initiatives in Brazil.

    This Brief offers a case study of two public consultations initiated by the government to understand the impact of citizen participation through technology on governance in Brazil. The construction of Internet-related policies occurred on a digital platform, made available online in both consultations, specifically:
    - Marco Civil da Internet - a platform for a public consultation about a draft bill on Internet users’ rights, where the Bill was subsequently approved by the Brazilian Congress
    - Copyright Reform bill proposed by the Ministry of Culture. The bill resulting from the public consultation on Copyright Reform was never taken to Congress.

    wanted to know how collective order can be built and maintained: governing implies
    knowledge about the world to be governed and the resources available to do so,
    and about the interests and dispositions of the actors involved. What is more,
    while knowing governance has always been key to ruling effectively, it is at the
    same time a principal lever for those who seek to challenge authority. Shared
    knowledge is a precondition of collective action and of the imagined communities
    of modern politics, whether nations or social movements or issue-based constituencies.'

  abstract: |-
    This edited volume is devoted to Big Data Analysis from a Machine Learning standpoint as presented by some of the most eminent researchers in this area.

    It demonstrates that Big Data Analysis opens up new research problems which were either never considered before, or were only considered within a limited range. In addition to providing methodological discussions on the principles of mining Big Data and the difference between traditional statistical data analysis and newer computing frameworks, this book presents recently developed algorithms affecting such areas as business, financial forecasting, human mobility, the Internet of Things, information networks, bioinformatics, medical systems and life science. It explores, through a number of specific examples, how the study of Big Data Analysis has evolved and how it has started and will most likely continue to affect society. While the benefits brought upon by Big Data Analysis are underlined, the book also discusses some of the warnings that have been issued concerning the potential dangers of Big Data Analysis along with its pitfalls and challenges.

  abstract: As the second phase of the Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing
    Countries (ODDC) drew to a close, discussions started on a possible venue for
    publishing some of the papers that emerged from the research conducted by the
    project partners. In 2012 the Journal of Community Informatics published a special
    issue titled ‘Community Informatics and Open Government Data’. Given the journal’s
    previous interest in the field of open data, its established reputation and the
    fact that it is a peer-reviewed open access journal, the Journal of Community
    Informatics was approached and agreed to a second special issue with a focus on
    open data. A closed call for papers was sent out to the project research partners.
    Shortly afterwards, the first Open Data Research Symposium was held ahead of the
    International Open Data Conference 2015 in Ottawa, Canada. For the first time,
    a forum was provided to academics and researchers to present papers specifically
    on open data. Again there were discussions about an appropriate venue to publish
    selected papers from the Symposium. The decision was taken by the Symposium Programme
    Committee to invite the twenty plus presenters to submit full papers for consideration
    in the special issue. The seven papers published in this special issue are those
    that were selected through a double-blind peer review process.

  abstract: Political leaders and civic advocates are increasingly recommending that
    open access be the “default state” for much of the information held by government
    agencies. Over the past several years, they have driven the launch of open data
    initiatives across hundreds of national, state, and local governments. These initiatives
    are founded on a presumption of openness for government data and have led to the
    public release of large quantities data through a variety of channels. At the
    same time, much of the data that have been released, or are being considered for
    release, pertain to the behavior and characteristics of individual citizens, highlighting
    tensions between open data and privacy. This research briefing offers a snapshot
    of recent developments in the open data and privacy landscape, outlines an action
    map of various governance approaches to protecting privacy when releasing open
    data, and identifies key opportunities for decision-makers seeking to respond
    to challenges in this space.

  abstract: 'This article considers online participation in higher education decision-making
    using the MyUniversity EU project as a case study. MyUniversity was a pilot designed
    to provide European universities with a web-based system to empower and involve
    students and other members of the academic community in the Bologna Process. Thirteen
    universities in Spain, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Lithuania participated in trials.
    The study uses data collection methods from across the quantitative and qualitative
    spectrum: web analytics, online surveys, key performance indicators, interviews,
    focus groups, participant observation, document studies, and usability evaluations.
    The results are represented by 10 themes: project design, participation, functionality
    and usability, impact on decision-making, privacy and trust, institutional resistance,
    motivational factors, the political, economic, and sociocultural context, language
    barriers, and moderation and framing. The article ends with a discussion based
    on the results, including recommendations for future research.'

  abstract: |-
    A new generation of strategies for government accountability is needed, one that fully considers entrenched, institutional obstacles to change. Vertical integration of coordinated civil society policy monitoring and advocacy is one such strategy. Engaging each stage and level of public sector actions in an integrated way can locate the causes of accountability failures, show their interconnected nature, and leverage the local, national and transnational power shifts necessary to produce sustainable institutional change.

    This case study summary is one of seven that reflect on civil society monitoring and advocacy initiatives in the Philippines – all of which aim to improve government accountability in different sectors – through the lens of vertical integration.

    In the 1990s, widespread demolitions displaced many informal settlers in Metro Manila. Victims and their families responded by organising themselves. Among those that organised early was the umbrella organisation Damayan ng Maralitang Pilipinong Api (Philippines Poverty Relief, DAMPA). Created to demand not housing and relocation from different levels of government, and the social services that should go with them, DAMPA organised poor communities around common basic issues through building a partnership with the government, enhancing community-based self-help initiatives, and initiating pro-poor legislation at both the local and national government levels.

  abstract: "Respect for privacy and the individual’s right to control their own data
    is becoming a key competitive parameter. Companies, organisations and authorities
    that treat data ethics as a social responsibility as important as environmental
    awareness and respect for human rights are tomorrow’s winners. Digital trust is
    paramount for digital growth and welfare.\n \n This book combines broad trend
    analysis with case studies of companies working with data ethics to varying degrees.
    The authors make the case how citizens and consumers are no longer just concerned
    about their lack of control over data, but also have begun to act, and how alternative
    business models, advances in technology and a new European data protection regulation
    combined foster a growing market for data ethical products and services. It provides
    a critical and fresh look at tech trends and the ethical dilemmas intertwined
    with them. It is a book for responsible players on how to get started with data
    ethics and how to use it to develop digital trust."

  abstract: 'We present theoretical and empirical results demon- strating the usefulness
    of social choice functions in crowdsourcing for participatory democracies. First,
    we demonstrate the scalability of social choice functions by defining a natural
    notion of ✏-approximation, and giving algorithms which efficiently elicit such
    approximations for two prominent social choice functions: the Borda rule and the
    Condorcet winner. This result circumvents previous prohibitive lower bounds and
    is surprisingly strong: even if the number of ideas is as large as the number
    of participants, each participant will only have to make a logarithmic number
    of comparisons, an expo- nential improvement over the linear number of compar-
    isons previously needed. Second, we apply these ideas to Finland’s recent off-road
    traffic law reform, an ex- periment on participatory democracy in real life. This
    allows us to verify the scaling predicted in our theory and show that the constant
    involved is also not large. In addition, by collecting data on the time that users
    take to complete rankings of varying sizes, we observe that eliciting partial
    rankings can further decrease elicitation time as compared to the common method
    of eliciting pairwise comparisons.'

  abstract: 'While national and local governments increasingly deploy crowdsourcing
    in lawmaking as an open government practice, it remains unclear how crowdsourcing
    creates value when it is applied in policymaking. Therefore, in this article,
    we examine value creation in crowdsourcing for public policymaking. We introduce
    a framework for analysing value creation in public policymaking in the following
    three dimensions: democratic, epistemic and economic. Democratic value is created
    by increasing transparency, accountability, inclusiveness and deliberation in
    crowdsourced policymaking. Epistemic value is developed when crowdsourcing serves
    as a knowledge search mechanism and a learning context. Economic value is created
    when crowdsourcing makes knowledge search in policymaking more efficient and enables
    government to produce policies that better address citizens’ needs and societal
    issues. We show how these tenets of value creation are manifest in crowdsourced
    policymaking by drawing on instances of crowdsourced lawmaking, and we also discuss
    the contingencies and challenges preventing value creation.'

  abstract: |-
    Participatory budgeting programmes are spreading rapidly across the world because they offer government officials and citizens the opportunity to engage each other in new ways as they combine democratic practices with the ‘nitty gritty’ of policy-making. The principles and ideas associated with participatory budgeting appeal to a broad spectrum of citizens, civil society activists, government officials and international agencies, which helps explain why it is so popular and has expanded so quickly.

    This research briefing looks at how participatory budgeting is transforming in countries where international donors are active, where states struggle to provide public services, and where urban and rural communities are characterised by high levels of poverty. A workshop, held in Kenya, July 2017, brought together professionals from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) affiliated with the Making All Voices Count research programme, based in Indonesia, Kenya, Mozambique, the Philippines, Senegal, South Africa and Uganda.

  abstract: |-
    This volume discusses the importance of adopting entrepreneurial and innovation practices in the public sector, as mechanisms for detecting, dealing with and including citizens’ social needs, with a reflection on positive determination of their quality of life. It focuses on critical reflection and rethinking the articulation between the dimensions of transformation – entrepreneurship and innovation – of New Public Management (NPM). In this way the book contributes to deepening knowledge about the implications of this change in the organizational paradigm of the public sector for citizens’ quality of life, which is treated multi-dimensionally here, including citizens’ well-being, purchasing power, happiness, trust, safety, experience and satisfaction.
     The volume constitutes a reference guide for decision makers, managers and policy makers engaged in the public sector who want to differentiate their performance by fostering entrepreneurial and innovative practices in the scope of public administration that can enhance citizens’ quality of life. This volume is also a reference guide for scholars, policy makers and practitioners interested on public innovation.

  abstract: Government legislation and calls for greater levels of oversight and transparency
    are leading public bodies to publish their raw datasets online. Policy makers
    and elected officials anticipate that the accessibility of open data through online
    Government portals for citizens will enable public engagement in policy making
    through increased levels of fact based content elicited from open data. The usability
    and benefits of such open data are being argued as contributing positively towards
    public sector reforms, which are under extreme pressures driven by extended periods
    of austerity. However, there is very limited scholarly studies that have attempted
    to empirically evaluate the performance of government open data websites and the
    acceptance and use of these data from a citizen perspective. Given this research
    void, an adjusted diffusion of innovation model based on Rogers’ diffusion of
    innovations theory (DOI) is proposed and used in this paper to empirically determine
    the predictors influencing the use of public sector open data. A good understanding
    of these predictors affecting the acceptance and use of open data will likely
    assist policy makers and public administrations in determining the policy instruments
    that can increase the acceptance and use of open data through an active promotion
    campaign to engage-contribute-use.

    powerful ‘platform’ also involving external innovators. However, the typical information
    system of a public agency is not open by design. Several public administrations
    have started adopting technical solutions to overcome this issue, typically in
    the form of middleware layers operating as ‘buses’ between data centres and the
    outside world. Open-DAI is an open source platform designed to expose data as
    services, directly pulling from legacy databases of the data holder. The platform
    is the result of an ongoing project funded under the EU ICT PSP call 2011. We
    present the rationale and features of Open-DAI, also through a comparison with
    three other open data platforms: the Socrata Open Data portal, CKAN, and ENGAGE.'

  abstract: |-
    The Netherlands provides several avenues for citizen participation in formal policy-making, and is often described as a global leader in e-participation and e-government. Yet, even in a context where citizen participation has become a policy principle, the desired format of and the actual opportunities for participation can be problematic.

    The Dutch case raises awareness on four pitfalls:
    - the appropriation of citizen participation as a means to legitimise cuts to public services
    - the development of a limited (and limiting) vision of participation
    - the difficulty of a systematic review of the landscape of participation opportunities
    - and the limited approach to the role of ICTs in policy-making.

    This Brief seeks to understand what lessons can be learned from the integration of ICTs in the governance process in the Netherlands. In particular, it looks at the visions and opportunities for citizen engagement opened up by the use of digital technologies in governance processes. This research presents the top-down visions and opportunities for citizen engagement, comparing them to those emerging organically out of a specific case of grassroots digital activism - Ons Geld (Our Money).

  abstract: Citizen participation is a cornerstone of urban planning. One common criticism
    is that the process can be cumbersome and slow. However, in the face of recent
    advances in information and communication technologies (ICT), those problems can
    be easily overcome, making it possible to extend public participation to a wider
    sphere of urban planning matters. But what do we know of how ICT-based public
    participation affects urban form? What does a city shaped by social networks and
    other ICT-tools look like? We develop an agent-based model of urban growth to
    improve our understanding of these issues. Our model consists of a spatially disaggregated,
    micro-economic-based, real estate market model coupled with an ICT-based planning

    and preferences over the height of buildings.

  abstract: 'This paper aims to explore the materiality of algorithmic governance
    by looking at the political, social and bureaucratic negotiations that building
    an information system entails. Through a study of the Crime and Criminal Tracking
    System in India (CCTNS), it will look at the failure of smart policing in India
    as a complex mix of politics, bureaucratic inefficiency and social norms.   The
    paper is based on Bowker and Star’s (1999) study of infrastructures where they
    have argued that physical, political and bureaucratic infrastructures are invisible
    but intrinsic to the making of any classification system. Their concept of “Infrastructure
    inversion” which means, “recognising the depths of interdependence of technical
    networks and standards (in the making of infrastructures), on the one hand, and
    the real work of politics and knowledge production on the other” (ibid: 34) is
    a methodological tool to analyse infrastructures and their formation from a social,
    political and economic lens.  This paper will take CCTNS as a large-scale information
    infrastructure and study its underlying political, social and bureaucratic infrastructures
    to understand how they contribute to the failure of smart policing in India. The
    assumption being that it is not just physical construction of systems but negotiating
    with the social, bureaucratic and the political that impact the setting up of
    a digital system. This paper is part of an ongoing project to study digital crime
    record keeping and data analysis in India and currently deals with only New Delhi,
    capital city of India. However, the condition of CCTNS implementation in New Delhi
    is indicative of its implementation in the rest of the country.'

  abstract: This scoping study is a first step in the Joined-Up Data process. It suggests
    possible terms for the conversation around building blocks, highlights first steps
    that initiatives can take towards collaboration, and identifies questions to be
    addressed in future studies. The study explores the standardised disclosure requirements
    of five multi-stakeholder transparency initiatives (International Aid Transparency
    Initiative, Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative, Construction Sector
    Transparency Initiative, Global Initiative for Fiscal Transparency, and Open Contracting)
    in search of potential areas for collaboration. It outlines the governance processes
    underlying the creation of these requirements to make clear where this collaborative
    development can take place.

  abstract: To address the complex and crosscutting challenges facing the federal
    government, agencies need to effectively engage and collaborate with those in
    the private, nonprofit, and academic sectors, other levels of government, and
    citizens. Agencies are increasingly using open innovation strategies for these
    purposes. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) requires federal agencies
    to identify strategies and resources they will use to achieve their goals. GPRAMA
    also requires GAO to periodically review how implementation of its requirements
    is affecting agency performance. This report identifies and illustrates practices
    that help agencies effectively implement open innovation strategies, and how the
    use of those strategies has affected agency performance and opportunities for
    citizen engagement. To identify these practices, GAO analyzed relevant federal
    guidance and academic literature, and interviewed open innovation experts. To
    refine and illustrate the practices, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials
    from the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Science and Technology Policy,
    General Services Administration, and six selected federal agencies. GAO selected
    the agencies and a sample of their initiatives based on several factors, including
    the number and type of initiatives outlined in their Open Government Plans.

    Research in South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda shows that, at best, ICTs can support
    relationship building, but that they are not a substitute for the human element
    that is essential to creating trust, dialogue and shared goals.

    A significant body of evidence points to a strong relationship between those who are economically, socially and/or politically marginalised, and those who are marginalised in their access to, and use of, ICTs. The main purpose of this report is to explore and understand the role of the mobile phone in the lives of the less connected in South Africa. The less connected, as identified for this report are those who, if they use the Internet at all, use it mainly or only on their mobile phones; whose home languages are under-represented online; and who largely depend on mobile operator networks for their connectivity, since they do not have fixed-line connections at home.

    Research sought to explore what kind of experiences of being connected these people have, and what role the mobile phone plays in their everyday lives. To do this, the authors developed a new diary interview method to construct the mobile diaries of more than 80 people in three locations in urban and rural South Africa. The diaries are based on mobile activities on the day before the interviews of the users took place, or 'yesterday' – Izolo in isiXhosa and isiZulu, two of South Africa’s most commonly spoken indigenous languages.

  abstract: |-
    Context: The concept of citizen science (CS) is currently referred to by many actors inside and outside science and research. Several descriptions of this purportedly new approach of science are often heard in connection with large datasets and the possibilities of mobilizing crowds outside science to assists with observations and classifications. However, other accounts refer to CS as a way of democratizing science, aiding concerned communities in creating data to influence policy and as a way of promoting political decision processes involving environment and health.

    Objective: In this study we analyse two datasets (N = 1935, N = 633) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) with the aim of giving a scientometric description of what the concept of CS entails. We account for its development over time, and what strands of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms.

    Results: Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935), but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms has emerged for the collection and classification of data.

  abstract: |-
    This working paper argues that the growing field of transparency, participation and accountability (TPA) needs a conceptual reboot, to address the limited traction gained so far on the path to accountability. To inform more strategic approaches and to identify the drivers of more sustainable institutional change, fresh analytical work is needed.

    The paper makes the case for one among several possible strategic approaches by distinguishing between 'scaling up' and 'taking scale into account', going on to examine several different ways that ‘scale’ is used in different fields.

    It goes on to explain and discuss the strategy of vertical integration, which involves multi-level coordination by civil society organisations of policy monitoring and advocacy, grounded in broad pro-accountability constituencies. Vertical integration is discussed from several different angles, from its roots in politcal economy to its relationship with citizen voice, its capacity for multi-directional communication, and its relationship with feedback loops.

  abstract: This paper explores how real-time data are made available as “open data”
    using municipal transit data as a case study. Many transit authorities in North
    America and elsewhere have installed technology to gather GPS data in real-time
    from transit vehicles. These data are in high demand in app developer communities
    because of their use in communicating predicted, rather than scheduled, transit
    vehicle arrival times. While many municipalities have chosen to treat real-time
    GPS data as “open data,” the particular nature of real-time GPS data requires
    a different mode of access for developers than what is needed for static data
    files. This, in turn, has created a conflict between the “openness” of the underlying
    data and the sometimes restrictive terms of use which govern access to the real-time
    data through transit authority Application Program Interfaces (APIs). This paper
    explores the implications of these terms of use and considers whether real-time
    data require a separate standard for openness. While the focus is on the transit
    data context, the lessons from this area will have broader implications, particularly
    for open real-time data in the emerging smart cities environment.

  abstract: "The mobile internet provides new and easier ways for people to organise
    themselves, raise issues, take action, and interact with their city. However,
    lack of information or motivation often prevents citizens from regularly contributing
    to the common good. In this paper, we present DoGood, a mobile app that aims at
    motivating citizens to join civic activities in their local community. Our study
    asks to what extent gamification can motivate users to participate in civic activities.
    The term civic activity is not yet well defined, so we collect activities citizens
    consider to be civic in order to work towards a broadly accepted definition of
    the term. The DoGood app uses gamified elements that we studied in order to gauge
    their role in encouraging citizens to submit and promote their civic activities
    as well as to join the activities of others. DoGood was implemented and deployed
    to citizens in a five-week-long user study. The app succeeded in motivating most
    of its users to do more civic activities, and its gamified elements were well
    received.\n\n"

  abstract: Every day automated algorithms make decisions that can amplify the power
    of businesses and governments. Yet as algorithms come to regulate more aspects
    of our lives, the contours of their power can remain difficult to grasp. This
    paper studies the notion of algorithmic accountability reporting as a mechanism
    for elucidating and articulating the power structures, biases, and influences
    that computational artifacts exercise in society. A framework for algorithmic
    power based on autonomous decision-making is proffered and motivates specific
    questions about algorithmic influence. Five cases of algorithmic accountability
    reporting involving the use of reverse engineering methods in journalism are then
    studied and analyzed to provide insight into the method and its application in
    a journalism context. The applicability of transparency policies for algorithms
    is discussed alongside challenges to implementing algorithmic accountability as
    a broadly viable investigative method.

  abstract: In this paper, we contribute to this ongoing discussion by examining current
    and actual instances of governance and governance bodies that at least approximate
    the ideal of multistakeholderism. Part I, below, examines seven institutions and
    fora that serve as real-world examples of multistakeholder governance on the Internet.
    In Part II, we assess these examples to present a number of lessons learned and
    more general reflections that can help us better understand the state of—and prospects
    for—multistakeholder governance of the Internet today.

  abstract: |-
    A new generation of strategies for government accountability is needed, one that fully considers entrenched, institutional obstacles to change. Vertical integration of coordinated civil society policy monitoring and advocacy is one such strategy. Engaging each stage and level of public sector actions in an integrated way can locate the causes of accountability failures, show their interconnected nature, and leverage the local, national and transnational power shifts necessary to produce sustainable institutional change.

    The campaign for indigenous peoples’ rights in the Philippines is both pioneering and long-standing. Indigenous peoples’ claims for self-governance and the use of their ancestral lands has been the driving force of their continuing struggle, which has overlapped with other rights-based campaigns on themes such as the environment, participation in governance, gender equality and peace.

  abstract: Since 2009, Open Government Data initiatives have been launched worldwide
    and the concept of open data is gaining momentum. Open data are often associated
    with realizing ambitions, such as a more transparent and efficient government,
    solving societal problems and increased economic value. However, between proposing
    an open data policy and successful implementation are some practicable obstacles,
    especially for government agencies required to generate sufficient revenue to
    cover their operating costs, so-called self-funding agencies. With lost revenue
    due to open data, there is a real risk that the update frequency and the quality
    of data may suffer or that the open data policy may even have to be reversed.
    This article has researched the financial effects of open data policies for self-funding
    agencies on their business model. The article provides some hands-on proposals
    for self-funding agencies having to implement an open data policy whilst ensuring
    their long-term sustainability.

  abstract: The Internet revolution of democracy, which will transform earthly representative
    democracies by employing the communication and collaboration capabilities of the
    Internet, has yet to come. Here, we enlist the wisdom of our forefathers to lead
    the way. By consulting the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen,
    we distill core values of democracy and derive from them requirements for the
    foundations of e-democracy. Building these foundations can usher the urgently-needed
    revolution of democracy.

  abstract: Government economic development programmes provide opportunities for firms
    to leverage financial incentives for business expansion and relocation. This article
    examines the ability of these incentives to promote employment. Using establishment-level
    data from the state of Kansas as well as original firm-level survey data, I evaluate
    the effectiveness of financial incentives in creating jobs through recipient firms.
    My findings from the establishment-level data indicate that incentive programmes
    have no discernable impact on firm expansion, measured by job creation. In addition,
    the survey data suggest that incentive recipients highly recommend this programme
    to other firms, but few firms actually increased their employment in Kansas because
    of these incentives; similarly, very few firms would have left the state if they
    had not benefited from this programme. Thus, incentives have little impact on
    the relocation or expansion decisions of firms.

  abstract: Co-production establishes an interactive relationship between citizens
    and public service providers. Successful co-production hence requires the engagement
    of citizens. Typically, individual characteristics such as age, gender, and income
    are used to explain why citizens co-produce. In contrast, neighbourhood-level
    variables receive less attention. Nevertheless, the co-production literature,
    as well as social capital and urban planning theory, provides good arguments why
    neighbourhood variables may be relevant. In this study, we examine the administrative
    records of citizen-initiated contacts in a reporting programme for problems in
    the public domain. This co-production programme is located in the district of
    Deurne in the city of Antwerp, Belgium. A multilevel analysis is used to simultaneously
    assess the impact of neighbourhood characteristics and individual variables. While
    the individual variables usually found to explain co-production are present in
    our case, we also find that neighbourhood characteristics significantly explain
    co-production. Thus, our findings suggest that participation in co-production
    activities is determined not only by who you are, but also by where you live.

  abstract: 'Crowdsourcing design has been applied in various areas of graphic design,
    software design, and product design. This paper draws on those experiences and
    research in diversity, creativity and motivation to present a process model for
    crowdsourcing experience design. Crowdsourcing experience design for volunteer
    online communities serves two purposes: to increase the motivation of participants
    by making them stakeholders in the success of the project, and to increase the
    creativity of the design by increasing the diversity of expertise beyond experts
    in experience design. Our process model for crowdsourcing design extends the meta-design
    architecture, where for online communities is designed to be iteratively re-designed
    by its users. We describe how our model has been deployed and adapted to a citizen
    science project where nature preserve visitors can participate in the design of
    a system called NatureNet. The major contribution of this paper is a model for
    crowdsourcing experience design and a case study of how we have deployed it for
    the design and development of NatureNet.'

  abstract: |-
    In this article we critically examine the use of Big Data in the legal system. Big Data is driving a trend towards behavioral optimization and “personalized law,” in which legal decisions and rules are optimized for best outcomes and where law is tailored to individual consumers based on analysis of past data. Big Data, however, has serious limitations and dangers when applied in the legal context. Advocates of Big Data make theoretically problematic assumptions about the objectivity of data and scientific observation. Law is always theory-laden. Although Big Data strives to be objective, law and data have multiple possible meanings and uses and thus require theory and interpretation in order to be applied. Further, the meanings and uses of law and data are indefinite and continually evolving in ways that cannot be captured or predicted by Big Data.

    Due to these limitations, the use of Big Data will likely generate unintended consequences in the legal system. Large-scale use of Big Data will create distortions that adversely influence legal decision-making, causing irrational herding behaviors in the law. The centralized nature of the collection and application of Big Data also poses serious threats to legal evolution and democratic accountability. Furthermore, its focus on behavioral optimization necessarily restricts and even eliminates the local variation and heterogeneity that makes the legal system adaptive. In all, though Big Data has legitimate uses, this article cautions against using Big Data to replace independent legal judgment.

  abstract: "Our report, Making a Success of Digital Government, says that after five
    years of getting more services online, government is hitting a wall. But despite
    some public services still running on last century’s computers, the real barrier
    to progress is not technology but the lack of political drive from the top.\n
    \n Filling your tax return should be as easy as doing online banking. The technology
    exists. But outdated practices and policies mean that, in the case of many government
    services, we are still filling in and posting off forms to be manually processed.
    Taking digital government to the next level – which the report says would satisfy
    citizens and potentially save billions in the process – requires leadership. Civil
    servants need to improve their skills, old systems need to be overhauled, and
    policies need to be updated.\n \n Daniel Thornton, report author, said:\n \n “Tinkering
    around the edges of digital government has taken us only so far – now we need
    a fundamental change in the government’s approach. The starting point is recognising
    that digital is not just for geeks anymore – everyone in government must work
    to make it a success. There are huge potential savings to be made if the Government
    gets this right – which makes it all the more disappointing that the PM and Chancellor
    have not been as explicit about their commitment to digital government as their
    predecessors.”"

  abstract: 'In January 2014, the Centre for Information Policy Leadership (the Centre)
    launched a multiyear project on the risk-based approach to privacy: The Privacy
    Risk Framework Project. This project elaborates on the Centre’s earlier project
    on organisational accountability, particularly in seeking to develop the analytical
    framework and tools needed to implement certain key aspects of accountability.
    Specifically, the goals of this project are set forth in the following Project
    Vision Statement: Principle-based data privacy laws often leave room for interpretation,
    leaving it both to organisations to make appropriate decisions on how to implement
    these principles and to regulators on how to interpret and enforce the law. The
    Privacy Risk Framework Project aims to bridge the gap between high-level privacy
    principles on one hand, and compliance on the ground on the other, by developing
    a methodology for organisations to apply, calibrate and implement abstract privacy
    obligations based on the actual risks and benefits of the proposed data processing.
    While certain types of risk assessments are already an integral part of accountable
    organisations’ privacy management programs, they require further development.
    This project seeks to build consensus on what is meant by privacy risks to individuals
    (and society) and to create a practical framework to identify, prioritise and
    mitigate such risks so that principle-based privacy obligations can be implemented
    appropriately and effectively. On March 20, 2014, the Centre held a workshop in
    Paris during which more than 50 privacy experts, industry representatives and
    regulators discussed their experiences and views with respect to the risk-based
    approach to privacy, the privacy risk framework and methodology, as well as goals
    and next steps in this project. This paper, titled “A Risk-based Approach to Privacy:
    Improving Effectiveness in Practice”, is a developed version of the earlier discussion
    paper distributed to the participants of the workshop. It incorporates feedback
    from the Paris workshop and input received in subsequent consultations with Centre
    members and project participants.'

  abstract: 'More than eighty years after Justice Brandeis coined the phrase “laboratories
    of democracy,” the concept of policy experimentation retains its currency as a
    leading justification for decentralized governance. This Article examines the
    downsides of experimentation, and in particular the potential for decentralization
    to lead to the production of information that exacerbates public choice failures.
    Standard accounts of experimentation and policy learning focus on information
    concerning the social welfare effects of alternative polices. But learning can
    also occur along a political dimension as information about ideological preferences,
    campaign techniques, and electoral incentives is revealed. Both types of information
    can be put to use in the policy arena by a host of individual and institutional
    actors that have a wide range of motives, from public-spirited concern for the
    general welfare to a desire to maximize personal financial returns. In this complex
    environment, there is no guarantee that the information that is generated by experimentation
    will lead to social benefits. This Article applies this insight to prior models
    of federalism developed in the legal and political science literatures to show
    that decentralization can lead to the over-production of socially harmful information.
    As a consequence, policy makers undertaking a decentralization calculation should
    seek a level of decentralization that best balances the costs and benefits of
    information production. To illustrate the legal and policy implications of the
    arguments developed here, this Article examines two contemporary environmental
    rulemakings of substantial political, legal, and economic significance: a rule
    to define the jurisdictional reach of the Clean Water Act; and a rule to limit
    greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity generating sector.'

    Over the last decade, there has been a growing emphasis on making government information available to the public.

    But while technological advances, new systems and updated processes have provided powerful platforms for accessing open data, there has been little or no emphasis on ensuring that women can have an equal share in open governance. Too often, the offline exclusion of women in public life and is being mirrored online.

    A new study from the Carter Center examines women’s right to information in Bangladesh. It asks whether women are able to access information with the same frequency, ease, and rate of success as men - and why.

    In the public sector, Spain has made big efforts not to lag behind digital leaders in terms of public e-readiness and e-government, but the country's economic and political frameworks have dragged it downwards in global Networked Readiness rankings. Literature shows that the crisis of participation and representation is pushing citizens outside of institutional politics and into new kinds of organisations which are strong in digital and social media. However, these efforts do not seem to be able to establish a dialogue with the institutions of representative democracy in order to perform the task that is needed – reform of the aforementioned institutions.

    This Brief looks at initiatives that are working towards enabling citizen voices to be heard.

  abstract: |-
    In Colombia, technological modernisation coexists with activities supported through obsolete technologies and conservative mindsets. The country is in a permanent struggle between tradition and innovation, and as the country is not a technology-creator, technology acceptance involves elements of fashion and psychological dependency from developed countries. Technology is intimately related to economic, political and military domination. The local application of information and communication technologies (ICT) to governance suffers these problems. Information Technology (IT) responds directly or indirectly to the interests of the global elite that created it.

    This report aims to provide an overview of the normative and institutional state of art of ICT-mediated citizen participation in Colombia. The first section provides an overview of the political and civic liberties framework in Colombia. In the second section the landscape of ICT mediated citizen engagement is mapped. In the third section, the report engages with implications of technology mediations for deliberative democracy and transformative citizenship.

  abstract: Media scholars have only recently begun to recognize and investigate the
    importance of algorithms to a wide range of processes related to the production
    and consumption of media content. There have been few efforts thus far, though,
    to connect these developments to potentially relevant bodies of existing theory
    and research. This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring the utility of
    institutional theory as a potentially useful analytical framework for continued
    inquiry into the role of algorithms in the operation of media systems; and by
    offering some suggestions for ways in which an institutional analytical frame
    can be extended into algorithmic contexts.

  abstract: Social media platforms and mobile phone data are commonly mined to produce
    accounts of how people are responding in the aftermath of crisis events. Yet social
    and mobile datasets have limitations that, if not sufficiently understood and
    accounted for, can produce specific kinds of analytical and ethical oversights.
    In this paper, we analyze some of the problems that emerge from the reliance on
    particular forms of crisis data, and we suggest ways forward through a deeper
    engagement with ethical frameworks and a more critical questioning of what crisis
    data actually represents. In particular, the use of Twitter data and crowdsourced
    text messages during crisis events such as Hurricane Sandy and the Haiti Earthquake
    raised questions about the ways in which crisis data act as a system of knowledge.
    We analyze these events from ontological, epistemological, and ethical perspectives
    and assess the challenges of data collection, analysis and deployment. While privacy
    concerns are often dismissed when data is scraped from public-facing platforms
    such as Twitter, we suggest that the kinds of personal information shared during
    a crisis—often as a way to find assistance and support—present ongoing risks.
    We argue for a deeper integration of critical data studies into crisis research,
    and for researchers to acknowledge their role in shaping norms of privacy and
    consent in data use.

  abstract: As cities become more complex and their communities more dispersed, questions
    such as ‘where is home?’ and ‘where and how do I belong?’ are increasingly pertinent.
    If urban space is a system, then it can be challenged through the spatial practice
    of its citizens. This contestation is examined as a form of hacking, an activity

    of a research project, this paper argues that digitally enabled creative writing
    can play a fundamental role within this process, enabling the re-appropriation

    With growing demand for transparency, accountability and citizen participation in
     policy making and service provision, engagement between citizens and their governments,
     as well as with donors and the private sector that deliver government
     services, is increasingly important. Increased use of technology brings both opportunities
     and challenges to citizen engagement processes, including opportunities

     practical steps to assess the extent to which digital tools have contributed to
     citizen engagement and the help to understand the impact that the introduction of
     technology has had on the engagement processes. With examples and lessons from case studies from Brazil, Uganda, Cameroon and
     Kenya, the guide provides practical tools and guidelines for use in evaluating the
     expanding field of digital citizen engagement.

  abstract: "• Participatory sensing is a specialized form of crowdsourcing for mobile
    devices in which the users act as sensors to report on local environmental conditions.
    • This poster describes the process of prototyping a mobile phone crowdsourcing
    app for monitoring parking availability on a large university campus. • We present
    a case study of how an agent-based urban model can be used to perform a sensitivity
    analysis of the comparative susceptibility of different data fusion paradigms
    to potentially troublesome user behaviors: 1. Poor user enrollment, 2. Infrequent
    usage, 3. A preponderance of untrustworthy users."

  abstract: Smart City (SC) initiatives offer best possible outcomes to citizens and
    other stakeholders when those people are involved centrally in all stages of the
    project. However, undertaking design processes that facilitate citizen engagement
    often involves prohibitive challenges in cost, design and deployment mechanisms,
    particularly for small cities that have limited resources. We report on a project
    carried out in Cork City, a small city in Ireland, where a method inspired by
    crowdsourcing was used to involve local participants in decisions regarding small
    city infrastructure. Academics, local government, volunteers and civil organizations
    came together to collaboratively design and carry out a study to represent local
    interests around the deployment of smart city infrastructure. Our projects demonstrates
    a new way of translating crowdsourcing for use in government problem-solving.
    It was comparatively inexpensive, creative in design, and flexible but collaborative
    in deployment, resulting in high volumes of reliable data for project prioritization
    and implementation.

  abstract: GitHub is a web-based digital project hosting service that facilitates
    collaboration. We introduce how GitHub works and assess how it is being used in
    the public sector in Canada based on interviews with federal government leaders
    and a survey of Canadian public service GitHub users. With little research to
    date on public sector use of GitHub, and none on its use in Canadian governments,
    this paper explores the early experience with this particular collaboration tool
    and considers the possible implications for collaboration in government.

  abstract: Transparency is increasingly evoked within public and private climate
    governance arrangements as a key means to enhance accountability and improve environmental
    outcomes. We review assumed links between transparency, accountability and environmental
    sustainability here, by identifying four rationales underpinning uptake of transparency
    in governance. We label these democratization, technocratization, marketization
    and privatization, and assess how they shape the scope and practices of climate
    disclosure, and to what effect. We find that all four are discernible in climate
    governance, yet the technocratic and privatization rationales tend to overtake
    the originally intended (more inclusive, and more public-good oriented) democratization
    and marketization rationales for transparency, particularly during institutionalization
    of disclosure systems. This reduces transparency's potential to enhance accountability
    or trigger more environmentally sustainable outcomes.

  abstract: Rural water services are still not working for poor people. The rising
    mobile phone penetration in Africa raised hopes in the development community that
    mobile phone–based ICT platforms could digitally transform rural water supply
    services. Our approach to platform development is “working with the grain” of
    the information flow between citizens and district officials, in view of emerging
    funding opportunities for water point repair in Tanzania (Payment-by-Results).
    We distinguish between discretionary tasks and transaction-intensive tasks in
    the information flow. An ICT platform for monitoring and repairing rural water
    points should start by digitally transforming tasks with high transaction intensiveness
    and low discretion that occur outside village and district institutions. Actors
    in rural water supply should collaboratively simplify formal rules and procedures
    that govern information flows within local institutions before considering further
    digitization.

    This research aims to explore the potential of the network e ect of the Internet (activity i.e. the service becomes more powerful when more people use it), emphasizing the characteristics of digital tools that can e ectively empower citizens and civic innovators.  e challenge is to exploit the collaborative power of networks (networks of people, of knowledge, and connected things) to harness the collective intelligence
    of communities in order to tackle big social challenges.  ere is great potential to exploit digital network e ects both in social innovation activity and in new services and approaches that generate social value. But much of this potential isn’t yet being realized. Indeed, the “network e ect” of the Internet may still be in its early technical phases and early implementation to maximize social good.

    world of open data measurement. The Measurement Guide is an analysis of the Charter
    principles and how they are assessed based on current open government data measurement
    tools – with a focus on commitments that can be measured, commitments that cannot
    be measured, and existing gaps (e.g. commitments that have not been measured).

  abstract: Citizens and governments live increasingly digital lives, leaving trails
    of digital data that have the potential to support unprecedented levels of mutual
    government–citizen understanding, and in turn, vast improvements to public policies
    and services. Open data and open government initiatives promise to “open up” government
    operations to citizens. New forms of “big data” analysis can be used by government
    itself to understand citizens' behavior and reveal the strengths and weaknesses
    of policy and service delivery. In practice, however, open data emerges as a reform
    development directed to a range of goals, including the stimulation of economic
    development, and not strictly transparency or public service improvement. Meanwhile,
    governments have been slow to capitalize on the potential of big data, while the
    largest data they do collect remain “closed” and under-exploited within the confines
    of intelligence agencies. Drawing on interviews with civil servants and researchers
    in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States between 2011 and 2014, this
    article argues that a big data approach could offer the greatest potential as
    a vehicle for improving mutual government–citizen understanding, thus embodying
    the core tenets of Digital Era Governance, argued by some authors to be the most
    viable public management model for the digital age (Dunleavy, Margetts, Bastow,
    & Tinkler, 2005, 2006; Margetts & Dunleavy, 2013).

    This report outlines the values of harnessing mobile data for social good and provides an analysis of the gaps. Its aim is to survey the landscape today, assess the current barriers to scale, and make recommendations for a way forward.

    The report reviews the challenges the field is currently facing and discusses a range of issues preventing mobile data from being used for social good. These challenges come from both the demand and supply side of mobile data and from the lack of coordination among stakeholders. It continues by providing a set of recommendations intended to move beyond short-term and ad hoc projects to more systematic and institutionalized implementations that are scalable, replicable, sustainable and focused on impact.

    Finally, the report proposes a roadmap for 2018 calling all stakeholders to work on developing a scalable and impactful demonstration project that will help to establish the value of mobile data for social good. The report includes examples of innovation projects and ways in which mobile data is already being used to inform development and humanitarian work. It is intended to inspire social impact organizations and mobile network operators (MNOs) to collaborate in the exploration and application of new data sources, methods and technologies.

  abstract: Detailed and confidential data collected by government agencies have traditionally
    been difficult to access by analysts and researchers, despite the advantages to
    society from doing so. Access has, until recently, been constrained by technological
    and legal barriers; however, developments have reduced the impact of these. Despite
    these developments, accessing detailed, and confidential data, for analysis and
    research, remains difficult. However, Research Data Centres (RDCs) provide a solution
    to reassure and efficiently distribute the risk of providing access to these data
    sources. This paper explains how RDCs can act as a ‘broker’ for enabling access
    to confidential data sources.

  abstract: Recent advances in online civic engagement tools have created a digital
    civic space replete with opportunities to craft and critique laws and rules or
    evaluate candidates, ballot measures, and policy ideas. These civic spaces, however,
    remain largely disconnected from one another, such that tremendous energy dissipates
    from each civic portal. Long-term feedback loops also remain rare. We propose
    addressing these limitations by building an integrative online commons that links
    together the best existing tools by making them components in a larger “Democracy
    Machine.” Drawing on gamification principles, this integrative platform would
    provide incentives for drawing new people into the civic sphere, encouraging more
    sustained and deliberative engagement, and feedback back to government and citizen
    alike to improve how the public interfaces with the public sector. After describing
    this proposed platform, we consider the most challenging problems it faces and
    how to address them.

  abstract: For public sector organizations across the world, the pressures for improved
    efficiency during the past decades are now accompanied by an equally strong need
    to revolutionise service delivery to create solutions that better meet citizens’
    needs; to develop channels that offer efficiency and increase inclusion to all
    citizens being served; and to re-invent supply chains to deliver services faster,
    cheaper, and more effectively. But how do government organisations ensure investment
    in digital transformation delivers the intended outcomes after earlier “online
    government” and “e-government” initiatives produced little in terms of significant,
    sustainable benefits? Here we focus on how digitisation, built on open standards,
    is transforming the public sector’s relationship with its citizens. This paper
    provides a perspective of digital change efforts across the UK government as an
    illustration of the improvements taking place more broadly in the public sector.
    It provides a vision for the future of our digital world, revealing the symbiotic
    relationship between organisational change and digitisation, and offering insights
    into public service delivery in the digital economy

  abstract: |-
    Digital technology undoubtedly has huge potential to contribute to the functions of government and public administration, but so far the building of information portals and putting transactions on government web sites have not realised the great expectations for it in terms of “transforming government”. This Working Paper explores why the ambitions for transformational e-government (however it has been labelled) over the last 20 years have not been realised. It provides a critical analysis to offer a diagnosis of the problem and its causes. In the hope of a better future, it develops a structured frame of reference for making sense of how information and communications technologies (ICT), in all their forms, really fit within the world of government and public administration.

    To actually achieve a transformation of government through the use of digital technologies, governments will require a complete reversal of the current way of looking at the challenge. Instead of viewing the problem from the point of view of the internet, they must start with the political process of policy design. In particular, they must look at how technology can change the range and characteristics of policy instruments — the tools that governments choose from to intervene in the economy, society and environment to make change, such as taxes, benefits, licences, information campaigns and more tangible things like public services and infrastructure. These are the practical results of government, and only when technology changes those can we say it has transformed government.

    Federal government statistics provide critical information to the country and serve a key role in a democracy. For decades, sample surveys with instruments carefully designed for particular data needs have been one of the primary methods for collecting data for federal statistics. However, the costs of conducting such surveys have been increasing while response rates have been declining, and many surveys are not able to fulfill growing demands for more timely information and for more detailed information at state and local levels.

    Innovations in Federal Statistics examines the opportunities and risks of using government administrative and private sector data sources to foster a paradigm shift in federal statistical programs that would combine diverse data sources in a secure manner to enhance federal statistics. This first publication of a two-part series discusses the challenges faced by the federal statistical system and the foundational elements needed for a new paradigm.

  abstract: 'In 2008 the first Swiss canton introduced internet voting for expatriates,
    thus initiating the second phase in Switzerland’s piecemeal i-voting roll-out.
    More cantons soon followed, and as of this writing expatriates from 12 out of
    the 26 cantons can vote online. This paper focuses on the second phase involving
    expatriates. We address three questions at the core of the internet voting research
    agenda. First, the popularity question: to what extent do expatriates make use
    of the new online channel? Second, the ‘who’ question: what is the profile of
    the typical expatriate i-voter? Finally, the turnout question: did the extension
    of internet voting to the expatriates have an effect on electoral mobilization?
    Our findings indicate that the online channel is very popular among expatriates,
    both if compared to other trials in Switzerland itself and internationally. On
    the other hand, known patterns regarding the profile of i-voters and the effect
    on mobilization seem to be also replicated in the expatriate trials. Expatriate
    i-voters tend to be young, male, and there is some evidence of an upper-class
    bias. Thus, usage of the online channel seems driven by the digital divide also
    among expatriates. Moreover, we find some evidence that i-voting did not affect
    electoral mobilization, similarly to trials involving residents.'

  abstract: This handbook is a unique and original contribution of over thirty chapters
    of over thirty chapters on behavioral economics, examining and addressing an important
    stream of research where the starting assumption is that decision-makers are for
    the most part relatively smart or rational. This particular approach is in contrast
    to the theme running through much contemporary work where individuals’ behavior
    is deemed irrational, biased, and error-prone, often due to how people are hardwired.
    In the smart people approach, where errors or biases occur and when social dilemmas
    arise, more often than not, improving the decision-making environment can repair
    these problems without hijacking or manipulating the preferences of decision-makers.
    This book covers a wide-range of themes from micro to macro, including various
    sub-disciplines without economics such as economic psychology, heuristics, fast
    and slow-thinking, neuroeconomics, experiments, and the capabilities approach,
    institutional economics, methodology, nudging ethics, and public policy.

  abstract: 'Community capacity is used to monitor socioeconomic development. It is
    composed of a number of dimensions that can be measured to understand issues possibly
    arising in the implementation of a policy or of a project targeting a community.
    Measuring these dimensions is thus highly valuable for policymakers and local
    administrator, though expensive and time consuming. To address this issue, we
    evaluated their estimation through a machine learning technique—Random Forests—applied
    to secondary open government data and determined the most important variables
    for prediction. We focused on two dimensions: sense of community and participation.
    The variables included in the data sets used to train the predictive models complied
    with two criteria: nationwide availability and sufficiently fine-grained geographic
    breakdown, that is, neighborhood level. Our resultant models are more accurate
    than others based on traditional statistics found in the literature, showing the
    feasibility of the approach. The most determinant variables in our models were
    only partially in agreement with the most influential factors for sense of community
    and participation according to the social science literature consulted, providing
    a starting point for future investigation under a social science perspective.
    Moreover, due to the lack of geographic detail of the outcome measures available,
    further research is required to apply the predictive models to a neighborhood
    level.'

  abstract: "VOTO Mobile is a Ghanaian tech company and social enterprise. One of
    the tools it uses is the interactive voice response (IVR) survey. This entails
    survey respondents being called on their mobile phone, and prompted by pre-recorded
    messages to respond to questions by pressing buttons on the phone; the results
    are stored on a database.\n\nCDD-Ghana is a non-profit organisation focusing on
    good governance. It has worked with UNICEF to develop the District League Table
    (DLT), a tool for measuring and highlighting discrepancies in local government
    service delivery in different sectors.\n\nTheir research set out to examine:\n-
    whether VOTO Mobile’s IVR methodology would be suitable for gathering data for
    future editions of the DLT \n- how far the DLT reflected the priorities of Ghanaian
    citizens\n- how IVR could be adapted to maximise the response rate of rural women.\n\nThis
    practice paper describes the research, its findings and its implications. It also
    reflects on the challenges facing a tech provider and a CSO in working together
    to develop tools for citizen engagement in local government monitoring."

  abstract: In this paper we describe the evolution and development of the police.uk
    and data.police.uk sites, which publish open data about crime and justice in the
    UK, and make it accessible and comprehensible to the public. Police.uk has received
    over 64 million visits (754 million hits) since launching in January 2011. Open
    crime and justice data represents a key sector in the UK open data landscape,
    and citizens are keen to engage with the criminal justice system to become more
    informed about local levels of crime and other policing information. This paper
    sets out the policing context in the UK, discusses the journey in providing such
    open data, the processes involved and challenges encountered, and explores possible
    future developments.

  abstract: This paper examines some of the science communication challenges involved
    when designing and conducting public deliberation processes on issues of national
    importance. We take as our illustrative case study a recent research project investigating
    public values and attitudes toward future energy system change for the United
    Kingdom. National-level issues such as this are often particularly difficult to
    engage the public with because of their inherent complexity, derived from multiple
    interconnected elements and policy frames, extended scales of analysis, and different
    manifestations of uncertainty. With reference to the energy system project, we
    discuss ways of meeting a series of science communication challenges arising when
    engaging the public with national topics, including the need to articulate systems
    thinking and problem scale, to provide balanced information and policy framings
    in ways that open up spaces for reflection and deliberation, and the need for
    varied methods of facilitation and data synthesis that permit access to participants’
    broader values. Although resource intensive, national-level deliberation is possible
    and can produce useful insights both for participants and for science policy.

  abstract: |-
    Civic technology is mostly used to refer to NGO led digital initiatives designed to bridge the gap between citizen and institution. However, since the rise of Code for America and similar organisations around the world, civic citizen-focused tech has increasingly been developed and implemented by and with public bodies themselves in an attempt to reach out to citizens and increase engagement and participation. Whilst early civic tech tended to focus on country-level issues, these initiatives are now proliferating at sub-national levels, particularly in cities. These emerging sub-national and municipal level civic technologies form the focus of this research, which explores five case studies of municipal civic tech operating in the US. It examines not only the impacts of this tech upon citizen users, but the effects it has upon the implementing institutions. Whilst many governments in the world are still working with centralised forms of digital governance, the US has over the last 10 years experienced a plurality of growth in sub-state civic tech usage by city and municipal governments. This nascent government civic tech environment provided a most fertile opportunity for research into the operations and impacts of civic tech employed by official institutions.

    This project was designed to examine how civic tech implemented by government is currently operating, who is using it, and what impacts it is having upon service delivery. The aim of this research is therefore to provide a comprehensive picture of civic technology implementation by municipal level public bodies and the challenges and benefits that arise in the process. It is hoped that this report will be of practical use to both public bodies and civic technologists working with them.

    The primary deliverable of this project was five case studies of civic tech projects that have been deployed by US cities since 2013:

    - SpeakUpAustin (www.speakupaustin.org), in Austin, Texas
    - LargeLots (www.largelots.org), in Chicago, Illinois
    - RecordTrac (records.oaklandnet.com), in Oakland, California
    - DC311 (311.dc.gov), in Washington, DC
    - Office of Professional Accountability (OPA) Police Complaint Tracker (www.seattle.gov/opa/file-acomplaint-about-the-seattle-police), in Seattle, Washington

    In the study, the users of the civic tech tools and the implementers of the tools within government were interviewed about the impact of the tool’s introduction on the delivery of the relevant public service, how these additional sources of public input affected the departments where they had been introduced, whether the department had noted increased efficiency, and whether internal or external stakeholders perceived increased effectiveness.

    The civic technology tools examined in this study were generally well-appreciated both internally and externally, receiving good reviews both from the government and non-government sides of their use. People inside and outside of government appreciated the benefits of using them, and expressed interest in maintaining and improving them.

  abstract: "ntelligence services, government administrations, businesses, and a growing
    majority of the population are hooked on the idea that big data can reveal patterns
    and correlations in everyday life. Initiated by software engineers and carried
    out through algorithms, the mining of big data has sparked a silent revolution.
    But algorithmic analysis and data mining are not simply byproducts of media development
    or the logical consequences of computation. They are the radicalization of the
    Enlightenment's quest for knowledge and progress. Data Love argues that the \"cold
    civil war\" of big data is taking place not among citizens or between the citizen
    and government but within each of us.\n \n Roberto Simanowski elaborates on the
    changes data love has brought to the human condition while exploring the entanglements
    of those who—out of stinginess, convenience, ignorance, narcissism, or passion—contribute
    to the amassing of ever more data about their lives, leading to the statistical
    evaluation and individual profiling of their selves. Writing from a philosophical
    standpoint, Simanowski illustrates the social implications of technological development
    and retrieves the concepts, events, and cultural artifacts of past centuries to
    help decode the programming of our present."

  abstract: "What do world-class teams do that others don't? How do those teams think,
    make decisions and respond to challenges?\n\nStronger Together will help readers
    to understand what differentiates world-class teams from the rest. Using these
    insights, readers can apply the same key principles when leading - or being a
    part of - a team, whether they are in a business or sports environment. \n\nTo
    illustrate how world-class teams operate and how they're led, the author draws
    on examples of teamwork from a diverse range of disciplines, from The Red Arrows
    to SAS Units, a Formula One Pit Crew, Americas Cup yacht crews, World Championship
    sports teams and more. He includes case studies from his work with elite professional,
    international and Olympic sports teams, plus executive leadership teams from businesses.\n\nThis
    truly insightful and fascinating book lifts the lid on what it takes to be the
    best and how we can translate these lessons to our own performance."

    Why do some citizens receive better municipal services than others?

    Comparative political economy is deeply concerned with this question, but most answers so far suggest that unequal access to these services is determined by either class or partisan voting. This research from Pakistan found that the unequal provision of functional municipal services is a particular challenge in the central neighbourhoods of megacities in emerging democracies.

    What explains this trend? The difference in urban citizens’ access to services in Lahore appears to be linked to the density of party worker networks at the local level, and to levels of electoral competition faced by political representatives.

  abstract: Thousands of lives are lost every year in developing countries for failing
    to detect epidemics early because of the lack of real-time disease surveillance
    data. We present results from a large-scale deployment of a telephone triage service
    as a basis for dengue forecasting in Pakistan. Our system uses statistical analysis
    of dengue-related phone calls to accurately forecast suspected dengue cases 2
    to 3 weeks ahead of time at a subcity level (correlation of up to 0.93). Our system
    has been operational at scale in Pakistan for the past 3 years and has received
    more than 300,000 phone calls. The predictions from our system are widely disseminated
    to public health officials and form a critical part of active government strategies
    for dengue containment. Our work is the first to demonstrate, with significant
    empirical evidence, that an accurate, location-specific disease forecasting system
    can be built using analysis of call volume data from a public health hotline.

  abstract: Municipal staff and politicians are moving aside to let someone else make
    budget decisions – community residents. This practice, known as participatory
    budgeting or PB, is a completely different way of managing public money. It allows
    the public to both identify projects and programs that they want to see in their
    neighbourhoods, and to vote on which ones to fund. The process was developed twenty-five
    years ago and there are now over 1,500 participatory budgets around the world.

  abstract: A governance infrastructure is the collection of technologies and systems,
    people, policies, practices, and relationships that interact to support governing
    activities. Information technology, especially communication and computational
    technologies, continues to augment society’s ability to organize, interact, and
    govern. As we think about the future of governance, this article challenges us
    to move beyond questions of how to best manage government institutions to how
    to design smart governance systems with the appropriate incentives and rules to
    harness and coordinate the enthusiasm and capabilities of those governed. This
    article anticipates how the interaction of technology and society can be leveraged
    to mindfully design an interaction-defined, participation-based governance infrastructure
    to return power to the people while increasing accountability. Supporting examples
    of such governance approaches already exist and are regularly emerging in distributed
    organizations, online communities, nonprofits, and governments.

  abstract: "The emergence of open networked models made possible by digital technology
    has the potential to transform international development. Open network structures
    allow people to come together to share information, organize, and collaborate.
    Open development harnesses this power, to create new organizational forms and
    improve people’s lives; it is not only an agenda for research and practice but
    also a statement about how to approach international development. In this volume,
    experts explore a variety of applications of openness, addressing challenges as
    well as opportunities.\n\nOpen development requires new theoretical tools that
    focus on real world problems, consider a variety of solutions, and recognize the
    complexity of local contexts. After exploring the new theoretical terrain, the
    book describes a range of cases in which open models address such specific development
    issues as biotechnology research, improving education, and access to scholarly
    publications. Contributors then examine tensions between open models and existing
    structures, including struggles over privacy, intellectual property, and implementation.
    Finally, contributors offer broader conceptual perspectives, considering processes
    of social construction, knowledge management, and the role of individual intent
    in the development and outcomes of social models. "

  abstract: |-
    Corruption has a devastating impact on the lives of people around the world. When money that should be spent on schools, hospitals and other government services ends up in the hands of dishonest officials, everyone suffers. That’s why we’re launching the Open Up Guide: Using Open Data to Combat Corruption. We think that with the right conditions in place, greater transparency can lead to more accountability, less corruption and better outcomes for citizens. This guide builds on the work in this area already done by the G20’s anti-corruption working group, Transparency International and the Web Foundation.
    Inside the guide you’ll find a number of tools including:

    - A short overview on how open data can be used to combat corruption.
    - Use cases and methodologies: A series of case studies highlighting existing and future approaches to the use of open data in the anti-corruption field.
    - 30 priority datasets and the key attributes needed so that they can talk to each other. To address corruption networks it is particularly important that connections can be established and followed across data sets, national borders and different sectors.
    - Data standards: Standards describe what should be published, and the technical details of how it should be made available. The report includes some of the relevant standards for anti-corruption work, and highlights the areas where there are currently no standards.

    The guide has been developed by Transparency International-Mexico, Open Contracting Partnership and the Open Data Charter, building on input from government officials, open data experts, civil society and journalists. It’s been designed as a practical tool for governments who want to use open data to fight corruption.

  abstract: American democracy just isn’t good enough anymore. A costly election has
    done more to divide American society than unite it, while trust in government--and
    democracy itself--is plummeting. But there are better systems out there, and America
    would be wise to learn from them. In this provocative manifesto, globalization
    scholar Parag Khanna tours cutting-edge nations from Switzerland to Singapore
    to reveal the inner workings that allow them that lead the way in managing the
    volatility of a fast-changing world while delivering superior welfare and prosperity
    for their citizens. The ideal form of government for the complex 21st century
    is what Khanna calls a "direct technocracy," one led by experts but perpetually
    consulting the people through a combination of democracy and data. From a seven-member
    presidency and a restructured cabinet to replacing the Senate with an Assembly
    of Governors, Technocracy in America is full of sensible proposals that have been
    proven to work in the world’s most successful societies. Americans have a choice
    for whom they elect president, but they should not wait any longer to redesign
    their political system following Khanna’s pragmatic vision.

  abstract: 'The Internet provides a global information flow, which improves living
    conditions in poor countries as well as in rich countries. Owing to its abundance
    and quality, public information (meteorological, geographic, transport information.
    and also the content managed in libraries, archives and museums) is an incentive
    for change, becoming invaluable and accessible to all citizens. However, it is
    clear that Open Data plays a significant role and provides a business service
    in the digital economy. Nevertheless, it is unknown how this amount of public
    data may be introduced as universal service to make it available to all citizens
    in matters of education, health, culture . In fact, a function or role which has
    traditionally been assumed by libraries. In addition, information professionals
    will have to acquire new skills that enable them to assume a new role in the information
    management: data management (Open Data) and content management (Open Content).
    Thus, this study analyzes new roles, which will be assumed by new information
    professionals such as metadata, interoperability, access licenses, information
    search and retrieval tools and applications for data queries.'

  abstract: This article argues that search engines raise not merely technical issues
    but also political ones. Our study of search engines suggests that they systematically
    exclude (in some cases by design and in some, accidentally) certain sites and
    certain types of sites in favor of others, systematically giving prominence to
    some at the expense of others. We argue that such biases, which would lead to
    a narrowing of the Web's functioning society, run counter to the basic architecture
    of the Web as well as to the values and ideals that have fueled widespread support
    for its growth and development. We consider ways of addressing the politics of
    search engines, raising doubts whether, in particular, the market mechanism could
    serve as an acceptable corrective.

  abstract: |-
    Democracy Reinvented is the first comprehensive academic treatment of participatory budgeting in the United States, situating it within a broader trend of civic technology and innovation. This global phenomenon, which has been called “revolutionary civics in action” by the New York Times, started in Brazil in 1989 but came to America only in 2009.  Participatory budgeting empowers citizens to identify community needs, work with elected officials to craft budget proposals, and vote on how to spend public funds.

    Democracy Reinvented places participatory budgeting within the larger discussion of the health of U.S. democracy and focuses on the enabling political and institutional conditions.  Author and former White House policy adviser Hollie Russon Gilman presents theoretical insights, in-depth case studies, and interviews to offer a compelling alternative to the current citizen disaffection and mistrust of government. She offers policy recommendations on how to tap online tools and other technological and civic innovations to promote more inclusive governance.

    While most literature tends to focus on institutional changes without solutions, this book suggests practical ways to empower citizens to become change agents. Democracy Reinvented also includes a discussion on the challenges and opportunities that come with using digital tools to re-engage citizens in governance.

  abstract: This article examines citizen science projects, defined as “a form of
    open collaboration where members of the public participate in the scientific process,
    including identifying research questions, collecting and analyzing the data, interpreting
    the results, and problem solving,” as an effective and innovative tool for National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) science in line with the Obama Administration's
    Open Government Directive. Citizen science projects allow volunteers with no technical
    training to participate in analysis of large sets of data that would otherwise
    constitute prohibitively tedious and lengthy work for research scientists. Zooniverse.com
    hosts a multitude of popular space-focused citizen science projects, many of which
    have been extraordinarily successful and have enabled new research publications
    and major discoveries. This article takes a multifaceted look at such projects
    by examining the benefits of citizen science, effective game design, and current
    desktop computer and mobile device usage trends. It offers suggestions of potential
    research topics to be studied with emerging technologies, policy considerations,

  abstract: |-
    "Organizations are highly interested in integrative open innovation practices in their structure, as open innovation can bring a flood of creative contributions and problem solving from the public. However, there are significant challenges in successful adoption. One reason for this difficulty stems from conflicting organizational structures; open innovation practices are primarily online, fluid, rapid, iterative, and often temporary, whereas the command and control hierarchical structure of organizations are intended to be stable and to complete sustained services. Another source of this difficulty for administrators who are designing and managing open innovation efforts for the first time. Most administrators in organizations rarely have extensive technological or socio-technical design background or training. Therefore, an entire new skill set is being developed on to use participatory platforms. Even if the design and tech know-how is part of an administrator's toolkit, they may not know how to effectively align the goals, language, and evaluation metrics for successful implementation of participatory efforts. More often than not, administrators are attempting to run an open innovation effort in addition to their other, primary duties. Finally, even though open innovation tools like participatory platforms have existed for several years, there is high fragmentation and silos of working knowledge, meaning that many administrators continue to experiment in de facto isolation.

    This paper presents a case study of a public university that has made a purposeful effort to integrate open innovation values and practices into its organizational mission and work. To best understand the process of open innovation adoption and use, we interviewed administrative intermediaries who are primarily responsible for the design, management, and evaluation of open innovation platforms and programs. We explored intermediary administrators' experiences with open innovation adoption using organizational learning theory. We specifically asked questions along dimensions of design and management values, teamwork, and organizational innovation culture. We used theoretical pattern matching to explore how the experiences of interview respondents aligned with theoretical propositions of organizational learning. Our analysis provides detailed insights one best practices, challenges, and lessons learned in the design and management of participatory platforms within the organization. This study has four key findings to contribute to the management of open innovation practices in organizations. First, the best team and approaches cannot thrive within the right culture. Second, developing culture takes time and consistent and persistent work from administrators throughout the organization. Third, three types of hybridity were identified by intermediaries in the execution of their innovation effort. These include unintentional, segmented, and fluid hybridity arrangements. Fourth, administrative intermediaries can identify what is likely to lead to successful or unsuccessful implementation of open innovation platforms. These findings contribute a foundation about open innovation management that can assist other administrators in organizations seeking to integrate innovation and entrepreneurship practices into their core mission and daily activities.

  abstract: 'This article investigates the metaphor of the Quantified Self (QS) as
    it is presented in the magazine Wired (2008–2012). Four interrelated themes—transparency,
    optimization, feedback loop, and biohacking—are identified as formative in defining
    a new numerical self and promoting a dataist paradigm. Wired captures certain
    interests and desires with the QS metaphor, while ignoring and downplaying others,
    suggesting that the QS positions self-tracking devices and applications as interfaces
    that energize technological engagements, thereby pushing us to rethink life in
    a data-driven manner. The thematic analysis of the QS is treated as a schematic
    aid for raising critical questions about self-quantification, for instance, detecting
    the merging of epistemological claims, technological devices, and market-making
    efforts. From this perspective, another definition of the QS emerges: a knowledge
    system that remains flexible in its aims and can be used as a resource for epistemological
    inquiry and in the formation of alternative paradigms.'

  abstract: The study of socio-technical systems has been revolutionized by the unprecedented
    amount of digital records that are constantly being produced by human activities
    such as accessing Internet services, using mobile devices, and consuming energy
    and knowledge. In this paper, we describe the richest open multi-source dataset
    ever released on two geographical areas. The dataset is composed of telecommunications,
    weather, news, social networks and electricity data from the city of Milan and
    the Province of Trentino. The unique multi-source composition of the dataset makes
    it an ideal testbed for methodologies and approaches aimed at tackling a wide
    range of problems including energy consumption, mobility planning, tourist and
    migrant flows, urban structures and interactions, event detection, urban well-being
    and many others.

  abstract: 'This paper is the first of the IDB''s "Innovations in Public Service
    Delivery" series, which identifies and analyzes innovative experiences of promising
    practices in Latin America and the Caribbean and around the world to improve the
    quality and delivery of public services. It presents the 311 Programs in New York
    City and Chicago, leading 311 centers in the United States. "311" is the universal
    toll-free number that provides citizens with a single point of entry to a wide
    array of information and services in major cities. In the cities studied, these
    centers have evolved to support new models of service delivery management. This
    publication provides an overview of these programs, analyzing their design and
    implementation, results, and impacts, and identifying their success factors. The
    final section consolidates the lessons learned from these experiences, highlighting
    what policymakers and public officials should consider when developing similar
    solutions. - See more at: http://publications.iadb.org/handle/11319/6765?scope=123456789/1&thumbnail=true&rpp=5&page=1&group_by=none&etal=0#sthash.yyDAO9OJ.dpuf'

  abstract: Open data has spurred economic innovation, social transformation, and
    fresh forms of political and government accountability in recent years, but few
    people understand how open data works. This comprehensive report, developed with
    support from Omidyar Network, presents detailed case studies of open data projects
    throughout the world, along with in-depth analysis of what works and what doesn’t.
    Authors Andrew Young and Stefaan Verhulst, both with The GovLab at New York University,
    explain how these projects have made governments more accountable and efficient,
    helped policymakers find solutions to previously intractable public problems,
    created new economic opportunities, and empowered citizens through new forms of
    social mobilization.

  abstract: |-
    As people spend increasing proportions of their daily lives using social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, they are being invited to support myriad political causes by sharing, liking, endorsing, or downloading. Chain reactions caused by these tiny acts of participation form a growing part of collective action today, from neighborhood campaigns to global political movements. Political Turbulence reveals that, in fact, most attempts at collective action online do not succeed, but some give rise to huge mobilizations—even revolutions.

    Drawing on large-scale data generated from the Internet and real-world events, this book shows how mobilizations that succeed are unpredictable, unstable, and often unsustainable. To better understand this unruly new force in the political world, the authors use experiments that test how social media influence citizens deciding whether or not to participate. They show how different personality types react to social influences and identify which types of people are willing to participate at an early stage in a mobilization when there are few supporters or signals of viability. The authors argue that pluralism is the model of democracy that is emerging in the social media age—not the ordered, organized vision of early pluralists, but a chaotic, turbulent form of politics.

    This book demonstrates how data science and experimentation with social data can provide a methodological toolkit for understanding, shaping, and perhaps even predicting the outcomes of this democratic turbulence.

  abstract: The disclosure of open government data is a complex activity that may
    create public value yet might also encounter risks, such as the misinterpretation
    and misuse of data. While politicians support data release and assume that the
    positive value of open data will dominate, many governmental organizations are
    reluctant to open their data, as they are afraid of the dark side. The objective
    of this paper is to provide a decision-making model that assists in trade-offs
    between the pros and cons of open data. Data disclosure is dependent on the type
    of data (e.g. its sensitivity, structure and quality) and the context (e.g. organizational
    policies, legislation and the political influences). Based on the literature and
    fifteen in-depth interviews with public sector officials and data archivists,
    this paper identifies contextual and dataset-related variables which influence
    a trade-off. A decision-making model is presented capturing trade-offs, and in
    this way providing guidance for weighing the creation of public value and the
    risks. The model can be used for decision-making to open or not to open data.
    It is likely that the decision regarding which data should be opened or closed
    will shift over time.

    Greater ICT availability in South Africa suggests a growing possibility for citizens to use mobile phones and Internet to hold government accountable. However, there is a paucity of literature that maps ICT-mediated engagement initiatives within marginalised sub-populations.

    This study attempts to explore this gap, looking at an initiative in one of the largest informal markets of sub-Saharan Africa. The study provides analytical insights into ICT micro-level initiative, the 'Empowering Street Traders through Urban Disaster Risk Management' project, undertaken as a partnership between the non-governmental organization (NGO) Asiye eTafuleni, local market traders, and the metropolitan municipality.

  abstract: Scale is an overlooked issue in the literature on interactive governance.
    This special issue investigates the challenges posed by the scale and scaling
    of network and collaborative forms of governance. Our original motivation arose
    from a concern about whether collaborative governance can scale up. As we learned
    more, our inquiry expanded to include the tensions inherent in collaboration across
    scales or at multiple scales and the issue of dynamically scaling collaboration
    to adapt to changing problems and demands. The diverse cases in this special issue
    explore these challenges in a range of concrete empirical domains than span the
    globe.

  abstract: "This book examines the impact of digital innovation on organizations.
    It reveals how the digital revolution is redefining traditional levels of analysis
    while at the same time blurring the internal and external boundaries of the organizational
    environment. It presents a collection of research papers that examine the interaction
    between Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and behavior from a threefold
    perspective: First, they analyze individual behavior in terms of specific organizational
    practices like learning, collaboration and knowledge transfer, as well as the
    use of ICT within the organization. Second, they explore the dynamics at work
    on the border between the internal and the external environments by analyzing
    the organizational impact of ICT usage outside the company, as can be seen in
    employer branding, consumer behavior and organizational image. Third, they investigate
    how ICT is being adopted to help face societal challenges outside the company
    like waste and pollution, smart cities, and e-government. \n The diversity of
    views offered makes this book particularly relevant for users, companies, scientists
    and governments. The content is based on a selection of the best papers – original
    double-blind peer reviewed contributions –presented at the annual conference of
    the Italian chapter of AIS, which took place in Rome, Italy, in October 2015,
    or in other reputable international peer-refereed Information Systems conferences."

  abstract: 'Constitutional reform is a tedious process that requires long periods
    of time, a relatively broad consensus among the political actors, and often needs
    popular approval. In spite of these, Romania changed its constitution once (2003)
    and witnessed several unsuccessful revisions. The most recent attempt, in 2013,
    has introduced the deliberative dimension in the form of a constitutional forum.
    This article investigates the legitimacy of this deliberative practice using a
    tri-dimensional approach: input, throughput, and output legitimacy. Our qualitative
    study relying on direct observation and secondary data analysis concludes that
    while input and throughput legitimacy were achieved to great extent, the output
    legitimacy was low.'

  abstract: Governments around the world make their data available through platforms
    but, disappointingly, the use of this data is lagging behind. This problem has
    been recognized in the literature and to facilitate use of open datasets, scholars
    have focused on identifying general user requirements for open data practices
    and specific contexts of usage. This study, therefore, argues that next to general
    requirements, we also need to collect context-specific user requirements for open
    data platforms. We take different societal isues at the starting point for open
    data platform design. To illustrate the value of this context-specific approach,
    we apply scenario-based design methodology in the Provice of Groningen in The
    Netherlands. The results show that different scenarios result partly in similar
    but also partly in different user requirements, leading to a deeper and richer
    understanding of user requirements. We conclude that a context-specific approach
    thereby connecting data, users and societal issues can be used to guide government
    agencies and designers in effort to develop open data platforms that actually
    meet the needs of citizens.

    of countries from Latin America, MENA and South East Asia regions. Based on the
    2015 Survey on Open Government and Citizen Participation in the Policy Cycle,
    the report identifies future areas of work, including the effort to mobilise and
    engage all branches and all levels of government in order to move from open governments
    to open states; how open government principles and practices can help achieve
    the UN Sustainable Development Goals; the role of the Media to create an enabling
    environment for open government initiatives to thrive; and the growing importance
    of subnational institutions to implement successful open government reforms.

    Under what circumstances do new constitutions promote democracy? Between 1974 and 2011,
    the level of democracy increased in 62 countries following the adoption of a new constitution,
    but decreased or stayed the same in 70 others. Using data covering all 138 new constitutions in
    118 countries during that period, we explain this divergence through empirical tests showing
    that overall increased participation during the process of making the constitution positively
    impacts post-promulgation levels of democracy. Then, after disaggregating constitution making
    into three stages (drafting, debating, and ratification) we find compelling evidence through
    robust statistical tests that the degree of citizen participation in the drafting stage has a much
    greater impact on the resulting regime. This lends support to some core principles of
    “deliberative” theories of democracy. We conclude that constitutional reformers should focus
    more on generating public “buy in” at the front end of the constitution-making process, rather
    than concentrating on ratification and referendums at the “back end” that are unlikely to correct
    for an “original sin” of limited citizen deliberation during drafting.

  abstract: |+
    Over the last three years, the Boston Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, the innovative, collaborative ethos within City Hall fostered by Mayor Menino and his current chief of staff, Mitchell Weiss, and Boston's launch of a CRM system and its associated Citizens Connect smartphone app have all attracted substantial media attention. In particular, the City of Boston's strategy to put citizen engagement and participation at the center of its efforts, implemented by Chris Osgood and Nigel Jacob as co-chairs of the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, has drawn attention to the potential power of collaboration and technology to transform citizens' connections to their government and to each other. Several global developments have combined to make Boston's collaborative efforts interesting: First, city managers around the world confront shrinking budgets and diminishing trust in the role of government; second, civic entrepreneurs and technology innovators are pressuring local governments to adopt new forms of engagement with citizens; and third, new digital tools are emerging that can help make city services both more visible and more effective. Boston's experience in pursuing partnerships that facilitate opportunities for engaging citizens may provide scalable (and disruptive) lessons for other cities.

    During the summer of 2013, in anticipation of Mayor Menino's retirement in January 2014, Prof. Susan Crawford and Project Assistant Dana Walters carried out a case study examining the ongoing evolution of the Boston Mayor's Hotline into a platform for civic engagement. We chose this CRM focus because the initial development of the system provides a concrete example of how leaders in government can connect to local partners and citizens. In the course of this research, we interviewed 21 city employees and several of their partners outside government, and gathered data about the use of the system. (Exhibit A is a list of interviewees.)

    We found a traditional technology story — selection and integration of CRM software, initial performance management using that software, development of ancillary channels of communication, initial patterns of adoption and use — that reflects the commitment of Mayor Menino to personalized constituent service. We also found that that commitment, his long tenure, and the particular personalities of the people on the New Urban Mechanics team make this both a cultural story as well as a technology story. Here are the highlights: The combination of Mitchell Weiss's vision for citizen engagement, Nigel Jacob's expertise in software development and digital strategy, Chris Osgood's experience in navigating government bureaucracy, and Bill Oates's (CIO) private-sector experience has allowed this team to launch successful projects and build valuable partnerships that focus on citizen-centered innovation; Even without budgetary authority or staff, the innovation office within the Mayor's suite (the Office of New Urban Mechanics) has been able to nudge, encourage, and facilitate collaborations inside City Hall and across academic institutions, technologists, and other city governments that have been productive; As one example of the team's joint efforts and partnerships, both inside and outside City Hall, the launch of Boston's Lagan CRM system in October 2008 was followed by integration of the system into the operations of several constituent-facing service departments; The system has evolved over time to include, among other things, a mobile app for field workers in the Department of Public Works (City Worker), a smartphone app for citizens (Citizen Connect), reports that are useful for performance management, and several different channels through which citizens can interact with City Hall, while retaining its high-touch, personalized character; Although every CRM system case is assigned a case ID number, the CRM system as a whole does not automatically assign a unique identifier to citizens that would allow uniform tracking across different modes of contact (smartphone app, Web interface, phone call) or mapping of particular citizens to particular neighborhoods. Constituents who contact the system may voluntarily provide contact details (name, home address, email, and phone); Future versions of this system, and layering of CRM data over other City data (911, inspections, sensor data, social sentiment data, traffic data), could make possible much more extensive citizen collaboration, situation awareness, policy inputs, performance analysis, and co-creation of government services or policies. Although there are many channels for reporting into the CRM system — Citizens Connect, SMS, web chat, phone calls — all of the people reporting in are not connected to each other, and the lack of unique identifiers makes true "citizen relationship management" difficult. Customer satisfaction is also not measured by the system, as far as we can tell. Outbound calls, texting, and Twitter/social media sentiment mining might be useful tools for this assessment; Combining formal CRM requests with social sentiment information could provide useful guidance underpinning policy decisions and resource allocation. Connecting all of this information to job functions within City Hall would also clearly be productive. And if we believe that people in their communities know more about their communities than all the gifted people in City Hall, how do we enable them to help themselves solve some of their own problems? Boston City Hall has not been focused on predictive analytics or the public release of data; rather, the team's top priorities (in line with Mayor Menino's strategy) have been to improve service delivery and encourage citizen engagement; Mayor Menino's leadership style, strategic goals, and long tenure, together with the particular personalities of the members of the core team profiled in this study, have been essential to this narrative; The longterm effects on either the operation of City government or citizen engagement of the Office of New Urban Mechanics and the innovative, experimental ethos encouraged by that Office, Chief of Staff Mitchell Weiss, and CIO Bill Oates are unclear. Much will depend on the character and priorities of the new mayor.

  abstract: |-
    The availability and accessibility of open data has the potential to increase transparency and accountability and, in turn, the potential to improve the governance of universities as public institutions. In addition, it is suggested that open data is likely to increase the quality, efficacy and efficiency of research and analysis of the national higher education system by providing a shared empirical base for critical interrogation and reinterpretation. The Centre for Higher Education Transformation (CHET) has developed an online, open data platform providing institutional-level data on South African higher education. However, other than anecdotal feedback, little is known about how the data is being used. Using CHET as a case study, this project studied the use of the CHET open data initiative by university planners as well as by higher education studies researchers. It did so by considering the supply of and demand for open data as well as the roles of intermediaries in the South African higher education governance ecosystem.
    The study found that (i) CHET’s open data is being used by university planners and higher education studies researchers, albeit infrequently; (ii) the government’s higher education database is a closed and isolated data source in the data ecosystem; (iii) there are concerns at both government and university levels about how data will be used and (mis)interpreted; (iv) open data intermediaries increase the accessibility and utility of data; (v) open data intermediaries provide both supply-side as well as demand- side value; (vi) intermediaries may assume the role of a ‘keystone species’ in a data ecosystem; (vii) intermediaries have the potential to democratise the impacts and use of open data – intermediaries play an important role in curtailing the ‘de-ameliorating’ effects of data-driven disciplinary surveillance..
    The report concludes as follows: (i) despite poor data provision by government, the public university governance open data ecosystem has evolved because of the presence of intermediaries in the ecosystem; (ii) by providing a richer information context and/or by making the data interoperable, government could improve the uptake of data by new users and intermediaries, as well as by the existing intermediaries; and (iii) increasing the fluidity of government open data could remove uncertainties around both the degree of access provided by intermediaries and the financial sustainability of the open platforms provided by intermediaries.

    Advances in data analytics bring with them civil rights implications. Data-driven and algorithmic decision making increasingly determine how businesses target advertisements to consumers, how police departments monitor individuals or groups, how banks decide who gets a loan and who does not, how employers hire, how colleges and universities make admission and financial aid decisions, and much more. As data-driven decisions increasingly affect every corner of our lives, there is an urgent need to ensure they do not become instruments of discrimination, barriers to equality, threats to social justice, and sources of unfairness. In this paper, we argue for a concrete research agenda aimed at addressing these concerns, comprising five areas of emphasis:
    - Determining if models and modeling procedures exhibit objectionable bias
    - Building awareness of fairness into machine learning methods
    - Improving the transparency and control of data - and model-driven decision making
    - Looking beyond the algorithm(s) for sources of bias and unfairness - in the myriad human decisions made during the problem formulation and modeling process
    - Supporting the cross-disciplinary scholarship necessary to do all of that well

  abstract: While collective intelligence (CI) is a powerful approach to increase
    decision accuracy, few attempts have been made to unlock its potential in medical
    decision-making. Here we investigated the performance of three well-known collective
    intelligence rules (“majority”, “quorum”, and “weighted quorum”) when applied
    to mammography screening. For any particular mammogram, these rules aggregate
    the independent assessments of multiple radiologists into a single decision (recall
    the patient for additional workup or not). We found that, compared to single radiologists,
    any of these CI-rules both increases true positives (i.e., recalls of patients
    with cancer) and decreases false positives (i.e., recalls of patients without
    cancer), thereby overcoming one of the fundamental limitations to decision accuracy
    that individual radiologists face. Importantly, we find that all CI-rules systematically
    outperform even the best-performing individual radiologist in the respective group.
    Our findings demonstrate that CI can be employed to improve mammography screening;
    similarly, CI may have the potential to improve medical decision-making in a much
    wider range of contexts, including many areas of diagnostic imaging and, more
    generally, diagnostic decisions that are based on the subjective interpretation
    of evidence.

  abstract: |-
    Nowadays there is a multitude of mobile and tablet applications being developed in order to facilitate or disrupt every day tasks. Many of these are location based. A technique to serve in providing information and content is crowdsourcing. This technique is based on the public contributing information or resources giving them the opportunity to become both service providers and recipients at the same time.

    Taking into account the above and after observing passengers using the public transport system, we came to the conclusion that it would be useful to be able to determine which transport medium (i.e which bus line out of a number running concurrently) is nearer at any given moment. This information allows for better decision making and choice of transportation.

    For this we propose the development of an application to show the position of a selected transport vehicle. The position will be calculated based on geo-tracking provided by passengers boarded on a vehicle. This will allow for real time information to the application users in order to be able to determine their optimal route.

  abstract: |-
    The inclusion of social participation concerns in public policies in Brazil reflects a contemporary approach to democracy, according to which modern citizens should be able to contribute to the creation of laws and policies, as well as contribute with states in their implementation. This State of the Art report aims to provide an overview of the normative and institutional state of art of ICT-mediated citizen participation in Brazil. The first section provides an overview of the political and civic liberties framework in Brazil. In the second section the landscape of ICT-mediated citizen engagement is mapped. In the third section, the report engages with implications of technology mediations for deliberative democracy and transformative citizenship.

    The study argues that the discussion around participation (and e-participation) has dimmed in the last few years in Brazil. It could be a consequence of the current crises in the democratic system that we face today, the diminishing presence of social movements as effective members of government and the lack of proper institutionalisation of forms of online participation.

  abstract: By building on progress that has been made and effectively utilizing the
    tools and levers in the federal government, the next administration can institutionalize
    the use of technology to enhance government innovation and effectiveness. The
    transition teams can accelerate these efforts by thinking strategically about
    how to implement an innovation agenda within agencies and through government-wide
    initiatives. The transition team can also make innovation a priority in the selection
    of appointees and in providing a clear agenda for action.

    the Big Data debate, such as privacy concerns and human resource scarcity, are
    aggravated in developing countries by long-standing structural shortages in the
    areas of infrastructure, economic resources and institutions. The result is a
    new kind of digital divide: a divide in the use of data-based knowledge to inform
    intelligent decision-making. The article systematically reviews several available
    policy options in terms of fostering opportunities and minimising risks.'

  abstract: Perfect anonymization of data sets has failed. But the process of protecting
    data subjects in shared information remains integral to privacy practice and policy.
    While the deidentification debate has been vigorous and productive, there is no
    clear direction for policy. As a result, the law has been slow to adapt a holistic
    approach to protecting data subjects when data sets are released to others. Currently,
    the law is focused on whether an individual can be identified within a given set.
    We argue that the better locus of data release policy is on the process of minimizing
    the risk of reidentification and sensitive attribute disclosure. Process-based
    data release policy, which resembles the law of data security, will help us move
    past the limitations of focusing on whether data sets have been “anonymized.”
    It draws upon different tactics to protect the privacy of data subjects, including
    accurate deidentification rhetoric, contracts prohibiting reidentification and
    sensitive attribute disclosure, data enclaves, and query-based strategies to match
    required protections with the level of risk. By focusing on process, data release
    policy can better balance privacy and utility where nearly all data exchanges
    carry some risk.

  abstract: 'When sexual violence is a product of organized crime or social imaginary,
    the links between sexual violence episodes can be understood as a latent structure.
    With this assumption in place, we can use data science to uncover complex patterns.
    In this paper we focus on the use of data mining techniques to unveil complex
    anomalous spatio-temporal patterns of sexual violence. We illustrate their use
    by analyzing all reported rapes in El Salvador over a period of nine years. Through
    our analysis, we are able to provide evidence of phenomena that,to the best of
    our knowledge,have not been previously reported in literature. We devote special
    attention to a pattern we discover in the East, where underage victims report
    their boyfriends as perpetrators at anomalously high rates. Finally, we explain
    how such analyzes could be conducted in real-time, enabling early detection of
    emerging patterns to allow law enforcement agencies and policy makers to react
    accordingly. '

  abstract: |-
    Two of the central challenges in building accountability for marginalised people are how to reach and meaningfully involve the most excluded, and how to establish the kinds of relationships that mean they can achieve, influence and expect government responsiveness.

    This report explores how participatory video – an existing methodology for engaging marginalised people – can be adapted and strengthened inclusively to engage citizens and foster responses from decision-makers. It presents four propositions for achieving this:
    - Proposition 1: ensure inclusive engagement during group-forming and building
    - Proposition 2: develop shared purpose and group agency through video exploration and sense-making
    - Proposition 3: enable horizontal scaling through community-level videoing action
    - Proposition 4: support the performance of vertical influence through video-mediated communication.

    Each of these propositions is discussed in relation to three concepts that are important elements of accountability initiatives: enabling spaces, bonding and bridging communication, and power-shifting. The discussion draws on two long-term participatory video processes at five sites in two countries, Kenya and Indonesia.

  abstract: In January 2011, mass demonstrations in Tunisia ousted a regime that had
    tolerated little popular participation, opening the door to a new era of transparency.
    The protesters demanded an end to the secrecy that had protected elite privilege.
    Five months later, the president issued a decree that increased citizen access
    to government data and formed a steering committee to guide changes in information
    practices, building on small projects already in development. Advocates in the
    legislature and the public service joined with civil society leaders to support
    a strong access-to-information policy, to change the culture of public administration,
    and to secure the necessary financial and technical resources to publish large
    quantities of data online in user-friendly formats. Several government agencies
    launched their own open-data websites. External pressure, coupled with growing
    interest from civil society and legislators, helped keep transparency reforms
    on the cabinet office agenda despite frequent changes in top leadership. In 2016,
    Tunisia adopted one of the world’s strongest laws regarding access to information.
    Although members of the public did not put all of the resources to use immediately,
    the country moved much closer to having the data needed to improve access to services,
    enhance government performance, and support the evidence-based deliberation on
    which a healthy democracy depended.

  abstract: This paper explores the use of a spatio-temporal approach to small area
    estimation for improving understanding of attitudes to policing. The study focusing
    on confidence in the police in London using sample survey data. The Public Attitudes
    Survey (PAS) collects data on the experiences and perceptions of Londoners with
    respect to crime, policing and anti-social behavior.  While the most robust survey
    of its kind in the world, it is not designed for use at the neighborhood level
    but rather to produce annual, Borough level estimates on a rolling average basis.
    However, there is a demand for reliable, local level data for quarterly assessment
    and planning. In this study, we present a Bayesian spatio-temporal hierarchical
    modeling approach to small area estimation to address this. In this approach,
    information is “borrowed” from neighboring regions in space and time to increase
    effective sample size. This enables reliable estimates, forecasts and classification
    of trends in confidence at the neighborhood-level.

  abstract: 'This paper develops and tests a theoretical model, which assesses the
    commitment of cities to the concept of open government data (OGD), according to
    three levels. Level 1, ‘Way of life,’ reflects a high commitment to OGD; Level
    2, ‘On the Fence,’ represents either a low or erratic commitment to OGD; Level
    3, ‘Lip Service,’ refers to either scarce or no commitment to OGD. These levels
    draw on four key dimensions: 1) Rhythm; 2) Span of Issues; 3) Disclosure; and
    4) Feedback. We empirically examine this theoretical framework using longitudinal
    mixed-method analysis of the OGD behavior of 16 US cities for a period of four
    years, using a large novel corpus of municipal OGD metadata, as well as primary
    qualitative and secondary quantitative indicators. This methodology allows us
    to represent, for the first time, the evolving OGD commitment — or “OGD heart
    beat” — of cities.'

  abstract: This book presents cutting edge research on the new ethical challenges
    posed by biomedical Big Data technologies and practices. ‘Biomedical Big Data’
    refers to the analysis of aggregated, very large datasets to improve medical knowledge
    and clinical care. The book describes the ethical problems posed by aggregation
    of biomedical datasets and re-use/re-purposing of data, in areas such as privacy,
    consent, professionalism, power relationships, and ethical governance of Big Data
    platforms. Approaches and methods are discussed that can be used to address these
    problems to achieve the appropriate balance between the social goods of biomedical
    Big Data research and the safety and privacy of individuals. Seventeen original
    contributions analyse the ethical, social and related policy implications of the
    analysis and curation of biomedical Big Data, written by leading experts in the
    areas of biomedical research, medical and technology ethics, privacy, governance
    and data protection. The book advances our understanding of the ethical conundrums
    posed by biomedical Big Data, and shows how practitioners and policy-makers can
    address these issues going forward.

  abstract: Research on open innovation suggests that companies benefit differentially
    from adopting open innovation strategies; however, it is unclear why this is so.
    One possible explanation is that companies’ business models are not attuned to
    open strategies. Accordingly, we propose a contingency model of open business
    models by systematically linking open innovation strategies to core business model
    dimensions, notably the content, structure, governance of transactions. We further
    illustrate a continuum of open innovativeness, differentiating between four types
    of open business models. We contribute to the open innovation literature by specifying
    the conditions under which business models are conducive to the success of open
    innovation strategies.

  abstract: The Computational Propaganda Research Project at the Oxford Internet Institute,
    University of Oxford, has researched the use of social media for public opinion
    manipulation. The team involved 12 researchers across nine countries who, altogether,
    inverviewed 65 experts, analyzed tens of millions of posts on seven different
    social media platforms during scores of elections, political crises, and national
    security incidents. Each case study analyzed qualitative, quantitative, and computational
    evidence collected between 2015 and 2017 from Brazil, Canada, China, Germany,
    Poland, Taiwan, Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. Computational propaganda
    is the use of algorithms, automation, and human curation to purposefully distribute
    misleading information over social media networks. We find several distinct global
    trends in computational propaganda.

  abstract: |-
    Today, governments have access to a variety of tools to successfully implement agency programs. For example, Data Analytics—especially of financial data—can be used to better inform decision making by ensuring agencies have the information they need at the point of time that it can be most effective. In addition, governments at all levels can more effectively address risks using new Risk Management approaches. And finally, Shared Services can not only save money, but also stimulate innovation, improve decisionmaking, and increase the quality of services expected by citizens.

    The IBM Center has published a variety of reports related to these topics and accordingly, we have brought key findings on these topics together in the compilation that follows. We welcome your thoughts on these issues, and look forward to a continued dialogue with government leaders and stakeholders on actions to help agencies achieve their mission effectively and efficiently.

  abstract: 'Developing and commercializing novel ideas is central to innovation processes.
    As the outcome of such ideas cannot fully be foreseen, the evaluation of them
    is crucial. With the rise of the internet and ICT, more and new kinds of evaluations
    are done by crowds. This raises the question whether individuals in crowds possess
    necessary capabilities to evaluate and whether their outcomes are valid. As empirical
    insights are not yet available, this paper deals with the examination of evaluation
    processes and general evaluation components, the discussion of underlying characteristics
    and mechanism of these components affecting evaluation outcomes (i.e. evaluation
    validity). We further investigate differences between firm- and crowd-based evaluation
    using different cases of applications, and develop a theoretical framework towards
    evaluation validity, i.e. validity by numbers vs. the validity by expertise. The
    identified factors that influence the validity of evaluations are: (1) the number
    of evaluation tasks, (2) complexity, (3) expertise, (4) costs, and (5) time to
    outcome. For each of these factors, hypotheses are developed based on theoretical
    arguments. We conclude with implications, proposing a model of evaluation validity.'

    It examines the most prominent epistemological claims made by Big Data proponents,
    calls action to the potential socio-political consequences of blind data trust,
    and proposes a possible way forward. The paper''s main focus is on the interplay
    between an emerging new empiricism and an increasingly opaque algorithmic environment
    that challenges democratic demands for transparency and accountability. It concludes
    that responsible culture of quantification requires epistemic vigilance as well
    as a greater awareness of the potential dangers and ptifalls of an ever more data-driven

  abstract: 'In the recessionary years following the 2008 financial crisis, prominent
    voices predicted an imminent crisis in state and municipal finances. The voices
    – including Bill Gates, Josh Ruah, Meredith Whitney, Paul Volcker, and Richard
    Ravitch – declared or implied that the road to fiscal responsibility lies in reining
    in the pensions and benefits of public servants. We argue that painting public
    employees as villains introduces divisiveness in what should be a universal goal
    of sound public finances. We suggest that the road to fiscal responsibility lies
    with budgetary transparency and widespread public knowledge of state and municipal
    finances. A potential key to achieving these objectives is participatory budgeting.
    We motivate a research question on the local government level: Does participatory
    budgeting increase transparency? Although it is too early to test this question
    on the local level, we use country-level data from the International Budgetary
    Partnership to explore ways to operationalize budgetary transparency in order
    to measure the association between participatory budgeting and budgetary transparency.'

  abstract: Government legislation and calls for greater levels of oversight and transparency
    are leading public bodies to publish their raw datasets online. Policy makers
    and elected officials anticipate that the accessibility of open data through online
    Government portals for citizens will enable public engagement in policy making
    through increased levels of fact based content elicited from open data. The usability
    and benefits of such open data are being argued as contributing positively towards
    public sector reforms, which are under extreme pressures driven by extended periods
    of austerity. However, there is very limited scholarly studies that have attempted
    to empirically evaluate the performance of government open data websites and the
    acceptance and use of these data from a citizen perspective. Given this research
    void, an adjusted diffusion of innovation model based on Rogers’ diffusion of
    innovations theory (DOI) is proposed and used in this paper to empirically determine
    the predictors influencing the use of public sector open data. A good understanding
    of these predictors affecting the acceptance and use of open data will likely
    assist policy makers and public administrations in determining the policy instruments
    that can increase the acceptance and use of open data through an active promotion
    campaign to engage-contribute-use.

  abstract: Open source represents a model generally known for its success in software
    production. The objective of this article is to establish a new strategic approach
    of using open source development principles for managing collaborative arrangements
    between citizens and public administration. The identity of open source governance
    is developed by highlighting how it is different from its main “competitor”—collaborative
    governance, and from other two popular concepts—open government and e-democracy.
    The other sections are designed to answer to public managers regarding why and
    what to adopt from this governance model for public sector services.

  abstract: The widespread availability of high-quality Web-based content offers new
    potential for supporting teachers as designers of curricula and classroom activities.
    When coupled with a participatory Web culture and infrastructure, teachers can
    share their creations as well as leverage from the best that their peers have
    to offer to support a collective intelligence or crowdsourcing community, which
    we dubcrowdteaching. We applied a collective intelligence framework to characterize
    crowdteaching in the context of a Web-based tool for teachers called the Instructional
    Architect (IA). The IA enables teachers to find, create, and share instructional
    activities (called IA projects) for their students using online learning resources.
    These IA projects can further be viewed, copied, or adapted by other IA users.
    This study examines the usage activities of two samples of teachers, and also
    analyzes the characteristics of a subset of their IA projects. Analyses of teacher
    activities suggest that they are engaging in crowdteaching processes. Teachers,
    on average, chose to share over half of their IA projects, and copied some directly
    from other IA projects. Thus, these teachers can be seen as both contributors
    to and consumers of crowdteaching processes. In addition, IA users preferred to
    view IA projects rather than to completely copy them. Finally, correlational results
    based on an analysis of the characteristics of IA projects suggest that several
    easily computed metrics (number of views, number of copies, and number of words
    in IA projects) can act as an indirect proxy of instructionally relevant indicators
    of the content of IA projects.

  abstract: Every day, millions of users reveal their interests on Facebook, which
    are then monetized via targeted advertisement marketing campaigns. In this paper,
    we explore the use of demographically rich Facebook Ads audience estimates for
    tracking non-communicable diseases around the world. Across 47 countries, we compute
    the audience of marketer interests, and evaluate their potential in tracking health
    conditions associated with tobacco use, obesity, and diabetes, compared to the
    performance of placebo interests. Despite its huge potential, we find that, for
    modeling prevalence of health conditions across countries, differences in these
    interest audiences are only weakly indicative of the corresponding prevalence
    rates. Within the countries, however, our approach provides interesting insights
    on trends of health awareness across demographic groups. Finally, we provide a
    temporal error analysis to expose the potential pitfalls of using Facebook's Marketing
    API as a black box.

  abstract: Public  organizations  have  interacted  with  citizens  through increasingly  sophisticated  internet-enabled  technology.  Participatory
    platforms  emerged  from  Web  2.0  technologies  in  the  mid-2000s  as  a governance
    mechanism to  engage  citizens in the process of  effecting  social change.  Although  the  potential  of  platforms  is  recognized,  its  successful
    implementation has faced challenges. To begin to get a handle on how to best design  and  manage  participatory  platforms,  we  conducted  an  exploratory
    participatory  action  research  study  grounded  in  two  events  –  The  Policy
    Challenge and NSF Workshop on Participatory Platforms with a Public Intent. Both
    events  communed  practitioners,  scholars,  and citizen participants with diverse
    experience and expertise conducting and researching platforms. The insights  expressed  through  the
    events  and  follow-up  interviews  and  online survey  informed  our  development  of  a  participatory  platform  lifecycle  and
    design framework to assist designing successful participatory platforms.

  abstract: 'This study titled “Ebola: A Big Data Disaster” by Sean Martin McDonald,
    undertaken with support from the Open Society Foundation, Ford Foundation, and
    Media Democracy Fund, explores the use of Big Data in the form of Call Detail
    Record (CDR) data in humanitarian crisis. It discusses the challenges of digital
    humanitarian coordination in health emergencies like the Ebola outbreak in West
    Africa, and the marked tension in the debate around experimentation with humanitarian
    technologies and the impact on privacy. McDonald’s research focuses on the two
    primary legal and human rights frameworks, privacy and property, to question the
    impact of unregulated use of CDR’s on human rights. It also highlights how the
    diffusion of data science to the realm of international development constitutes
    a genuine opportunity to bring powerful new tools to fight crisis and emergencies.'

    lessons to be learned in how to embed such innovations within a wider and more
    diverse environment. Civic technologies in New Zealand and Australia, whilst operating
    at a lower-volume scale, operate within an environment of greater ethnic diversity

    only solidifies the legitimacy of such platforms as genuinely democratic tools,
    it ensures that a broad spectrum of interests and issues within communities are
    catered for equally by government agencies. \n\nmySociety’s long-term mission
    is to understand the impacts of civic technologies. To do that, we need to understand
    how we can engage everyone in society, not just digital enthusiasts. This research
    sought to examine how civic technologies in New Zealand and Australia are used,
    and how the structural political, educational and digital environment contributes
    to the use of civic technologies by diverse communities.\n"

  abstract: |-
    So far neither regulatory frameworks nor endeavours to develop bottom-up approaches to data protection have had much success in mitigating the moral hazard inherent in pervasive use of seemingly innocuous, “leaked data”. This paper focuses on two aspects of those risks that are too rarely discussed. They relate to the possibility of civic responsibility (1) and moral equality (2).

    (1) Ethical agency (and the responsibility it entails) presupposes the possibility of change: when our practices are wanting, someone needs to be able to stand up and question them. Change, in turn, presupposes the ability to break from habitual frames of thought. To what extent is the profilebased tailoring of the environmental architecture that shapes our choices and attitudes hampering the possibility of civic responsibility? The question at stake here is different from the betterknown “right to be forgotten” issue: the latter focuses on the impact of recorded data on others’ perception of oneself. This paper, by contrast, focuses on what may be called the “anchoring effect”: the impact of recorded data on our ability to see the world -and, most importantly, our role in it- differently. The ability to acknowledge a discrepancy between one’s present ethical stand and the person one seeks to be is essential to making sense of any notion of civic responsibility. The danger is that such discrepancy will simply cease to arise in an environment that has been systematically “optimized” in accordance to one’s profile.

    (2) The second section of this paper explores the extent to which ubiquitous, proactive computing gives rise to a very particular type of vulnerability, one that potentially threatens the moral equality of data-subjects. This vulnerability cannot be addressed by correcting epistemic imbalances. The current regulatory focus on information disclosure has obscured what mere disclosure cannot achieve: empowering data subjects to maintain and develop their sense of self. This may sound overly ambitious. I argue that it is no more so than a commitment to retain a meaningful, practice-relevant concept of civic responsibility.

  abstract: "Cities hold considerable information, including details about the daily
    lives of residents and employees, maps of critical infrastructure, and records
    of the officials’ internal deliberations. Cities are beginning to realize that
    this data has economic and other value: If done wisely, the responsible release
    of city information can also release greater efficiency and innovation in the
    public and private sector. New services are cropping up that leverage open city
    data to great effect. \n\nMeanwhile, activist groups and individual residents
    are placing increasing pressure on state and local government to be more transparent
    and accountable, even as others sound an alarm over the privacy issues that inevitably
    attend greater data promiscuity. This takes the form of political pressure to
    release more information, as well as increased requests for information under
    the many public records acts across the country. \n\nThe result of these forces
    is that cities are beginning to open their data as never before. It turns out
    there is surprisingly little research to date into the important and growing area
    of municipal open data. This article is among the first sustained, cross-disciplinary
    assessments of an open municipal government system. We are a team of researchers
    in law, computer science, information science, and urban studies. We have worked
    hand-in-hand with the City of Seattle, Washington for the better part of a year
    to understand its current procedures from each disciplinary perspective. Based
    on this empirical work, we generate a set of recommendations to help the city
    manage risk latent in opening its data.\n\n"

  abstract: The research deals primarily with the research question – How can engagement
    of civil society organizations with open government data be instigated or enhanced?
    To answer the question, an action research was conducted in two provinces in the
    Philippines where civil society organizations in Negros Oriental province were
    trained, and in the Bohol province were mentored on accessing and using open government
    data. The research showed that for capacity building programs to be effective,
    they should be relevant to the condition of the CSOs and the individual needs
    of learners; conducted with a long-term view of ensuring use and actual impact
    not only on the organization but also on the constituencies that they serve; focused
    on higher-order results like changes in practices and behavior of organizations
    and their staff members or the actual production of outputs that benefits citizens
    and communities; and targeted to achieve whole-of-organization awareness, appreciation,
    and motivation to use data. This paper asserts that short-term, sporadic, one-time
    buzz trainings, or off-the-shelf training programs, currently the prevailing modes
    of capacity building delivery, will not yield to actual data use that will show
    the economic, political, and social power of open data.

  abstract: 'An increase in innovation contests and their associated prizes have been
    observed since the 90s especially in the US through the sponsorship of the American
    Federal Agencies. The purpose of this article is to shed light on some of the
    direct and indirect effects of US federal agency contests not only on economic
    dynamics but also social dynamics. Based on recent case studies, this paper describes
    the various positive impacts that federal agency contests may have: Contests may
    display a strong incentive effect ex-ante and during the contest; they may produce
    favorable spillovers after the contests, at innovation and economic levels in
    specified economic/ industry sectors; and they may also play a beneficial social
    role, contributing to citizens'' education and awareness. Nevertheless, as a contest
    remains a sophisticated device, public decision makers must comply with certain
    requirements if they wish to benefit from this particular policy tool in order
    to spur innovation.'

  - Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing Countries
  git_hub: ''
  abstract: 'Open data have the potential to improve the governance of universities
    as public institutions. In addition, open data are likely to increase the quality,
    efficacy and efficiency of the research and analysis of higher education systems
    by providing a shared empirical base for critical interrogation and reinterpretation.
    Drawing on research conducted by the Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing
    Countries project, and using an ecosystems approach, this research paper considers
    the supply, demand and use of open data as well as the roles of intermediaries
    in the governance of South African public higher education. It shows that government''s
    higher education database is a closed and isolated data source in the data ecosystem;
    and that the open data that are made available by government is inaccessible and
    rarely used. In contrast, government data made available by data intermediaries
    in the ecosystem are being used by key stakeholders. Intermediaries are found
    to play several important roles in the ecosystem: (i) they increase the accessibility
    and utility of data; (ii) they may assume the role of a “keystone species” in
    a data ecosystem; and (iii) they have the potential to democratize the impacts
    and use of open data. The article concludes that despite poor data provision by
    government, the public university governance open data ecosystem has evolved because
    intermediaries in the ecosystem have reduced the viscosity of government data.
    Further increasing the fluidity of government open data will improve access and
    ensure the sustainability of open data supply in the ecosystem.'

    Information and communication technologies (ICTs) and mHealth innovations hold great potential to improve health systems and health outcomes while at the same time enhancing citizen engagement and accountability. Yet there has been little assessment of the impact of mHealth innovations on the ground.

    This paper reviews the experiences of seven mHealth initiatives funded by the Making All Voices Count programme: OurHealth, eThekwini WACs and Thuthuzela Voices (all in South Africa), Mobile Mapping for Women’s Health (Tanzania), Text2Speak (Nigeria), SMS Gateway (Indonesia), and Citizen Journalism for Quality Governance of Universal Health Insurance Scheme (also Indonesia). The authors discuss the accountability model adopted by each project, and the challenges they faced.

    societal issues and problems. A key supporting aim was to develop a\ntransparent
    and replicable set of tools for measuring the impact of these sites that would
    help to\ndevelop a ‘best practice’ for mySociety and other ‘e-democracy’ organizations
    in evaluating their\nsocietal impact. The report provides a summary of the work

  abstract: 'This article shows how activists in the open data movement re-articulate
    notions of democracy, participation, and journalism by applying practices and
    values from open source culture to the creation and use of data. Focusing on the
    Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews
    and content analysis, it argues that this process leads activists to develop new
    rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied publics.
    Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a
    prerequisite for generating knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source
    code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should break the interpretative
    monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation
    of data about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and
    flexible form of representative democracy by applying the open source model of
    participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermediaries
    are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an
    interest in transforming journalism to become an intermediary in this sense. At
    the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic
    technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting
    that the practices and ideas of open data activists are relevant because they
    illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help
    to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors
    outside big government and big business.'

    Transformative technological changes are shaping the world and unleashing unprecedented volumes of data. Transport is a key generator of emerging data and also stands to be a
    significant beneficiary of new products, services, insights and ways of working that accompany this. Emerging data will mean transport users will become far more fully informed about their travel choices whilst at the same time transform the ability of transport authorities to plan and manage transport networks and services more efficiently and effectively. The purpose of this report is to outline key challenges and opportunities from the perspective of city region transport authorities, and to articulate a case for action.

  abstract: 'This paper, drawing on author engagement with smart city development
    in Glasgow as well as the results of an international conference in the area curated
    by the author, argues that smart cities combine the three greatest current threats
    to personal privacy, with which regulation has so far failed to deal effectively;
    the Internet of Things(IoT) or "ubiquitous computing"; "Big Data" ; and the Cloud.
    While these three phenomena have been examined extensively in much privacy literature
    (particularly the last two), both in the US and EU, the combination is under-explored.
    Furthermore, US legal literature and solutions (if any) are not simply transferable
    to the EU because of the US''s lack of an omnibus data protection (DP) law. I
    will discuss how and if EU DP law controls possible threats to personal privacy
    from smart cities and suggest further research on two possible solutions: one,
    a mandatory holistic privacy impact assessment (PIA) exercise for smart cities:
    two, code solutions for flagging the need for, and consequences of, giving consent
    to collection of data in ambient environments.'

  abstract: 'The powerful potential of digital media to engage citizens in political
    actions has now crossed our news screens many times. But scholarly focus has tended
    to be on "networked," anti-institutional forms of collective action, to the neglect
    of advocacy and service organizations. This book investigates the changing fortunes
    of the citizen-civil society relationship by exploring how social changes and
    innovations in communication technology are transforming the information expectations
    and preferences of many citizens, especially young citizens. In doing so, it is
    the first work to bring together theories of civic identity change with research
    on civic organizations. Specifically, it argues that a shift in "information styles"
    may help to explain the disjuncture felt by many young people when it comes to
    institutional participation and politics. The book theorizes two paradigms of
    information style: a dutiful style, which was rooted in the society, communication
    system and citizen norms of the modern era, and an actualizing style, which constitutes
    the set of information practices and expectations of the young citizens of late
    modernity for whom interactive digital media are the norm. Hypothesizing that
    civil society institutions have difficulty adapting to the norms and practices
    of the actualizing information style, two empirical studies apply the dutiful/actualizing
    framework to innovative content analyses of organizations'' online communications-on
    their websites, and through Facebook. Results demonstrate that with intriguing
    exceptions, most major civil society organizations use digital media more in line
    with dutiful information norms than actualizing ones: they tend to broadcast strategic
    messages to an audience of receivers, rather than encouraging participation or
    exchange among an active set of participants. The book concludes with a discussion
    of the tensions inherent in bureaucratic organizations trying to adapt to an actualizing
    information style, and recommendations for how they may more successfully do so.'

  abstract: New technology may offer many opportunities for humanitarian action, but
    it also presents a number of challenges. Currently, most of the critical analysis
    of these potential challenges takes place in the blogosphere, on tweets and on
    listservs. There is a strong need for more scholarly engagement on the subject.
    This article offers an agenda for critical inquiry into the emergent field of
    humanitarian technology as applied to a broadly defined context of crises, encompassing
    both natural disasters and conflict zones, by identifying what technology does
    to the humanitarian enterprise, and by reflecting on the key challenges that emerge.

    In this report, Professor Greenberg examines a dozen cities across the United States that have award-winning reputations for using innovation and technology to improve the services they provide to their residents. She explores a variety of success factors associated with effective service delivery at the local level, including:
    -The policies, platforms, and applications that cities use for different purposes, such as public engagement, streamlining the issuance of permits, and emergency response
    -How cities can successfully partner with third parties, such as nonprofits, foundations, universities, and private businesses to improve service delivery using technology
    -The types of business cases that can be presented to mayors and city councils to support various changes proposed by innovators in city government

  abstract: |-
    Innovation is a key driver in organizational sustainability, and yes, openness and transparency are a recipe for innovation. But, according to Tapscott and Williams, “when it comes to innovation, competitive advantage and organizational success, ‘openness’ is rarely the first word one would use to describe companies and other societal organizations like government agencies or medical institutions. For many, words like ‘insular,’ ‘bureaucratic,’ ‘hierarchical,’ ‘secretive’ and ‘closed’ come to mind instead.”1 And yet a few months ago, The Tesla Model S just became the world's first open-source car. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motor Vehicles, shared all the patents on Tesla's electric car technology, allowing anyone — including competitors — to use them without fear of litigation. Elon wrote in his post “Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology.”2
    In the public sector, terms such as open government, citizen sourcing, and wiki government are also akin to the notion of open innovation and transparency. As Hilgers and Ihl report, “a good example of this approach is the success of the Future Melbourne program, a Wiki and blog-based approach to shaping the future urban landscape of Australia’s second largest city. The program allowed citizens to directly edit and comment on the plans for the future development of the city. It attracted more than 30,000 individuals, who submitted hundreds of comments and suggestions (futuremelbourne.com.au). Basically, problems concerning design and creativity, future strategy and local culture, and even questions of management and service innovation can be broadcasted on such web-platforms.”3 The authors suggest that there are three dimensions to applying the concept of open innovation to the public sector: citizen ideation and innovation (tapping knowledge and creativity), collaborative administration (user generated new tasks and processes), and collaborative democracy (improve public participation in the policy process).

  abstract: "Traditional analyses of global security cannot explain the degree to
    which there is \"governance\" of important security issues -- from combatting
    piracy to curtailing nuclear proliferation to reducing the contributions of extractive
    industries to violence and conflict. They are even less able to explain why contemporary
    governance schemes involve the various actors and take the many forms they do.
    \n\nJuxtaposing the insights of scholars writing about new modes of governance
    with the logic of network theory, The New Power Politics offers a framework for
    understanding contemporary security governance and its variation. The framework
    rests on a fresh view of power and how it works in global politics. Though power
    is integral to governance, it is something that emerges from, and depends on,
    relationships. Thus, power is dynamic; it is something that governors must continually
    cultivate with a wide range of consequential global players, and how a governor
    uses power in one situation can have consequences for her future relationships,
    and thus, future power. \n\nUnderstanding this new power politics is crucial for
    explaining and shaping the future of global security politics. This stellar group
    of scholars analyzes both the networking strategies of would-be governors and
    their impacts on the effectiveness of governance and whether it reflects broad
    or narrow concerns on a wide range of contemporary governance issues."

  abstract: The generation of large-scale biomedical data is creating unprecedented
    opportunities for basic and translational science. Typically, the data producers
    perform initial analyses, but it is very likely that the most informative methods
    may reside with other groups. Crowdsourcing the analysis of complex and massive
    data has emerged as a framework to find robust methodologies. When the crowdsourcing
    is done in the form of collaborative scientific competitions, known as Challenges,
    the validation of the methods is inherently addressed. Challenges also encourage
    open innovation, create collaborative communities to solve diverse and important
    biomedical problems, and foster the creation and dissemination of well-curated
    data repositories.

  abstract: Natural disasters affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide every
    year. Emergency response efforts depend upon the availability of timely information,
    such as information concerning the movements of affected populations. The analysis
    of aggregated and anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) captured from the mobile
    phone infrastructure provides new possibilities to characterize human behavior
    during critical events. In this work, we investigate the viability of using CDR
    data combined with other sources of information to characterize the floods that
    occurred in Tabasco, Mexico in 2009. An impact map has been reconstructed using
    Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within this frame, the underlying communication
    activity signals in the CDR data have been analyzed and compared against rainfall
    levels extracted from data of the NASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number
    of active phones connected to each cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns
    in the most affected locations during and after the floods that could be used
    as signatures of the floods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment
    and population information awareness. The representativeness of the analysis has
    been assessed using census data and civil protection records. While a more extensive
    validation is required, these early results suggest high potential in using cell
    tower activity information to improve early warning and emergency management mechanisms.

  abstract: Given the promise of open data – that is, the potential of open data to
    increase the credibility of institutions in the eyes of citizens through greater
    the transparency and greater accountability – we would suggest that the open data
    movement needs to develop a more nuanced understanding of how to institutionalise
    open data practices, particularly if open data practice is to become an enduring
    and taken-for-granted course of action by government agencies. While useful as
    mapping exercises, current enabler and barrier analyses on open data have not,
    we believe, drilled deep enough to provide reliable insights sensitive to the
    implementation context. There have undoubtedly been early successes on the open
    data supply side, but these successes are not yet unquali ed successes; questions
    remain regarding the sustainability of open data supply and about how ubiquitous
    supply is across government organisations. In the African context, there are fewer
    large-scale success stories, although there is evidence of commitments to opening
    up government data and of open data portals at state and/or regional government
    levels.

    "Proponents of electronic rulemaking proposals designed to
    enhance ordinary citizens’ involvement in the rulemaking process
    have debated with skeptics the question of whether such initiatives will
    actually increase citizens’ involvement. In the debate thus far,
    however, proponents have largely assumed the desirability of such
    involvement, and skeptics have usually not challenged that
    assumption. In addition, proponents and skeptics have focused on the
    relationship between agencies and individuals, failing to consider the
    larger administrative law context—and in particular the role played
    by Congress and the courts. This Article considers e-rulemaking in a
    broader institutional context and directly addresses the desirability of
    the proposed e-rulemaking initiatives. The Article finds that there are
    good reasons to believe that e-rulemaking initiatives’ costs outweigh their benefits, but that it would be premature to settle on that conclusion. The Article ultimately advocates modest experimentation with e-rulemaking, both to allow for further evaluation of e-rulemaking and to provide additional data about the rulemaking process more generally.

  abstract: The prevalence of mobile communication in the developing world is ever
    increasing, with now 89 active subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. With this access
    comes the potential for unprecedented insights into individuals and societies,
    such as migration patterns, economic transactions, and even importation routes
    of infectious diseases like Ebola. However, the absence of a common framework
    for sharing mobile phone data in privacy-conscientious ways and an uncertain regulatory
    landscape has made difficult scientists' utilization of this powerful data. In
    the latest paper in our Issues in Technology Innovation series, Yves-Alexandre
    de Montjoye, Jake Kendall, and Cameron F. Kerry explore important case studies
    that have uncovered valuable insights into understanding the spread of infectious
    diseases as well as strategies into micro-target outreach and driving update of
    health-seeking behavior. The authors argue for a more nuanced approach in protecting
    privacy related to mobile data, building a case for special exceptions made where
    data may be used for significant public good or to avoid serious harm to people.

    Social media are now widely used for political protests, campaigns, and communication in developed and developing nations, but available research has not yet paid sufficient attention to experiences beyond the US and UK. This collection tackles this imbalance head-on, compiling cutting-edge research across six continents to provide a comprehensive, global, up-to-date review of recent political uses of social media.

    Drawing together empirical analyses of the use of social media by political movements and in national and regional elections and referenda, The Routledge Companion to Social Media and Politics presents studies ranging from Anonymous and the Arab Spring to the Greek Aganaktismenoi, and from South Korean presidential elections to the Scottish independence referendum. The book is framed by a selection of keystone theoretical contributions, evaluating and updating existing frameworks for the social media age.

  abstract: Collective intelligence is much talked about but remains very underdeveloped
    as a field. There are small pockets in computer science and psychology and fragments
    in other fields, ranging from economics to biology. New networks and social media
    also provide a rich source of emerging evidence. However, there are surprisingly
    few useable theories, and many of the fashionable claims have not stood up to
    scrutiny. The field of analysis should be how intelligence is organised at large
    scale—in organisations, cities, nations and networks. The paper sets out some
    of the potential theoretical building blocks, suggests an experimental and research
    agenda, shows how it could be analysed within an organisation or business sector
    and points to the possible intellectual barriers to progress.

  abstract: |-
    Governments sometimes complain that the budget information they make publicly available is seldom accessed and utilized. On the other hand, civil society organizations (CSOs) often claim that the information governments make available is very difficult to understand and not detailed enough to allow for meaningful analysis and advocacy. Is there a mismatch between the budget information supplied by governments and demand among civil society?

    This paper examines the “demand side” of fiscal transparency using findings from a global survey of 176 individuals working in civil society that use budget information for analysis and advocacy activities. Based on the responses, the authors identify a “fiscal transparency effectiveness gap” between the fiscal information that governments often provide and the information that CSOs need.

    These findings are used to develop a set of recommendations to help governments ensure their transparency practices deliver increased citizen engagement, improved oversight, and enhanced accountability.

  abstract: 'Our goal is formulating policies and developing guidelines that create
    a more resilient and healthier Department of Computer Science at University College
    London: a living laboratory for teaching and learning about resource constrained
    computing, computation and communication. Here, we outline a roadmap and propose
    high-level principles to aid this effort. We focus on how, when and where resources
    – energy, (raw) materials including water, space and time – are consumed by the
    building (place), its occupants (people) and their activities (pedagogy). We describe
    practical difficulties associated with identifying, acquiring and analysing relevant
    data. Beyond technical challenges, we find a need to rematerialise the information
    society: to reveal the full costs of Internet and Communication Technology and
    electrical and electronic equipment by, for example, undertaking life cycle analyses
    of end-user paraphernalia such as smartphones and demonstrating the corporeal
    nature of seemingly immaterial entities such as the “cloud.” We outline routes
    to realising three interlinked aims: cap the power consumed and greenhouse gas
    emitted per person per year, become a zero waste institution, and rejuvenate and
    (re)integrate the natural and built environments. We propose two maxims to aid
    policy making and guideline preparation: resource use needs to be minimised and
    minimal (reduced in relative as well as absolute terms), and responsible research
    and innovation encompasses decreasing the Department’s resource footprint and
    considering non-technological solutions to complex real-world problems. Keywords:
    resource footprint; energy; water; internet and communication technology; electrical
    and electronic equipment; e-waste; resource constrained computing, computation
    and communication; rematerialise the information society.'

    The right of access to information is a fundamental and universal right, necessary for economic empowerment and the fulfilment of other rights. However, as the recent Carter Center study on Liberia and Guatemala that is discussed in this article demonstrates, there are significant legal, cultural and structural barriers that continue to exist to inhibit women’s exercise of the right to information. Women are not able to exercise this right with the same frequency, ease and rate of success as men.

    This article examines the issue of gender inequity in the exercise of the right of access to information by exploring the legislative framework underpinning the right for women, detailing the value of information for women, describing the principal obstacles that propagate information asymmetries, and exploring potential responses to advance a more universal right to information.

  abstract: Recently, a second generation of advanced open government data (OGD) infrastructures
    has emerged, influenced by the principles of the Web 2.0 paradigm, and oriented
    towards the elimination of the clear distinction between providers and consumers
    of such data, and the support of data 'pro-sumers'. This paper presents and validates
    a methodology for evaluating these advanced second generation of ODG infrastructures,
    which is based on the estimation of value models of them from users' ratings.
    This value model includes assessments of the various types of value generated
    by such an infrastructure, and also of the relations among them as well. This
    enables a deeper understanding of the whole value generation mechanism and a rational
    definition of improvement priorities. The proposed methodology has been used for
    the evaluation of an advanced second generation ODG e-Infrastructure developed
    in the European project ENGAGE.

  abstract: Social media use has become increasingly popular among police forces.
    The literature suggests that social media use can increase perceived police legitimacy

    survey of Dutch citizens (N = 4,492), this article tests whether and how social
    media use aﬀects perceived legitimacy for a major social media platform, Twitter.
    A negligible number of citizens engage online with the police, and thus the ﬁ
    ndings reveal no positive relationship between participation and perceived legitimacy.
    The article shows that by enhancing transparency, Twitter does increase perceived
    police legitimacy, albeit to a limited extent. Subsequent analysis of the mechanism
    shows both an aﬀective and a cognitive path from social media use to legitimacy.
    Overall, the ﬁndings suggest that establishing a direct channel with citizens
    and using it to communicate successes does help the police strengthen their legitimacy,
    but only slightly and for a small group of interested citizens.

  abstract: A recent New York law requires medical providers to offer HIV tests as
    part of routine care. We developed a system dynamics simulation model of the HIV
    testing and care system to help administrators understand the law's potential
    epidemic impact, resource needs, strategies to improve implementation, and appropriate
    outcome indicators for future policy evaluations once postlaw data become available.
    Policy modeling allowed us to synthesize information from numerous sources including
    quantitative administrative data sets and practitioners' content expertise, structure
    the information to be viewed both numerically and visually, and organize consensus
    for decisionmaking purposes. This case illustrates how policy modeling can provide
    an integrated framework for administrators to examine policy problems in complex
    systems, particularly when data time lags limit pre--post comparisons and key
    outcomes cannot be measured directly.

  abstract: 'In the networked information and knowledge-based economy and society,
    the notions of ‘open’ and ‘openness’ are used in a variety of contexts; open source,
    open access, open economy, open government, open innovation – just to name a few.
    This paper aims at discussing openness and developing a taxonomy that may be used
    to analyse the concept of openness. Are there different qualities of openness?
    How are these qualities interrelated? What analytical tools may be used to understand
    openness? In this paper four qualities of openness recurrent in literature and
    debate are explored: accessibility, transparency, participation and sharing. To
    further analyse openness new institutional theory as interpreted by Williamson
    (2000) is used, encompassing four different institutional levels; cultural embeddedness,
    institutional environment, governance structure and resource allocations. At what
    institutional levels is openness supported and/or constrained? Accessibility as
    a quality of openness seems to have a particularly strong relation to the other
    qualities of openness, whereas the notions of sharing and collaborative economics
    seem to be the most complex and contested quality of openness in the knowledge-based
    economy. This research contributes to academia, policy and governance, as handling
    of challenges with regard to openness vs. closure in different contexts, territorial,
    institutional and/or organizational, demand not only a better understanding of
    the concept, but also tools for analysis.'

  abstract: In today's era of globalization, sustainable mobility is considered as
    a key factor in the economic growth of any country. With the emergence of open
    data initiatives, there is tremendous potential to improve mobility. This paper
    presents findings of a detailed analysis of moblity open data initiatives in nine
    smart cities - Amsterdam, Barcelona, Chicago, Dublin, Helsinki, London, Manchester,
    New York and San Francisco. The paper discusses the study of various sustainable
    indicators in the mobility domain and convergence with present open datasets.
    Specifically, it throws light on open data ecosystems in terms of their production
    and consumption. It gives a comprehensive view of the nature of mobility open
    data with respect to their formats, interactivity, and availability. The paper
    details the open datasets in terms of their alignment with different mobility
    indicators, publishing platforms, applications and API's available. The paper
    discusses how these open datasets have shown signs of fostering organic innovation
    and sustainable growth in smart cities with impact on mobility trends. The results
    of the work could be used to inform the design of data driven sustainabile mobility
    in smart cities to maximize the utilization of available open data resources.

  abstract: This article presents a case study of the open data project in the Chicago
    area. The main purpose of the research is to explore empowering potential of an
    open data phenomenon at the local level as a platform useful for promotion of
    civic engagement projects and provide a framework for future research and hypothesis
    testing. Today the main challenge in realization of any e-government projects
    is a traditional top–down administrative mechanism of their realization itself
    practically without any input from members of the civil society. In this respect,
    the author of the article argues that the open data concept realized at the local
    level may provide a real platform for promotion of proactive civic engagement.
    By harnessing collective wisdom of the local communities, their knowledge and
    visions of the local challenges, governments could react and meet citizens' needs
    in a more productive and cost-efficient manner. Open data-driven projects that
    focused on visualization of environmental issues, mapping of utility management,
    evaluating of political lobbying, social benefits, closing digital divide, etc.
    are only some examples of such perspectives. These projects are perhaps harbingers
    of a new political reality where interactions among citizens at the local level
    will play a more important role than communication between civil society and government
    due to the empowering potential of the open data concept.

  abstract: "Of its $4.1 trillion fiscal year 2016 budget, the U.S. federal government
    and its grantmaking agencies will give out billions of dollars in the form of
    grants to states, localities, and individuals, supporting a dizzying array of
    activities, from scientific research and economic development to arts, culture,
    and education. \n\nGrantmaking, in short, plays a vital role in helping our government,
    our researchers, and our communities confront 21st-century challenges. Despite
    grantmaking's importance, we have a decidedly 20th-century system in place for
    deciding how we make these billions of dollars of crucial public investments.
    To make the most of limited funding—and help build confidence in the ability of
    public investments to make a positive difference—it is essential for our government
    agencies to try more innovative approaches to designing, awarding, and measuring
    their grantmaking activities."

    This report highlights the ideas and practices that underlie the work of crowdsourcing intermediaries: actors who collect and analyse citizen feedback using digital platforms, and use it to support positive change. Most studies of crowdsourcing initiatives in the transparency and accountability field are primarily concerned with representation (whose voice is being heard?) and impact (what kind of change is being supported?). By contrast, this study shifts the spotlight onto crowdsourcing intermediaries themselves, their motives, and their theories of change and action.

    The research used an original conceptual framework that combines ideas from the governance and social accountability fields with networked gatekeeping theory. According to this framework, crowdsourcing intermediaries are gatekeepers of citizen voice who can shape and therefore control many different aspects of the flow of information generated by contributors.

  abstract: Crowdsourcing is beginning to be used for policymaking. The “wisdom of
    crowds” [Surowiecki 2005], and crowdsourcing [Brabham 2008], are seen as new avenues
    that can shape all kinds of policy, from transportation policy [Nash 2009] to
    urban planning [Seltzer and Mahmoudi 2013], to climate policy. In general, many
    have high expectations for positive outcomes with crowdsourcing, and based on
    both anecdotal and empirical evidence, some of these expectations seem justified
    [Majchrzak and Malhotra 2013]. Yet, to our knowledge, research has yet to emerge
    that unpacks the different forms of crowdsourcing in light of each stage of the
    well-established policy cycle. This work addresses this research gap, and in doing
    so brings increased nuance to the application of crowdsourcing techniques for
    policymaking.

    "When voting on a proposal one in fact chooses between two alternatives: (i) A new hypothetical social state depicted by the proposal and (ii) the status quo (henceforth: Reality); a Yes vote favors a transition to the proposed hypothetical state, while a No vote favors Reality. Social Choice theory generalizes voting on one proposal to ranking multiple proposals; that Reality was forsaken during this generalization is, in our view, inexplicable. Here we propose to rectify this neglect and incorporate Reality into Social Choice, distinguishing between Reality and hypothesis. We do so by recognizing Reality as an ever-present, always-relevant, evolving social state that is distinguished from hypothetical social states, and explore the ramifications of this recognition.

    Incorporating Reality into Social Choice offers: (i) A natural way to resolve the Condorcet paradox and Condorcet cycles, (ii) a resolution to the vexing ambiguity regarding what do approval voters, in fact, approve? (iii) a simple and practical show-of-hands agenda that implements an approval vote in one round and Condorcet-consistent voting in multiple rounds, (iv) democratic action plans, which are sequences of social states starting with Reality, in which the transition from one to the next has democratic support, and (v) reasoned nullification of Independence ofIrrelevant Alternatives and hence abdication of Arrow’s Theorem. Arrow’s theorem was taken to show that democracy, conceived as government by the will of the people, is an incoherent illusion. Incorporating Reality into Social Choice may clear this intellectual blemish on democracy; pave the way for the broad application of the Condorcet criterion; and, more generally, help restore trust in democracy by showing that it offers a coherent and hopeful vision."

  abstract: 'Nowadays, involving citizens in Local Environmental Governance (LEG)
    is becoming increasingly important. In order to empower the role of citizen in
    this context, we propose an approach that relies on the establishment of a physical
    and intellectual space for shared understanding and collaboration between all
    stakeholders impacted by an environmental problem (in our case odour emission).
    Based on the development of an Information Technology (IT) system allowing odour
    emission measurement as well as the collection of citizen feedback, a Living Lab
    (LL) approach is being implemented that involves citizens, public authorities,
    industry and environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs). According to
    the definition of the European commission, Living Labs are “open innovation environments
    in real-life settings, in which userdriven innovation is fully integrated within
    the co-creation process of new services, products and societal infrastructures”.
    Based on this definition and considering, in our case, citizens as one of the
    end-users of the IT system, we argue that such an approach will empower their
    role in local environmental governance. This article presents the method and techniques
    that will be used in order to set up such a Living Lab. More precisely, we focus
    here on the first step of this method: defining the components that will support
    the management of a Living Lab relying on an IT system. This step consists in
    the identification of the Living Lab stakeholders (citizen, industry, public authorities,
    NGOs, etc.), including their characteristics, fears, expectations, involvement
    and engagement regarding the Living Lab. To do this, 2 main approaches are being
    combined: A Living Lab approach that aims to involve citizens in local Environmental
    Governance (LEG) design. Use of Human-Centred Design (HCD), to combine IT developments
    and LL needs, for example Personas methodology and usability test. A Living Lab
    relies mainly on stakeholders’ involvement in order to build trust and establish
    a common goal. In this sense, sociologists’ approaches ((Akrich et al. 2006);)
    bring valuable information on how to mobilise different actors in order to innovate
    (Actor Network Theory). However, in the innovation process, these approaches are
    only considering human actors and do not take into account any technological aspects.
    However, if Living Labs are relying on human actors’ interactions it should also
    take into account their interactions with the IT system it is based on. In this
    case, HumanCentred Design (HCD) being an approach that aims to make IT systems
    usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, is to
    be considered as complementary to the sociologists approaches. This article, based
    on the work performed in the FP7 European project OMNISCIENTIS, presents the theoretical
    context in which this study takes place as well as the overall methodology.'

  abstract: The concept of Big Data has become very popular over the last decade,
    with large technology companies successfully building their business models around
    its exploitation. The public sector in the United Kingdom has tried to follow
    suit and local governments in particular have tried to introduce new models of
    service delivery based on the routine extraction of information from their own
    Big Data. These attempts have been hailed as the beginning of a new era for the
    public sector where service delivery and commissioning are shaped by data intelligence
    on local needs and by evidence on the outcomes. In this article we assess this
    claim and the extent to which it captures the way local governments in the United
    Kingdom use intelligence from Big Data in light of the structural barriers they
    face when trying to exploit their data. We also present a case study on the development
    and deployment of an integrated data model for children services in a large county
    council in the South-East of England.

  abstract: Smart Cities, a concept widely growing in popularity, describes cities
    that use digital technology, data analysis and connectivity to create value. The
    basic abstraction of a Smart City service includes collecting data about an urban
    issue, transmitting it to a central decision making process and “improving” the
    city with the insights generated. This model has spurred much critique, claiming
    Smart Cities are undemocratic, discriminatory and cannot significantly improve
    citizen's quality of life. But what if the citizens were active in the process?
    It was Jane Jacobs who said “Cities have the capability of providing something
    for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.” In
    this paper we lay a conceptual groundwork to envision “The Well-Informed City”
    - a decentralized, self-organizing Smart City service, where the value is created
    by everybody. The agents, who are the citizens of the city, are the ones who use
    the data to create value. We base the model on the cities' feature of Self-Organization
    as described in the domain of Complexity Theory of Cities. We demonstrate its
    theoretical possibility, describe a short case study and finish with suggestions
    for future empirical research. This work is highly significant due to the ubiquitous
    nature of contemporary mobile based information services and growing open data
    sets.

  abstract: Big and Open Linked Data (BOLD) results in new opportunities and have
    the potential to transform government and its interactions with the public. BOLD
    provides the opportunity to analyze the behavior of individuals, increase control,
    and reduce privacy. At the same time BOLD can be used to create an open and transparent
    government. Transparency and privacy are considered as important societal and
    democratic values that are needed to inform citizens and let them participate
    in democratic processes. Practices in these areas are changing with the rise of
    BOLD. Although intuitively appealing, the concepts of transparency and privacy
    have many interpretations and are difficult to conceptualize, which makes it often
    hard to implement them. Transparency and privacy should be conceptualized as complex,
    non-dichotomous constructs interrelated with other factors. Only by conceptualizing
    these values in this way, the nature and impact of BOLD on privacy and transparency
    can be understood, and their levels can be balanced with security, safety, openness
    and other socially-desirable values.

    have varying degrees of impact and at different governance system levels.

  abstract: Within the most recent discussion on smart cities and the way this vision
    is affecting urban changes and dynamics, this book explores the interplay between
    planning and design both at the level of the design and planning domains’ theories
    and practices.Urban transformation is widely recognized as a complex phenomenon,
    rich in uncertainty. It is the unpredictable consequence of complex interplay
    between urban forces (both top-down or bottom-up), urban resources (spatial, social,
    economic and infrastructural as well as political or cognitive) and transformation
    opportunities (endogenous or exogenous). The recent attention to Urban Living
    Lab and Smart City initiatives is disclosinga promising bridge between the micro
    scale environments, with the dynamics of such forces and resources, and the urban
    governance mechanisms. This bridge is represented by those urban collaborative
    environments, where processes of smart service co-design take place through dialogic
    interaction with and among citizens within a situated and cultural-specific frame.

  abstract: Participation in discussions about the public interest can be enhanced
    by technology, but can also create an environment in which participants are overwhelmed
    by the quantity, quality, and diversity of information and arguments. Political
    participation is at a greater disadvantage than non-political activities in that
    participants from different parties already start out with established differences,
    which requires them to reach some form of common ground before progress can be
    made. Those seeking authentic deliberation are discouraged to participate when
    confronted with uncivil and inflammatory rhetoric. These issues are often exacerbated
    in online discussions, where lack of identity cues and low barriers to entry can
    lead to heightened incivility between participants, often labeled as “flaming”
    and “trolling”. This paper explores the extent to which moderator systems, tools
    online discussion forums use to manage contributions, can reduce information overload
    and encourage civil conversations in virtual discussion spaces. Using the popular
    website Slashdot as an example of sound moderation in a public discourse setting,
    we found that users move toward consensus about which and how comments deserve
    to be moderated. Using these findings, we explore how transferable these systems
    are for participation in public matters specifically to the unique attributes
    of political discussion. Slashdot's political forum provides a comparison group
    that allowed us to find quantitative and qualitative differences in political
    posting, comments, and moderation. Our results show that large scale, civil participation
    is possible with a distributed moderation system that enables regularly lively
    debates to be conducted positively because the system provides tools for people
    to enforce norms of civility.

  abstract: |-
    Many technology innovation hubs are developing impactful, locally relevant civic tech solutions to pressing commercial and social issues. Given that most hubs’ ‘double bottom line’ approach to their communities and the impact they aspire to, they are faced with becoming political animals. Many of the challenges they tackle require negotiating or renegotiating power relationships, and co-creating public sector policy solutions.

    There is latent, but recognised, potential for tech innovation hubs in the global South to play a more overt role in promoting social change through contributing to the ‘thickening’ of local democratic space and policy co- creation. Unfortunately, in many cases, the mutual trust, understanding of incentives and shared buy-in that would facilitate this co-creation and collaboration between tech innovation hubs and public sector partners are lacking. Often, hubs avoid policy engagement altogether, or are constrained to doing so in ad hoc, superficial or premature ways. Five emerging types of engagement can be identified.

  abstract: Premised upon the observation that MOOC and crowdsourcing phenomena share
    several important characteristics, including IT mediation, large-scale human participation,
    and varying levels of openness to participants, this work systematizes a comparison
    of MOOC and crowdsourcing phenomena along these salient dimensions. In doing so,
    we learn that both domains share further common traits, including similarities
    in IT structures, knowledge generating capabilities, presence of intermediary
    service providers, and techniques designed to attract and maintain participant
    activity. Stemming directly from this analysis, we discuss new directions for
    future research in both fields and draw out actionable implications for practitioners
    and researchers in both domains.

  abstract: "Data-driven tools and techniques, particularly machine learning methods
    that underpin artificial intelligence, offer promise in improving healthcare systems
    and services. One of the companies aspiring to pioneer these advances is DeepMind
    Technologies Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Google conglomerate, Alphabet
    Inc. In 2016, DeepMind announced its first major health project: a collaboration
    with the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, to assist in the management of
    acute kidney injury. Initially received with great enthusiasm, the collaboration
    has suffered from a lack of clarity and openness, with issues of privacy and power
    emerging as potent challenges as the project has unfolded. Taking the DeepMind-Royal
    Free case study as its pivot, this article draws a number of lessons on the transfer
    of population-derived datasets to large private prospectors, identifying critical
    questions for policy-makers, industry and individuals as healthcare moves into
    an algorithmic age.\n\n"

  abstract: Today, governments release governmental data that were previously hidden
    to the public. This democratization of governmental open data (OD) aims to increase
    transparency but also fuels innovation. Indeed, the release of governmental OD
    is a global trend, which has evolved into governmental open innovation (GOI).
    In GOI, governmental actors purposively manage the knowledge flows that span organizational
    boundaries and reveal innovation-related knowledge to the public with the aim
    to spur innovation for a higher economic and social welfare at regional, national,
    or global scale. GOI subsumes different revealing strategies, namely governmental
    OD, problem, and solution revealing. This chapter introduces the concept of GOI
    that has evolved from global OD efforts. It present a historical analysis of the
    emergence of GOI in four different continents, namely, Europe (UK and Denmark),
    North America (United States and Mexico), Australia, and China to highlight the
    emergence of GOI at a global scale.

  abstract: New technologies pose new challenges on the protection of privacy and
    they stimulate new debates on the scope of privacy. Such debates usually concern
    the individuals’ right to control the flow of his or her personal information.
    The article however discusses new challenges posed by new technologies in terms
    of their impact on groups and their privacy. Two main challenges are being identified
    in this regard, both having to do with the formation of groups through the involvement
    of algorithms and the lack of civil awareness regarding the consequences of this
    involvement. On the one hand, there is the phenomenon of groups being created
    on the basis of big data without the members of such groups being aware of having
    been assigned and being treated as part of a certain group. Here, the challenge
    concerns the limits of personal law, manifesting with the disability of individuals
    to address possible violations of their right to privacy since they are not aware
    of them. On the other hand, commercially driven Websites influence the way in
    which groups form, grow and communicate when doing this online and they do this
    in such subtle way, that members oftentimes do not take into account this influence.
    This is why one could speak of a kind of domination here, which calls for legal
    regulation. The article presents different approaches addressing and dealing with
    those two challenges, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, a conclusion
    gathers the insights reached by the different approaches discussed and reflects
    on future challenges for further research on group privacy in times of big data.

  abstract: This paper presents the conceptual framework and justification for a “Quantified
    Community” (QC) and a networked experimental environment of neighborhood labs.
    The QC is a fully instrumented urban neighborhood that uses an integrated, expandable,
    and participatory sensor network to support the measurement, integration, and
    analysis of neighborhood conditions, social interactions and behavior, and sustainability
    metrics to support public decision-making. Through a diverse range of sensor and
    automation technologies -- combined with existing data generated through administrative
    records, surveys, social media, and mobile sensors -- information on human, physical,
    and environmental elements can be processed in real-time to better understand
    the interaction and effects of the built environment on human well-being and outcomes.
    The goal is to create an “informatics overlay” that can be incorporated into future
    urban development and planning that supports the benchmarking and evaluation of
    neighborhood conditions, provides a test-bed for measuring the impact of new technologies
    and policies, and responds to the changing needs and preferences of the local
    community.

  abstract: "This report is the second in a series of annual studies and explores
    the level of Open Data Maturity in\nthe EU28 and Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein
    – referred to as EU28+. The measurement is built\non two key indicators Open Data
    Readiness and Portal Maturity, thereby covering the level of\ndevelopment of national
    activities promoting Open Data as well as the level of development of national\nportals.\nIn
    2016, with a 28.6% increase compared to 2015, the EU28+ countries completed over
    55% of their\nOpen Data journey showing that, by 2016, a majority of the EU28+
    countries have successfully\ndeveloped a basic approach to address Open Data.
    The Portal Maturity level increased by 22.6\npercentage points from 41.7% to 64.3%
    thanks to the development of more advanced features on\ncountry data portals.
    The overall Open Data Maturity groups countries into different clusters:\nBeginners,
    Followers, Fast Trackers and Trend Setters.\nBarriers do remain to move Open Data
    forward. The report concludes on a series of recommendations,\nproviding countries
    with guidance to further improve Open Data maturity. Countries need to raise\nmore
    (political) awareness around Open Data, increase automated processes on their
    portals to\nincrease usability and re-usability of data, and organise more events
    and trainings to support both local\nand national initiatives. "

  abstract: "In conventional wisdom on crowdsourcing, the number of people define
    the crowd and maximizing this number is often assumed to be the goal of any crowdsourcing
    exercise. However, we propose that there are structural characteristics of the
    crowd that might be more important than the sheer number of participants. These
    characteristics include (1) growth rate and its attractiveness to the members,
    (2) the equality among members, (3) the density within provisional boundaries,
    (4) the goal orientation of the crowd, and (5) the \"seriality\" of the interactions
    between members of the crowd. We then propose a typology that may allow managers
    to position their companies’ initiatives among four strategic types: crowd crystals,
    online communities, closed crowd, and open crowd driven innovation. We show that
    incumbent companies may prefer a closed and controlled access to the crowd, limiting
    the potential for gaining results and insights from fully open crowd-driven innovation
    initiatives. Consequently, we argue that the effects on industries and organizations
    by open crowds are still to be explored, possibly via the mechanisms of entrepreneurs
    exploiting open crowds as new entrants, but also for the configuration of industries
    such as, e.g., finance, pharmaceuticals, or even the public sector where the value
    created usually comes from interpretation issues and exploratory problem solving.\n\n"

  abstract: This special issue of the Social Science Computer Review provides a sample
    of the latest strategies employing large data sets in social media and political
    communication research. The proliferation of information communication technologies,
    social media, and the Internet, alongside the ubiquity of high-performance computing
    and storage technologies, has ushered in the era of computational social science.
    However, in no way does the use of “big data” represent a standardized area of
    inquiry in any field. This article briefly summarizes pressing issues when employing
    big data for political communication research. Major challenges remain to ensure
    the validity and generalizability of findings. Strong theoretical arguments are
    still a central part of conducting meaningful research. In addition, ethical practices
    concerning how data are collected remain an area of open discussion. The article
    surveys studies that offer unique and creative ways to combine methods and introduce
    new tools while at the same time address some solutions to ethical questions.

  abstract: |-
    Benigno Aquino III ran for the position of President of the Philippines in 2010, with a campaign slogan of "Kung walang corrupt, walang mahirap" (when there is no corruption, there is no poverty). Following his win, his administration initiated reforms in government that focused on improving financial management, budget transparency, government procurement, and local government transparency. Key among these was in 2011 when the Philippines became one of the founding partners of the Open Government Partnership (OGP), which aimed to provide an international platform for domestic reformers committed to making their governments more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens.

    This case study explores the introduction and implementation of open data by the Government of the Philippines. It first presents the government's enabling motivations and how the programme was conceived, then looks into the introduction and implementation of open data in the Philippines using Anthony Giddens’ theory of structuration as the analytical lens. It focuses on the key policy, technology, data, and public engagement components of the Open Data Philippines (ODP) implementation, including significant milestones and critical issues.

  abstract: This article investigates the intersection of digital and social inequality
    in the context of disaster recovery. In doing so, the article responds to the
    optimism present in recent claims about “humanitarian technology” which refers
    to the empowering uses and applications of interactive technologies by disaster-affected
    people. Drawing on a long-term ethnography with affected communities recovering
    from Typhoon Haiyan that hit the Philippines in 2013 triggering a massive humanitarian
    response, the article offers a grounded assessment of the role of social media
    in disaster recovery. In particular, the article focuses on whether any positive
    consequences associated with digital media use are equally spread among better
    off and socially marginalized participants. The analysis reveals sharp digital
    inequalities which map onto existing social inequalities. While some of our already
    better-off participants have access to a rich media landscape which they are able
    to navigate often reaping significant benefits, low-income participants are trapped
    in a delayed recovery with diminished social media opportunities. The fact that
    some participants are using social media to recover at a rapid pace while others
    are languishing behind represents a deepening of social inequalities. In this
    sense, digital inequality can amplify social inequalities leading to a potential
    “second-order disaster.” This refers to humanly perpetuated disasters that can
    even surpass the effects of the natural disaster.

  abstract: The proliferation of big data makes it possible to better target city
    services like hygiene inspections, but city governments rarely have the in-house
    talent needed for developing prediction algorithms. Cities could hire consultants,
    but a cheaper alternative is to crowdsource competence by making data public and
    offering a reward for the best algorithm. A simple model suggests that open tournaments
    dominate consulting contracts when cities can tolerate risk and when there is
    enough labor with low opportunity costs. We also report on an inexpensive Boston-based
    restaurant tournament, which yielded algorithms that proved reasonably accurate
    when tested "out-of-sample" on hygiene inspections.

  abstract: 'Smart Cities appeared in literature in late ‘90s and various approaches
    have been developed so far. Until today, smart city does not describe a city with
    particular attributes but it is used to describe different cases in urban spaces:
    web portals that virtualize cities or city guides; knowledge bases that address
    local needs; agglomerations with Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
    infrastructure that attract business relocation; metropolitan-wide ICT infrastructures
    that deliver e-services to the citizens; ubiquitous environments; and recently
    ICT infrastructure for ecological use. Researchers, practicians, businessmen and
    policy makers consider smart city from different perspectives and most of them
    agree on a model that measures urban economy, mobility, environment, living, people
    and governance. On the other hand, ICT and construction industries stress to capitalize
    smart city and a new market seems to be generated in this domain. This chapter
    aims to perform a literature review, discover and classify the particular schools
    of thought, universities and research centres as well as companies that deal with
    smart city domain and discover alternative approaches, models, architecture and
    frameworks with this regard.'

  abstract: The overflow of information generated during disasters can be as paralyzing
    to humanitarian response as the lack of information. Making sense of this information--Big
    Data--is proving an impossible challenge for traditional humanitarian organizations,
    which is precisely why they're turning to Digital Humanitarians. This new humanitarians
    mobilize online to make sense of vast volumes of data--social media and text messages;
    satellite and aerial imagery--in direct support of relief efforts worldwide. How?
    They craft ingenious crowdsourcing solutions with trail-blazing insights from
    artificial intelligence. This book charts the spectacular rise of Digital Humanitarians,
    highlighting how their humanity coupled with innovative Big Data solutions is
    changing humanitarian relief for forever.

  abstract: "In our study we have identified five different areas that are relevant
    for service design: policy making, cultural and organizational change, training
    and capacity building, citizens engagement and digitization.\n \n Service design
    is taking a role in “policy creation”. Not only does it bring in-depth insights
    in the needs and constraints of citizens that help to design policies that really
    work for citizens - it also enables and facilitates processes of co-creation with
    different stakeholders. Policies are perceived as a piece of design work that
    is in a constant development and they are made by people for people."

  abstract: Citizen science has seen enormous growth in recent years, in part due
    to the influence of the Internet, and a corresponding growth in interest. However,
    the few stand-out examples that have received attention from media and researchers
    are not representative of the diversity of the field as a whole, and therefore
    may not be the best models for those seeking to study or start a citizen science
    project. In this work, we present the results of a survey of citizen science project
    leaders, identifying sub-groups of project types according to a variety of features
    related to project design and management, including funding sources, goals, participant
    activities, data quality processes, and social interaction. These combined features
    highlight the diversity of citizen science, providing an overview of the breadth
    of the phenomenon and laying a foundation for comparison between citizen science
    projects and to other online communities.

  abstract: |-
    This article reports a pioneering case study of a crowdsourced law-reform process in Finland. In the crowdsourcing
    experiment, the public was invited to contribute to the law-reform process by sharing their knowledge and ideas for
    a better policy. This article introduces a normative design framework of five principles for crowdsourced
    policymaking: inclusiveness, accountability, transparency, modularity, and synthesis. Inclusiveness, accountability,
    and transparency are overarching principles for crowdsourced policymaking. Modularity and synthesis support
    these overarching principles and are instrumental in achieving the main goals of crowdsourced policymaking,
    namely, an efficient search for knowledge and democratic deliberation among the participants. These principles
    apply to both the design of the process and the medium that the process takes place in, i.e., the technology
    facilitating crowdsourcing. This article analyzes the design of the crowdsourced off-road traffic law experiment in
    Finland using the five principles described above and provides a future research agenda for examining design
    aspects in crowdsourced policymaking.

    he 2016 US elections will be remembered for many things, but for those who work in politics, 2016 may be best remembered as the year that the use of data in politics reached its maturity. Through a collection of essays from leading experts in the field, this report explores how political data science helps to drive everything from overall strategy and messaging to individual voter contacts and advertising.
     Curated by Andrew Therriault, former Director of Data Science for the Democratic National Committee, this illuminating report includes first-hand accounts from Democrats, Republicans, and members of the media. Tech-savvy readers will get a comprehensive account of how data analysis has prevailed over political instinct and experience, along with examples of the challenges these practitioners face.

  abstract: All politics is local; “Big Data” now mean that policy analysis can increasingly
    be local. Modern empirical policy should be grounded in data provided by a network
    of city/university data centers. Public policy schools should partner with scholars
    in the emerging field of data science to train the next generation of policy researchers
    in the thoughtful use of the new types of data; the apparent secular decline in
    the applications to public policy schools is coincident with the emergence of
    data science as a field of study in its own right. The role of national statistical
    agencies should be fundamentally rethought—and reformulated to one of four necessary
    strands in the data infrastructure; that of providing benchmarks, confidentiality
    protections, and national statistics.

  abstract: The Map Seeking Circuit (MSC) has been suggested to address the inverse
    problem of transformation discovery as found in signal processing, vision, inverse
    kinematics and many other natural tasks. According to this idea, a parallel search
    in the transformation space of a high dimensional problem can be decomposed into
    parts efficiently using the ordering property of superpositions. Deterministic
    formulations of the circuit have been suggested. Here, we provide a probabilistic
    interpretation of the architecture whereby the superpositions of the circuit are
    seen as a series of marginalisations over parameters of the transform. Based on
    this, we interpret the weights of the MSC as importance weights. The latter suggests
    the incorporation of Monte-Carlo approaches in the MSC, providing improved resolution
    of parameter estimates within resource constrained implementations. As a final
    contribution, we model mixed serial/parallel search strategies of biological vision
    to reduce the problem of collusions, a common problem in the standard MSC approach.

  abstract: |
    This paper reviews evidence on the use of 23 information and communication technology (ICT) platforms
     to project citizen voice to improve public service delivery. This meta-analysis focuses on empirical studies
     of initiatives in the global South, highlighting both citizen uptake (‘yelp’) and the degree to which public
     service providers respond to expressions of citizen voice (‘teeth’). The conceptual framework further distinguishes
     between two trajectories for ICT-enabled citizen voice: Upwards accountability occurs when users
     provide feedback directly to decision-makers in real time, allowing policy-makers and program managers
     to identify and address service delivery problems – but at their discretion. Downwards accountability, in
     contrast, occurs either through real time user feedback or less immediate forms of collective civic action
     that publicly call on service providers to become more accountable and depends less exclusively on decision-
     makers’ discretion about whether or not to act on the information provided. This distinction between
     the ways in which ICT platforms mediate the relationship between citizens and service providers allows for
     a precise analytical focus on how different dimensions of such platforms contribute to public sector responsiveness.
     These cases suggest that while ICT platforms have been relevant in increasing policymakers’
     and senior managers’ capacity to respond, most of them have yet to influence their willingness to do so.

  abstract: "‘In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes, For they in thee a thousand
    errors note; But ‘tis my heart that loves what they despise …’ 1 This sonnet and
    the ancient Japanese notion of wabi-sabi view aesthetics or beauty as imperfect,
    impermanent and incomplete. Rather than celebrating the human diversity created
    by our ‘imperfections’, today's society increasingly focuses on them as ‘areas
    for improvement’, often via a doctor’s scalpel or the latest gadget. Developments
    in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (STEMM) promise
    a tomorrow where ‘errors’ or ‘deficiencies’ in an organism’s genetic and/or phenotypic
    makeup can be modulated, enhanced, corrected, redefined or eradicated by, for
    instance, networks of biological nanomachines. Upgraded organisms will be convolutions
    of organic parts, electronic components, microchips, and biomechanotronic devices.
    Humans 1.0, Humans 2.0 and transhumans will live in new fully immersive worlds
    (virtual reality), inhabit a modified real world (augmented reality), and exist
    with an altered body schema (mixed-reality). This future world could be a place
    of total technological convergence, where it may not be possible to ensure privacy
    of an individual’s thoughts. It could also be a place where people can be subjected
    to Social Engineering and manipulation, including the potential for viruses and
    malware infecting the brain or body, as well as new forms of external control
    of individuals by third parties. In this discussion paper, we will explore the
    potential privacy, security, and ethical issues raised by humanmachine mergers.
    The focus is on research, development and products at the intersection of robotics,
    artificial intelligence, Big Data, and smart computing. We suggest that there
    is a need for a more holistic approach to the assessment of technology and its
    governance. Additionally, we suggest that in order to determine how the law will
    need to respond to this particular future space, it is necessary to understand
    the full impacts of human-machine mergers on societies and our planet – to go
    beyond these three issues. Since STEMM-related activities are promising a cornucopia
    of future spaces, we will propose that the problems of governance and assessment
    require a new conception of ‘responsible research and innovation’, one that is
    fulfilled by our recently proposed FLE5 SH framework.2 To some extent the FLE5
    SH framework can be seen as allowing the formation of a social contract, whereby
    all stakeholders are required to engage in a review of this wider spectrum of
    the possible impacts of technologies. We suggest that a Precautionary Principle
    approach may be of assistance in considering the impacts of technologies, remembering
    that especially in the context of software based systems, it is always useful
    to think first and bugfix later."

  abstract: Information technology transfer is increasingly a crucial element of development
    and humanitarian aid initiatives. Social protection programmes are incorporating
    digitised Management Information Systems and electronic transfers, registration
    and electoral systems are deploying biometric technologies, the proliferation
    of mobile phones is facilitating access to increased amounts of data, and technologies
    are being transferred to support security and rule of law efforts. Many of these
    programmes and technologies involve the surveillance of individuals, groups, and
    entire populations. The collection and use of personal information in these development
    and aid initiatives is without precedent, and subject to few legal safeguards.
    In this report we show that as development and humanitarian donors and agencies
    rush to adopt new technologies that facilitate surveillance, they may be creating
    and supporting systems that pose serious threats to individuals’ human rights,
    particularly their right to privacy.

  abstract: 'This book highlights state-of-the-art research, development and implementation
    efforts concerning social media in government services, bringing together researchers
    and practitioners in a number of case studies. It elucidates a number of significant
    challenges associated with social media specific to government services, such
    as:  benefits and methods of assessing; usability and suitability of tools, technologies
    and platforms; governance policies and frameworks; opportunities for new services;
    integrating social media with organisational business processes; and specific
    case studies. The book also highlights the range of uses and applications of social
    media in the government domain, at both local and federal levels. As such, it
    offers a valuable resource for a broad readership including academic researchers,
    practitioners in the IT industry, developers, and government policy- and decision-makers.'

    In this article I want to suggest that the Icelandic constitution-writing processwas likely to have produced a good constitution—that is a constitution meetingobjective standards of quality for that country and the circumstances of itspeople—to the extent that it strived for inclusiveness.6On the basis of what isempirically known of the Icelandic constitutional process, I will further arguethat inclusiveness was aimed at, and at least partially achieved, through threedifferent and complementary methods: (i) direct popular participation at variousstages of the process, (ii) elements of descriptive representativeness where directparticipation wasn’t possible, and (iii) transparency. All three aspects arguablycombined to ensure not just procedural legitimacy, but also some degree ofepistemic reliability.

    The ﬁrst section of this article offers a brief review of the various sequencesof the constitution-writing process in Iceland. The second section examines the ﬁrst inclusive dimension of the process, namely its participatory aspects,from the organization of a National Forum—the results of which formed thebasis of the Constitutional Council’s deliberations—to the widely discussed“crowdsourcing” of some of the constitution-writing process. The third section turns to descriptive representation in the National Forum and in the Constitutional Council, as one institutional choice that made for indirectinclusiveness where direct participation wasn’t possible. The fourth sectionconsiders the transparency of the process. The ﬁfth section reviews the ways inwhich the process wasn’t as inclusive as it could have been, and examines thevarious design ﬂaws and weaknesses that should have, and to a degree did,challenge both the legitimacy and epistemic reliability of the process and itsresulting outcome. The conclusion derives some lessons for future experiments ofthe kind.

  abstract: 'Increasingly, there has been a focus on creating democratic standards
    and norms in order to best facilitate open exchange of information and communication
    online - a goal that fits neatly within the feminist aim to democratize content
    creation and community. Collaborative website, such as blogs, social networks
    and, as focused on in this article, Wikipedia, represent both a cyberspace community
    entirely outside the structures of the traditional (intellectual) proprietary
    paradigm and one that professes and truly embodies the philosophy of a completely
    open, free, and democratic resource for all. In theory, collaborative websites
    are the solution for which social activists, intellectual property opponents,
    and feminist theorists have been waiting. Unfortunately, we are now realizing
    that this utopian dream does not exist as anticipated: the Internet is neither
    neutral nor open to everyone. More importantly, these websites are not egalitarian;
    rather, they facilitate new ways to exclude and subordinate women. This article
    innovatively argues that the virtual world excludes women in two stages: first,
    by conrrolling websites and filtering out women; and second, by exposing women
    who survived the first stage as a hostile environment. Wikipedia, as well as other
    cyber-space environments, dmeonstrates the execution of the model, which results
    in the exclusion of women from the virtual sphere with all the implications thereof.'

  abstract: |-
    Crowdsourcing, itself a multidisciplinary field, can be well-served by incorporating theories and methods from affective computing. We present a various applications which are based on crowdsourcing. The direction of research on principles and methods can enable to solve a general problem via human computation systems. Crowdsourcing is nothing but an act of outsourcing tasks to a large group of people through an open request via the Internet. It has become popular among social scientists as a source to recruit research participants from the general public for studies. Crowdsourcing is introduced as the new online distributed problem solving model in which networked people collaborate to complete a task and produce the result. However, the idea of crowdsourcing is not new, and can be traced back to Charles Darwin. Darwin was interested in studying the universality of facial expressions in conveying emotions. For this, it required large amount of database and for this he had to consider a global population to get more general conclusions.

    This paper provides an introduction to crowdsourcing, guidelines for using crowdsourcing, and its applications in various fields. Finally, this article proposes conclusion which is based upon applications of crowdsourcing.

  abstract: The Open Data movement has mainly been a data provision movement. The
    release of Open Data is usually motivated by (i) government transparency (citizen
    access to government data), (ii) the development of services by third parties
    for the benefit for citizens and companies (typically smart city approach), or
    (iii) the development of new services that stimulate the economy. The success
    of the Open Data movement and its return on investment should therefore be assessed
    among other criteria by the number and impact of the services created based on
    those data. In this paper, we study the development of services based on open
    data and means to make the data opening process more effective.

  abstract: One essential characteristic of open data ecosystems is their development
    through feedback loops, discussions and dynamic data suppliers - user interactions.
    These user-centric features communicate the users’ needs to the open data community,
    as well to the public sector organizations responsible for data publication. Addressing
    these needs by the corresponding public sector organizations, or even by utilising
    the power of the community as ENGAGE supports, can significantly promote and accelerate
    innovation. However, such elements appear barely to be part of existing open data
    practices in the public sector. A survey we conducted has shown that professional
    open data users find the feedback and discussion on open data infrastructures
    from their users to their providers as highly useful and important, but they state
    that they do not know at least one open data infrastructure that provides various
    types of discussion, and feedback mechanisms. In this paper we describe and discuss
    an open data platform, which contributes to filling this gap and also present
    a usage scenario of it, explaining the sequence of using its functionality. The
    discussed open data infrastructure combines functionalities that aim to close
    the feedback loop and to return information to public authorities that can be
    useful for better government data opening and publication, as well as establishing
    communication channels between all stakeholders. This may effectively lead to
    the stimulation and facilitation of value generation from open data, as such functionality
    positions the user at the centre of the open data publication process.

  abstract: 'Various strands of literature on civic engagement, ''big data'' and open
    government view digital technologies as the key to easier government accountability
    and citizens'' empowerment, and the solution to many of the problems of contemporary
    democracies. Drawing on a critical analysis of contemporary Mexican social and
    political phenomena, and on a two-year-long ethnography with the #YoSoy132 networked
    movement, this article demonstrates that digital tools have been successfully
    deployed by Mexican parties and governments in order to manufacture consent, sabotage
    dissidence, threaten activists, and gather personal data without citizens'' agreement.
    These new algorithmic strategies, it is contended, clearly show that there is
    nothing inherently democratic in digital communication technologies, and that
    citizens and activists have to struggle against increasingly sophisticated techniques
    of control and repression that exploit the very mechanisms that many consider
    to be emancipatory technologies.'

  abstract: The agglomeration of rules and regulations over time has produced a body
    of legal code that no single individual can fully comprehend. This complexity
    produces inefficiencies, makes the processes of understanding and changing the
    law difficult, and frustrates the fundamental principle that the law should provide
    fair notice to the governed. In this article, we take a quantitative, unbiased,
    and software-engineering approach to analyze the evolution of the United States
    Code from 1926 to today. Software engineers frequently face the challenge of understanding
    and managing large, structured collections of instructions, directives, and conditional
    statements, and we adapt and apply their techniques to the U.S. Code over time.
    Our work produces insights into the structure of the U.S. Code as a whole, its
    strengths and vulnerabilities, and new ways of thinking about individual laws.
    For example, we identify the first appearance and spread of important terms in
    the U.S. Code like "whistleblower" and "privacy." We also analyze and visualize
    the network structure of certain substantial reforms, including the Patient Protection
    and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
    Protection Act, and show how the interconnections of references can increase complexity
    and create the potential for unintended consequences. Our work is a timely illustration
    of computational approaches to law as the legal profession embraces technology
    for scholarship, to increase efficiency, and to improve access to justice.

  abstract: 'We set out to test the limits of transparency around governmental development
    of big data analytics, focusing our investigation on local and state government
    use of predictive algorithms. It is here, in local government, that algorithmically-determined
    decisions can be most directly impactful. And it is here that stretched agencies
    are most likely to hand over the analytics to private vendors, which may make
    design and policy choices out of the sight of the client agencies, the public,
    or both. To see just how impenetrable the resulting "black box" algorithms are,
    we filed 42 open records requests in 23 states seeking essential information about
    six predictive algorithm programs. We selected that most widely-used and well-reviewed
    programs, including those developed by for-profit companies, nonprofits, and academic/
    private sector partnerships. The goal was to see if, using the open records process,
    we could discover what policy judgements these algorithms embody, and could evaluate
    their utility and fairness. To do this work, we identified what meaningful "algorithmic
    transparency" entails. We found that in almost every case, it wasn''t provided.
    Over-broad assertions of trade secrecy were a problem. But contrary to conventional
    wisdom, they were not the biggest obstacle. It will not usually be necessary to
    release the code used to execute predictive models in order to dramatically increase
    transparency. We conclude that publicly-deployed algorithms will be sufficiently
    transparent only if (1) governments generate appropriate records about their objectives
    for algorithmic processes and subsequent implementation and validation; (2) government
    contractors reveal to the public agency sufficient information about how they
    developed the algorithm; and (3) public agencies and courts treat trade secrecy
    claims as the limited exception to public disclosure that the law requires. Although
    it would require a multi-stakeholder process to develop best practices for record
    generation and disclosure, we present what we belive are eight principal types
    of information that such records should ideally contain. '

  abstract: Natural disasters affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide every
    year. Emergency response efforts depend upon the availability of timely information,
    such as information concerning the movements of affected populations. The analysis
    of aggregated and anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) captured from the mobile
    phone infrastructure provides new possibilities to characterize human behavior
    during critical events. In this work, we investigate the viability of using CDR
    data combined with other sources of information to characterize the floods that
    occurred in Tabasco, Mexico in 2009. An impact map has been reconstructed using
    Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within this frame, the underlying communication
    activity signals in the CDR data have been analyzed and compared against rainfall
    levels extracted from data of the NASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number
    of active phones connected to each cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns
    in the most affected locations during and after the floods that could be used
    as signatures of the floods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment
    and population information awareness. The representativeness of the analysis has
    been assessed using census data and civil protection records. While a more extensive
    validation is required, these early results suggest high potential in using cell
    tower activity information to improve early warning and emergency management mechanisms.

  abstract: While the design of smart city ICT systems of today is still largely focused
    on (and therefore limited to) passive sensing, the emergence of mobile crowd-sensing
    calls for more active citizen engagement in not only understanding but also shaping
    of our societies. The Urban Civics Internet of Things (IoT) middleware enables
    such involvement while effectively closing several feedback loops by including
    citizens in the decision-making process thus leading to smarter and healthier
    societies. We present our initial design and planned experimental evaluation of
    city-scale architecture components where data assimilation, actuation and citizen
    engagement are key enablers toward democratization of urban data, longer-term
    transparency, and accountability of urban development policies. All of these are
    building blocks of smart cities and societies.

  abstract: |-
    Accountability is a complex issue in South Africa. The country has high levels of inequality, and marginalised groups struggle to make themselves heard by those in power. Yet the issue is further complicated by an interacting set of factors, including the legacy of apartheid, gender and religious issues, and the lack of access to those in power.

    Through a six-year research project, the Sustainable Livelihoods Foundation (SLF) used a range of technology-enabled participatory processes to unpack this lack of government accountability.

    This report focuses on four case studies, which examined the lived realities of marginalised groups and the activists that campaign on their behalf:
    - activists against gender-based violence and for community safety
    - community care workers and health committee members working for public health
    - informal traders and the informal economy
    - traditional medicine, Rastafarian bossie doktors and indigenous rights.

  abstract: 'Our modern security systems have recently come under a lot of criticism:
    as too bureaucratic and unadaptable, too secretive and untrustworthy, and too
    obsessed with information technology rather than human needs. Yet listing failures
    is easy; security is never perfect. The question is why current approaches fail
    and whether there are viable alternatives. The root of their shortcomings is in
    the interaction of the very pillars of our security system in the contemporary
    context. While our enemies have adopted the technologies of the Information Age,
    changing how they organize and fight, these same technologies have only created
    more vulnerabilities for states. Governments have been generally unwilling to
    maximize their use of these technologies because it would require the wider release
    of information and the opening of organizational structures to include society
    in security making. Yet countering diffuse modern threats striking deep into our
    states and across our economies requires mobilizing the diffuse skills and variation
    of modern society. Open approaches for mobilizing participation and coproduction
    have the capabilities needed to improve contemporary security policy making, problem
    solving, and provision. Moreover, open participatory security can be effective
    not only for technical security, but also for restoring trust among the citizens
    and rebuilding the legitimacy of the state.'

  abstract: 'Open Development (OD) is a subset of ICT4D that studies the potential
    of IT- enabled openness to support social change among poor or marginalized populations.
    Early OD work examined the potential of IT-enabled openness to decentralize power
    and enable public engagement by disintermediating knowledge production and dissemination.
    However, in practice, intermediaries have emerged to facilitate open data and
    related knowledge production activities in development processes. We identify
    five models of intermediation in OD work: decentralized, arterial, ecosystem,
    bridging, and communities of practice and examine the implications of each for
    stewardship of open processes. We conclude that studying OD through these five
    forms of intermediation is a productive way of understanding whether and how different
    patterns of knowledge stewardship influence development outcomes. We also offer
    suggestions for future research that can improve our understanding of how to sustain
    openness, facilitate public engagement, and ensure that intermediation contributes
    to open development.'

  abstract: Open collaboration has evolved as a new form of innovation creation in
    the public sector. Government organizations are using online platforms to collaborative
    create or contribute to public sector innovations with the help of external and
    internal problem solvers. Most recently the U.S. federal government has encouraged
    agencies to collaboratively create and share open source code on the social coding
    platform GitHub and allow third parties to share their changes to the code. A
    community of government employees is using the social coding site GitHub to share
    open source code for software and website development, distribution of data sets
    and research results, or to seek input to draft policy documents. Quantitative
    data extracted from GitHub's application programming interface is used to analyze
    the collaboration ties between contributors to government repositories and their
    reuse of digital products developed on GitHub by other government entities in
    the U.S. federal government. In addition, qualitative interviews with government
    contributors in this social coding environment provide insights into new forms
    of co-development of open source digital products in the public sector.

  abstract: |-
    Patient-related medical information is becoming increasingly available on the Internet, spurred by government open data policies and private sector data sharing initiatives. Websites such as HealthData.gov, GenBank, and PatientsLikeMe allow members of the public to access a wealth of health information. As the medical information terrain quickly changes, the legal system must not lag behind. This Article provides a base on which to build a coherent data policy. It canvasses emergent data troves and wrestles with their legal and ethical ramifications.

    Publicly accessible medical data have the potential to yield numerous benefits, including scientific discoveries, cost savings, the development of patient support tools, healthcare quality improvement, greater government transparency, public education, and positive changes in healthcare policy. At the same time, the availability of electronic personal health information that can be mined by any Internet user raises concerns related to privacy, discrimination, erroneous research findings, and litigation. This Article analyzes the benefits and risks of health data sharing and proposes balanced legislative, regulatory, and policy modifications to guide data disclosure and use.

  abstract: "Over the last few years, the Government of British Columbia (Canada)
    has initiated a variety of practices and policies aimed at providing more legitimate
    and effective governance. Leveraging advances in technology, the Government of
    British Columbia (BC) has focused on changing the way it engages with its citizens
    with the goal of changing the way it seeks input and develops and implements policy.
    The efforts are part of a broader trend among a wide variety of democratic governments
    to re-imagine public service and governance. \n\nThe goal of this report is to:
    Outline and benchmark the current state of the BC Government’s efforts in improving
    transparency, citizen engagement and streamlined service delivery; Inspire BC
    officials how to build upon the existing foundation by pointing to worthwhile
    practices and policies drawn from case studies and reflections of current practitioners
    and thinkers in the field. \n\nFor this report, we identified two central themes
    to position BC’s efforts. For each theme, the report provides an account of what
    BC is currently doing - benchmarking it with other jurisdictions."

  abstract: Since the publication of the best seller Nudge (Thaler and Sunstein 2008),
    the growth in the relevance of ‘Behavioural Economics’ (BE) and ‘Nudging’ has
    been exponential, both in terms of the adoption of behavioural perspectives in
    policy making and of ongoing academic research. With some simplification three
    strands can be singled out. First, the widespread application and institutionalisation

  abstract: During recent years, the amount of data released on platforms by public
    administrations around the world have exploded. Open government data platforms
    are aimed at enhancing transparency and participation. Even though the promises
    of these platforms are high, their full potential has not yet been reached. Scholars
    have identified technical and quality barriers of open data usage. Although useful,
    these issues fail to acknowledge that the meaning of open data also depends on
    the context and people involved. In this study we analyze open data usage from
    a practice lens – as a social construction that emerges over time in interaction
    with governments and users in a specific context – to enhance our understanding
    of the role of context and agency in the development of open data platforms. This
    study is based on innovative action-based research in which civil servants’ and
    citizens’ initiatives collaborate to find solutions for public problems using
    an open data platform. It provides an insider perspective of Open Data Work. The
    findings show that an absence of a shared cognitive framework for understanding
    open data and a lack of high-quality datasets can prevent processes of collaborative
    learning. Our contextual approach stresses the need for open data practices that
    work on the basis of rich interactions with users rather than government-centric
    implementations.

    assess the impacts of participatory governance and emerging social technologies
    used in governance. This\nwork is not meant to be a comprehensive review of current
    approaches to evaluating new governance initiatives\nbut is intended to frame
    the issues involved, and suggest where work needs to be done to develop better
    assessments.\nWe are also providing an annotated and open bibliography for further
    reading, inviting others to expand\nupon it. "

  abstract: Over recent decades, research on the Internet and political participation
    has substantially developed, from speculative studies on possible impacts in social
    and economic life to detailed analyses of organizational usage. In the field of
    politics, focus is increasingly shifting from understanding organizational, or
    supply side, to the usage and dimension of citizen engagement. Citizens have various
    ways to engage in civic political life, with many new forms of engagement facilitated
    by digital technologies. The question is to what extent these forms of engagement
    have any impact on society and the way society is governed. More particularly,
    what forms of engagement have impact, what type of impact is evidenced, is that
    impact positive or negative, in what ways, and for whom? Phrasing the question
    in this way recognizes that citizen engagement can have a range of differing impacts,
    in multifaceted forms, and these impacts may not always be positive for broader
    society.

  abstract: The present study provides the first evidence that illiteracy can be reliably
    predicted from standard mobile phone logs. By deriving a broad set of mobile phone
    indicators reflecting users financial, social and mobility patterns we show how
    supervised machine learning can be used to predict individual illiteracy in an
    Asian developing country, externally validated against a large-scale survey. On
    average the model performs 10 times better than random guessing with a 70% accuracy.
    Further we show how individual illiteracy can be aggregated and mapped geographically
    at cell tower resolution. Geographical mapping of illiteracy is crucial to know
    where the illiterate people are, and where to put in resources. In underdeveloped
    countries such mappings are often based on out-dated household surveys with low
    spatial and temporal resolution. One in five people worldwide struggle with illiteracy,
    and it is estimated that illiteracy costs the global economy more than 1 trillion
    dollars each year. These results potentially enable costeffective, questionnaire-free
    investigation of illiteracy-related questions on an unprecedented scale

  abstract: 'Since the end of the 1970s, a wide range of psychological, economic and
    sociological labratory and field experiments proved human beings deviating from
    rational choices and standard neo-classical profit maximization axioms to fail
    to explain how humans actually behave. Behavioral economists proposed to nudge
    and wink citizens to make better choices for them with many different applications.
    While th emotivation behind nudging appears as a noble endeavor to foster people''s
    lives around the world in very many different applications, the nudging approach
    raises questions of social hierarchy and class division. The motivating force
    of the nudgital society may open a gate of exploration of the populace and - based
    on privacy infringements - stripping them involuntarily from their own decision
    power in the shadow of legally-permitted libertarian paternalism and under the
    cloack of the noble goal of welfare-improving global governance. Nudging enables
    nudgers to plunder the simple uneducated citizen, who is neither aware of the
    nudging strategies nor able to oversee the tactics used by the nudgers. The nudgers
    are thereby legally protected by democratically assigned positions they hold or
    by outsourcing strategies used, in which social media plays a crucial role. Social
    media forces are captured as unfolding a class dividing nudgital society, in which
    the provoder of social communicationt ools can reap surplus value from the information
    shared from social media users. The social media provider thereby becomes a capitalist-industrialist,
    who benefits from the information shared by social media users, or so-called consumer-workers,
    who share private information in their wish to interact with friends and communicate
    to public. The social media capitalist-industrialist reaps surplus value from
    the social media consumer-workers'' information sharing, which stems from nudging
    social media users. For one, social media space can be sold to marketers who can
    constantly penetrate the consumer-worker in a subliminal way with advertisements.
    But also nudging occurs as the big data compiled about the social media consumer-worker
    can be resold to marketers and technocrats to draw inferences about consumer choices,
    contemporary market trends or individual personality cues used for governance
    control, such as, for instance, border protection and tax compliance purposes.
    The law of motion of the nudging societies hold an unequal concentration of power
    of those who have access to compiled data and who abuse their position under the
    cloak of hidden persuasion and in the shadow of paternalism. In the nudgital society,
    information, education and differing social classes determine who the nudgers
    and who the nudged are. Humans end in different silos or bubbles that differ in
    who has power and control and who is deceived and being ruled. The owners of the
    means of governance are able to reap a surplus value in a hiddle persuasion, protected
    by the vacuum to curb litertarian paternalism, in the moral shadow of the unnoticeable
    guidance and under the cloak of the presumption that some know what is more rational
    than others. All these features lead to an unprecedented contemporary class struggle
    between the nudgers (those who nudge) and the nudged (those who are nudged), who
    are divided by the implicit means of governance in the digital scenery. In this
    light, governing our common welfare through deceptive means and outsourced governance
    on social media appears critical. In combination with the underlying assumption
    of the nudgers knowing better what is right, just and fair within society, the
    digital age and social media tools hold potential unprecedented ethical challenges. '

    decision makers and stakeholders. The first water open data repository was released
    in 2013. The transparency policy expands with the publication of many APIs and
    data services aimed at citizens and specialists. The wide scope of the water fields
    (hydrology, biology, chemistry, economics...) is concerned. This paper focuses
    on three major projects: Hub''eau (a bigdata repository), the WILD programming
    library with the French WFD-reporting desk (an online data validator in line with
    EC obligations), SEEE (an online ecological assessment tool). These three projects
    are open source, available online and embody the will of their leaders (the French
    Agency for Biodiversity and the INSIDE cluster) to let a wider public invest the
    field of environmental data and to stimulate relevant stakeholders participation.'

    context, a voluntary response process, and outputs and outcomes. We also discuss
    challenges of digital volunteer networks for crisis response. This article is
    expected to contribute to the development of related theories and hypotheses and
    practical strategies for managing digital volunteer networks.'

  abstract: For decades, information related to public finances was out of reach for
    most of the people. Gradually, public budgets and tenders are becoming openly
    available and global initiatives promote fiscal transparency and open product
    and price data. But, the poor quality of economic open data undermines their potential
    to answer interesting questions (e.g. efficiency of public funds and market processes).
    Linked Open Economy (LOE) has been developed as a top-level conceptualization
    that interlinks the publicly available economic open data by modelling the flows
    incorporated in public procurement together with the market process to address
    complex policy issues. LOE approach is extensively used to enrich open economic
    data ranging from budgets and spending to prices. Developers, professionals, public
    administrations and any other interested party use and customize LOE model to
    develop new systems, to enable information exchange between systems, to integrate
    data from heterogeneous sources and to publish open data related to economic activities.

  abstract: |-
    Metrics evoke a mixed reaction from the research community. A commitment to using data and evidence to inform decisions makes many of us sympathetic, even enthusiastic, about the prospect of granular, real-time analysis of our own activities. Yet we only have to look around us, at the blunt use of metrics to be reminded of the pitfalls. Metrics hold real power: they are constitutive of values, identities and livelihoods.

    How to exercise that power to positive ends is the focus of this book. Using extensive evidence-gathering, analysis and consultation, the authors take a thorough look at potential uses and limitations of research metrics and indicators. They explore the use of metrics across different disciplines, assess their potential contribution to the development of research excellence and impact and consider the changing ways in which universities are using quantitative indicators in their management systems. Finally, they consider the negative or unintended effects of metrics on various aspects of research culture.

    Including an updated introduction from James Wilsdon, the book proposes a framework for responsible metrics and makes a series of targeted recommendations to show how responsible metrics can be applied in research management, by funders, and in the next cycle of the Research Excellence Framework.

  abstract: The availability and accessibility of open data has the potential to increase
    transparency and accountability and, in turn, the potential to improve the governance
    of universities as public institutions. In addition, it is suggested that open
    data is likely to increase the quality, efficacy and efficiency of research and
    analysis of the national higher education system by providing a shared empirical
    base for critical interrogation and reinterpretation. The Centre for Higher Education
    Transformation (CHET) has developed an online, open data platform providing institutional-level
    data on South African higher education. However, other than anecdotal feedback,
    little is known about how the data is being used. Using CHET as a case study,
    this project studied the use of the CHET open data initiative by university planners
    as well as by higher education studies researchers. It did so by considering the
    supply of and demand for open data as well as the roles of intermediaries in the
    South African higher education governance ecosystem.

  abstract: 'Although a great many different crowdsourcing approaches are available
    to those seeking to accomplish individual or organizational tasks, little research
    attention has yet been given to characterizing how those approaches might be based
    on task characteristics. To that end, we conducted an extensive review of the
    crowdsourcing landscape, including a look at what types of taxonomies are currently
    available. Our review found that no taxonomy explored the multidimensional nature
    of task complexity. This paper develops a taxonomy whose specific intent is the
    classification of approaches in terms of the types of tasks for which they are
    best suited. To develop this task-based taxonomy, we followed an iterative approach
    that considered over 100 well-known examples of crowdsourcing. The taxonomy considers
    three dimensions of task complexity: (a) task structure – is the task well-defined,
    or does it require a more open-ended solution; (2) task interdependence – can
    the task be solved by an individual, or does it require a community of problem
    solvers; and (3) task commitment – what level of commitment is expected from crowd
    members? Based on this taxonomy, we identify seven categories of crowdsourcing
    and discuss prototypical examples of each approach. Furnished with such an understanding,
    one should be able to determine which crowdsourcing approach is most suitable
    for a particular task situation.'

  abstract: 'Over the past few decades, a new form of governance has emerged to replace
    adversarial and managerial modes of policy making and implementation. Collaborative
    governance, as it has come to be known, brings public and private stakeholders
    together in collective forums with public agencies to engage in consensus-oriented
    decision making. In this article, we conduct a meta-analytical study of the existing
    literature on collaborative governance with the goal of elaborating a contingency
    model of collaborative governance. After reviewing 137 cases of collaborative
    governance across a range of policy sectors, we identify critical variables that
    will influence whether or not this mode of governance will produce successful
    collaboration. These variables include the prior history of conflict or cooperation,
    the incentives for stakeholders to participate, power and resources imbalances,
    leadership, and institutional design. We also identify a series of factors that
    are crucial within the collaborative process itself. These factors include face-to-face
    dialogue, trust building, and the development of commitment and shared understanding.
    We found that a virtuous cycle of collaboration tends to develop when collaborative
    forums focus on “small wins” that deepen trust, commitment, and shared understanding.
    The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of our contingency
    model for practitioners and for future research on collaborative governance.

  abstract: "With points of departure in philosophy, logic, social psychology, economics,
    and choice and game theory, Infostorms shows how information may be used to improve
    the quality of personal decision and group thinking but also warns against the
    informational pitfalls which modern information technology may amplify: From science
    to reality culture and what it really is, that makes you buy a book like this.\n
    \n The information society is upon us. New technologies have given us back pocket
    libraries, online discussion forums, blogs, crowdbased opinion aggregators, social
    media and breaking news wherever, whenever. But are we more enlightened and rational
    because of it? \n \n Infostorms provides the nuts and bolts of how irrational
    group behaviour may get amplified by social media and information technology.
    If we could be collectively dense before, now we can do it at light speed and
    with potentially global reach. That’s how things go viral, that is how cyberbullying,
    rude comments online, opinion bubbles, status bubbles, political polarisation
    and a host of other everyday unpleasantries start. Infostorms will give the story
    of the mechanics of these phenomena. This will help you to avoid them if you want
    or learn to start them if you must. It will allow you to stay sane in an insane
    world of information."

    to weigh freedom and security, finding the golden mean between unlimited license

  abstract: The thesis focuses on the emergence of e-democracy in the UK between 1999
    and 2013. It examines the part that policy actors have played in shaping the agenda.
    Emphasis is placed on how e-democracy is understood by those charged with developing
    initiatives and implementing government policy on e-democracy. Previous research
    on e-democracy has focused largely on the impact of Web technologies on political
    systems and/or on how, why and to what degree, citizens participate. Less attention
    is paid to what happens inside government, in how policy actors’ conceive public
    engagement in the policy process. Their perceptions and shared understandings
    are crucial to the commissioning, implementation, or deflection of participatory
    opportunities. This thesis is concerned with exploring how policy actors experience,
    interpret and negotiate e-democracy policy and practices and their perceptions
    of citizen involvement in the policy process. Competing discourses shape institutional
    expectations of e-democracy in the UK. The research examines how policy actors
    draw upon wider discourses such as the modernisation of government and the emphasis
    on transparency. It analyses understandings of technologies in government and
    the effects of relational interactions and linkages in policy and practice.

  abstract: Psychologists have repeatedly shown that a single statistical factor—often
    called “general intelligence”—emerges from the correlations among people’s performance
    on a wide variety of cognitive tasks. But no one has systematically examined whether
    a similar kind of “collective intelligence” exists for groups of people. In two
    studies with 699 people, working in groups of two to five, we find converging
    evidence of a general collective intelligence factor that explains a group’s performance
    on a wide variety of tasks. This “c factor” is not strongly correlated with the
    average or maximum individual intelligence of group members but is correlated
    with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution
    of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the group.

  abstract: Big Data analytics plays a key role through reducing the data size and
    complexity in Big Data applications. Visualization is an important approach to
    helping Big Data get a complete view of data and discover data values. Big Data
    analytics and visualization should be integrated seamlessly so that they work
    best in Big Data applications. Conventional data visualization methods as well
    as the extension of some conventional methods to Big Data applications are introduced
    in this paper. The challenges of Big Data visualization are discussed. New methods,
    applications, and technology progress of Big Data visualization are presented.

  abstract: |-
    Governance Networks in the Public Sector presents a comprehensive study of governance networks and the management of complexities in network settings. Public, private and non-profit organizations are increasingly faced with complex, wicked problems when making decisions, developing policies or delivering services in the public sector. These activities take place in networks of interdependent actors guided by diverging and sometimes conflicting perceptions and strategies. As a result these networks are dominated by cognitive, strategic and institutional complexities. Dealing with these complexities requires sophisticated forms of coordination: network governance.

    This book presents the most recent theoretical and empirical insights into governance networks. It provides a conceptual framework and analytical tools to study the complexities involved in handling wicked problems in governance networks in the public sector. The book also discusses strategies and management recommendations for governments, business and third sector organisations operating in and governing networks.

  abstract: Potential consumers are increasingly profiled to detect their habits and
    preferences in order to provide for targeted services. Both industry and the European
    Commission are investing huge sums of money into what they call Ambient Intelligence
    and the creation of an ‘Internet of Things’. Such intelligent networked environments
    will depend on real time monitoring and profiling, resulting in real time adaptations
    of the environment. In this contribution Mireille Hildebrandt will assess the
    threats and opportunities of such autonomic profiling in terms of its impact on
    individual autonomy and refined discrimination and indicate the extent to which
    traditional data protection is ineffective as regards profiling. She will then
    highlight the potential of the draft General Data Protection Regulation to provide
    a more adequate and effective level playing field for both the industry and individual
    citizens in the profiling era. The most revolutionary change she detects is not
    the right to be forgotten or the right to data portability but the right to be
    informed about the potential consequences of being profiled.

  abstract: Democractic countries produce higher levels of innovation than autocratic
    ones, but does democratization itself lead to innovation growth either in the
    short or the long run? The existing literature has extensively examined the relationship
    between democracy and growth but seldom explored the effect of democracy on innovation,
    which might be an important channel through which democracy contributes to economic
    growth. This article aims to fill this gap and continue to the long-standing debate
    on the relationship between democracy and innovation by offering empirical evidence
    based on a data set covering 156 countries between 1964 and 2010. This results
    from the differences-in-differences method show that democracy itself has no direct
    positive effect on innovation measured with patent counts, patent citations and
    patent originality.

  abstract: Currently, patient satisfaction from NHS services is estimated with measures
    that may hardly relate to selfreported needs of patients or that use old data.
    Nonetheless, healthcare institutions depend on funding that is decided in part
    with the help of the ill-calculated patient satisfaction. As a result, patients’
    actual best interest may be in conflict with the best interest of the evaluated
    NHS health organisations. Patients may receive suboptimal health services and
    lose trust in professionalism and intentions of doctors and health organisations
    that try to stick to performance targets. The reputation of medical professions
    may also drop and prompt health professionals to seek work elsewhere. Development
    of new organisational performance measurement tools from text data, the motive
    behind this study, can break the vicious cycle of distrust and improve the quality
    of healthcare by more accurately measuring patient satisfaction. The study involves
    processing of free-text online reviews of NHS GP services in England with deep
    learning to obtain a numeric representation of text data. Once text is transformed
    into numbers, two-ways fixed-effects regressions were carried out to see if there
    is a statistically significant correlation between how patients write about individual
    GP practices and their numeric evaluations of the GP services. Initial findings
    indicate that written reviews can be used as a predictor of patient satisfaction,
    and may be used to obtain real-time insights about whether and why patients are
    happy and/or unhappy about their GP service experience.

  abstract: |-
    The Public Impact Gap is the difference
    between the outcomes a government
    is achieving and the outcomes it could
    be achieving. It works by comparing a
    government’s performance on a given
    outcome (for example, road traffic safety) to a
    stretching but achievable benchmark based on
    a group of peers.
    A country’s Public Impact Gap tells us how far
    that country lags behind its peers, and also
    what impact could be achieved if the Gap were
    to be closed (for example, the number of lives
    that could saved). While it is a relatively simple
    concept, we believe that the Public Impact Gap
    can be a useful tool in holding governments
    to account for delivering outcomes in areas
    of fundamental importance to each of us,
    including education, health, and safety.
    Highlighting where Public Impact Gaps
    exist is just the beginning of the story. The
    Centre for Public Impact has also set out the
    means to diagnose, address and close Public
    Impact Gaps by publishing the Public Impact
    Fundamentals – a free tool for governments,
    developed with leading academics to help
    leaders achieve better outcomes. This tool can
    be used in conjunction with the Public Impact
    Observatory, a free database of more than 200
    case studies, accessible via the Centre for
    Public Impact’s website.

  abstract: The smart city has been envisioned as a place where citizens can participate
    in city decision making and in the design of city services. As a key part of this
    vision, pervasive digital technology and open data legislation are being framed
    as vehicles for citizens to access rich data about their city. It has become apparent
    though, that simply providing access to these resources does not automatically
    lead to the development of data-driven applications. If we are going to engage
    more of the citizenry in smart city design and raise productivity, we are going
    to need to make the data itself more accessible, engaging and intelligible for
    non-experts. This ongoing study is exploring one method for doing so. As part
    of the MK:Smart City project team, we are developing a tangible data look-up interface
    that acts as an alternative to the conventional DataBase. This interface, or DataPlace
    as we are calling it, takes the form of a map, which the user places sensors on
    to physically capture real-time data. This is a simulation of the physical act
    of capturing data in the real world. We discuss the design of the DataPlace prototype
    under development and the planned user trials to test out our hypothesis; that
    a DataPlace can make handling data more accessible, intelligible and engaging
    for non-experts than conventional interface types.

  abstract: |-
    Data collaboratives present a new form of cross-sector
    and public-private partnership to leverage (often
    corporate) data for addressing a societal challenge.
    They can be seen as the latest attempt to make data
    accessible to solve public problems. Although an
    increasing number of initiatives can be found, there is
    hardly any analysis of these emerging practices. This
    paper seeks to develop a taxonomy of forms of data
    collaboratives. The taxonomy consists of six dimensions
    related to data sharing and eight dimensions related to
    data use. Our analysis shows that data collaboratives
    exist in a variety of models. The taxonomy can help
    organizations to find a suitable form when shaping their
    efforts to create public value from corporate and other
    data. The use of data is not only dependent on the
    organizational arrangement, but also on aspects like the
    type of policy problem, incentives for use, and the
    expected outcome of data collaborative.

    political and community buy-in; mobilising citizens to become involved in civic
    actions; shifting mindsets and perceptions related to corruption and integrity;
    bringing diverse stakeholders together to share in a common vision of transformation.
    This report details the findings from an impact assessment of the the work of
    Accountability Lab Liberia conducted between August 2016 – March 2017, as part
    of a research and learning grant received through Making All Voices Count (MAVC).

    are influencing public awareness of accountability issues - such as corruption,
    transparency and open government - and are shifting citizen perceptions and catalysing
    grassroots movements to advocate for positive reforms as a result. A number of
    key strategic recommendations emerged from the survey and interviews conducted
    as part of this evaluation.'

  abstract: 'Many governments, international agencies and civil society organizations
    (CSOs) support and promote open data. Most open government data initiatives have
    focused on supply - creating portals and publishing information. But much less
    attention has been given to demand - understanding data needs and nurturing engagement.
    This research examines the demand for open data in South Africa, and asks under
    what conditions meeting this demand might influence accountability. Recognizing
    that not all open data projects are developed for accountability reasons, it also
    examines barriers to using government data for accountability processes. The research
    team identified and tested ‘use stories’ and ‘use cases’. How did a range of civil
    society groups with an established interest in holding local government accountable
    use - or feel that they could use - data in their work? The report identifies
    and highlights ten broad types of open data use, which they divided into two streams:
    ‘strategy and planning’ - in which CSOs used government data internally to guide
    their own actions; and ‘monitoring, mobilizing and advocacy’ - in which CSOs undertake
    outward-facing activities.'

  abstract: This paper presents the research of using Linked Data for enhancing accessibility
    data, especially for accessible travelling. With the aim of addressing the gap
    between users' special needs and accessibility data, this research initially explores
    the current situation of open accessibility data. Open accessibility data is the
    data related to the accessibility issues and associated with geographical data,
    which could benefit people with disabilities or special needs. This paper proposed
    a survey of open accessibility data in UK based on the datasets retrieved from
    five different resources. After examining the features of each dataset, a mapping
    approach using Semantic Web technologies is proposed to interlink these datasets
    together to generate a linked open accessibility repository and link this repository
    to other resources on the Linked Open Data Cloud (LODC). As a result, this research
    would not only benefit people with disabilities, but also contribute to a novel
    method to address accessibility information barriers by establishing a linked
    open accessibility data repository for publishing, integrating and consuming the
    accessibility data.

  abstract: 'This article introduces the special issue on statactivism, a particular
    form of action within the repertoire used by contemporary social movements: the
    mobilization of statistics. Traditionally, statistics has been used by the worker
    movement within the class conflicts. But in the current configuration of state
    restructuring, new accumulation regimes, and changes in work organization in capitalists
    societies, the activist use of statistics is moving. This first article seeks
    to show the use of statistics and quantification in contentious performances connected
    with state restructuring, main transformations of the varieties of capitalisms,
    and changes in work organization regimes. The double role of statistics in representing
    as well as criticizing reality is considered. After showing how important statistical
    tools are in producing a shared reading of reality, we will discuss the two main
    dimensions of statactivism – disclosure and affirmation. In other words, we will
    see the role of stat-activists in denouncing a certain state of reality, and then
    the efforts to use statistics in creating equivalency among disparate conditions
    and in cementing emerging social categories. Finally, we present the main contributions
    of the various research papers in this special issue regarding the use of statistics
    as a form of action within a larger repertoire of contentious action. Six empirical
    papers focus on statactivism against the penal machinery in the early 1970s (Grégory
    Salle), on the mobilisation on the price index in Guadalupe in 2009 (Boris Samuel),
    and in Argentina in 2007 (Celia Lury and Ana Gross), on the mobilisations of experts
    to consolidate a link between working conditions and health issues (Marion Gilles),
    on the production of activity data for disability policy in France (Pierre-Yves
    Baudot), and on the use of statistics in social mobilizations for gender equality
    (Eugenia De Rosa). Alain Desrosières wrote the last paper, coping with mobilizations
    proposing innovations in the way of measuring inflation, unemployment, poverty,
    GDP, and climate change. This special issue is dedicated to him, in order to honor
    his everlasting intellectual legacy.'

  abstract: 'Crowdsourcing systems promise to leverage the "wisdom of crowds" to help
    solve many kinds of problems that are difficult to solve using only computers.
    Although a crowd of people inherently represents a diversity of skill levels,
    knowledge, and opinions, crowdsourcing system designers typically view this diversity
    as noise and effectively cancel it out by aggregating responses. However, we believe
    that by embracing crowd workers'' diverse expertise levels, system designers can
    better leverage that knowledge to increase the wisdom of crowds. In this thesis,
    we propose solutions to a limitation of current crowdsourcing approaches: not
    accounting for a range of expertise levels in the crowd. The current body of work
    in crowdsourcing does not systematically examine this, suggesting that researchers
    may not believe the benefits of using mixed expertise warrants the complexities
    of supporting it. This thesis presents two systems, Escalier and Kurator, to show
    that leveraging mixed expertise is a worthwhile endeavor because it materially
    benefits system performance, at scale, for various types of problems. We also
    demonstrate an effective technique, called expertise layering, to incorporate
    mixed expertise into crowdsourcing systems. Finally, we show that leveraging mixed
    expertise enables researchers to use crowdsourcing to address new types of problems.'

  abstract: This paper tackles many of the important issues and discussions taking
    place in Europe and globally about the future of the public sector and how it
    can use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to respond innovatively
    and effectively to some of the acute societal challenges arising from the financial
    crisis as well as other deeper rooted global problems. These include inequality,
    poverty, corruption and migration, as well as climate change, loss of habitat
    and the ageing society. A conceptual framework for open governance systems enabled
    by ICT is proposed, drawing on evidence and examples from around the world as
    well as a critical appraisal of both academic and grey literature. The framework
    constructs a system of open assets, open services and open engagement, and this
    is used to move the e-government debate forward from a preoccupation with lean
    and small governments which ‘do more with less’ to examine the potential for open
    governance systems to also ‘do more with more’. This is achieved by enabling an
    open government and open public sector, as part of this open governance system,
    to ‘do more by leveraging more’ of the existing assets and resources across the
    whole of society, and not just within the public sector, many of which are unrealised
    and untapped, so in effect are ‘wasted’. The paper argues that efficiencies and
    productivity improvements are essential at all levels and across all actors, as
    is maximising both public and private value, but that they must also be seen at
    the societal level where trade-offs and interactions are required, and not only
    at the individual actor level.

  abstract: "The Institute of Development Studies (IDS), in partnership with World
    Vision Indonesia, are exploring whether a recently implemented nutrition surveillance
    intervention, known as M-health, is being used to improve community-based data
    collection on nutrition.\n \n The M-health mobile phone application has been integrated
    into the Indonesian national nutrition service delivery through the community-based
    health service called ‘posyandu’. Established in 1986, the posyandu is Indonesia’s
    main national community nutrition programme. It functions at the village level,
    enabling communities to access primary health care. The aim of the intervention
    is to reduce maternal, infant and child (under five) mortality rates. The posyandu
    involves five priority programmes: maternal and child health, which includes the
    ‘weighing post’ (growth monitoring); family planning; immunisation; nutrition,
    which includes nutrition counselling; and diarrhoea prevention and treatment.\n
    \n The programme works by the mobile phone application (M-health) automatically
    sending a referral to health workers at the sub-district-level in cases where
    a child does not meet the required growth targets. The application also provides
    the health community-based cadres with reminders and steps to accurately plan
    follow-up visits. These data are then sent to the community health centres at
    the sub-district-level, known in Indonesia as the puskesmas.\n \n In the period
    2013–15, researchers at IDS worked with World Vision Indonesia to assess whether
    data produced through mobile phone technology might trigger faster response by
    nutrition stakeholders. This short report supports ongoing work and focuses on
    how posyandu-level data might be used by different stakeholders."

  abstract: The budget is the key means for effecting policy in democracies, yet its
    preparation is typically an excluding, opaque process. We aim to rectify this
    by providing for the democratic creation of complete budgets, e.g., budgets of
    cooperatives, cities, or states. These budgets are typically (i) prepared, discussed,
    and voted upon by comparing with the present budget; (ii) quantitative, in that
    most items typically appear in quantities larger than 1 and with varying costs;
    and (iii) hierarchical, reflecting the hierarchical structure of the budgeted
    organization. These characteristics are not addressed by extant work on participatory
    budgeting, which usually produce budgets of new discrete projects not related
    to the present budget and are neither quantitative nor hierarchical. We apply
    the Condorcet principle to a general democratic budgeting scenario. While in the
    general case a vote may be any partial order on the items at stake, including
    quantitative ones, eliciting such a vote may be complex; to ease elicitation,
    votes may be provided as a simple amendment to the present budget, e.g., by adding
    or removing items or by changing their quantities. We devise a polynomial-time
    budgeting algorithm that, given such a scenario, produces the Condorcet winner
    if it exists and resolves Condorcet cycles by utilizing the distance from the
    present budget, in line with Reality-aware Social Choice theory. Our method can
    be applied hierarchically to democratically produce budgets of hierarchical organizations
    such as cities and states. While our democratic budgeting algorithm could be applied
    by the constituency at large, it could be just as useful to democratizing the
    budgeting process of budget committees and parliaments, supplanting the usual
    last-minute take-it-or-leave-it budget voting sessions by a process based on open
    discussion followed by a truly budget-shaping democratic vote.

  abstract: This chapter provides design lessons on how to take advantage of advances
    in information technologies that have enabled new governance infrastructures to
    become both possible and desirable. A governance infrastructure is the collection
    of technologies, people, policies, practices, resources, social norms, and information
    that interact to support governing activities. Smart governance infrastructures
    augment society's ability to organize, interact, and govern. Novel instances of
    smart governance infrastructures already exist and are regularly emerging in distributed
    organizations and online communities. As we think about rebooting the public square,
    this chapter is intended to challenge us to move beyond questions of how to best
    manage government institutions to questions of how to design governance systems
    with the appropriate incentives and rules to harness and coordinate the diversity,
    enthusiasm, and capabilities of those governed. We provide several design lessons
    learned from successful governance infrastructures and propose how they can be
    applied to address national priorities. This chapter anticipates how the interaction
    of technology and society can be leveraged to mindfully design problem-defined,
    participation-based governance infrastructures to return power to the people while
    increasing accountability and efficiency.

  abstract: Governments are one of the largest producers and collectors of data in
    many different domains and one major aim of open government data initiatives is
    the release of social and commercial value. Hence, we here explore existing processes
    of value creation on government data. We identify the dimensions that impact,
    or are impacted by value creation, and distinguish between the different value
    creating roles and participating stakeholders. We propose the use of Linked Data
    as an approach to enhance the value creation process, and provide a Value Creation
    Assessment Framework to analyse the resulting impact. We also implement the assessment
    framework to evaluate two government data portals.

    Open data can: i) more effectively target aid money and improve development programmes, ii) track development progress and prevent corruption, and iii) contribute to innovation, job creation and economic growth.

    To achieve these aims, the development community must address many challenges, including: a weak enabling environment for open data publishing; poor data quality; a mismatch between the demand for open data and the supply of appropriate datasets; a ‘digital divide’ between rich and poor, affecting both the supply and use of data; and a general lack of quantifiable data and metrics.

    With these challenges in mind, the report sets out ways that governments, donors and (international) NGOs – with the support of researchers, civil society and industry – can apply open data to help make the SDGs a reality:

    1. Reach global consensus around principles and standards, namely being ‘open by default’, using the Open Government Partnership’s Open Data Working Group as a global forum for discussion.
    2. Embed open data into funding agreements, ensuring that relevant, high-quality data is collected to report against the SDGs. Funders should mandate that data relating to performance of services, and data produced as a result of funded activity, be released as open data.
    3. Build a global partnership for sustainable open data, so that groups across the public and private sectors can work together to build sustainable supply and demand for data in the developing world.

  abstract: This article presents an analysis of participation patterns in an Alternate
    Reality Game, World Without Oil. This game aims to bring people together in an
    online environment to reflect on how an oil crisis might affect their lives and
    communities as a way to both counter such a crisis and to build collective intelligence
    about responding to it. We present a series of participation profiles based on
    a quantitative analysis of 1554 contributions to the game narrative made by 322
    players. We further qualitatively analyze a sample of these contributions. We
    outline the dominant themes, the majority of which engage the global oil crisis
    for its effects on commute options and present micro-sustainability solutions
    in response. We further draw on the quantitative and qualitative analysis of this
    space to discuss how the design of the game, specifically its framing of the problem,
    feedback mechanism, and absence of subject-matter expertise, counter its aim of
    generating collective intelligence, making it conducive to groupthink.

    Much of the literature on citizen accountability focuses on citizen voices. This research briefing is one of four which turn the spotlight on the how the state behaves in instances of accountable governance. Each examines a landmark social justice policy process in Africa, asking when and how the state listened, and to which actors; and why, at times, it chose not to listen.

    Citizen involvement in decision-making has been a significant part of Tanzania’s political reforms in recent years. For example, the local government reforms of the late 1990s emphasised the decentralisation of decision-making and policy formulation, especially on issues that affect people’s daily lives. Yet this research, which focused on primary education policies and programmes, revealed that the government seldom listens to stakeholders.

  abstract: "There is a certain allure to the idea that cities allow a person to both
    feel at home and like a stranger in the same place. That one can know the streets
    and shops, avenues and alleys, while also going days without being recognized.
    But as elites fill cities with “smart” technologies — turning them into platforms
    for the “Internet of Things” (IoT): sensors and computation embedded within physical
    objects that then connect, communicate, and/or transmit information with or between
    each other through the Internet — there is little escape from a seamless web of
    surveillance and power. This paper will outline a social theory of the “smart
    city” by developing our Deleuzian concept of the “spectrum of control.” We present
    two illustrative examples: biometric surveillance as a form of monitoring, and
    automated policing as a particularly brutal and exacting form of manipulation.
    We conclude by offering normative guidelines for governance of the pervasive surveillance
    and control mechanisms that constitute an emerging critical infrastructure of
    the “smart city.”\n\n"

  abstract: Public participation is not a recent phenomenon. It has spanned centuries,
    cultures and civilizations. The aim of this paper is to present a historical overview
    of public participation in some selected civilizations across the globe. The conceptual
    basis of the paper is premised on participatory democracy. It will adopt an analytical
    and historical approach. Scholars have recognized that public participation remains
    a relevant concept globally. The concept is not unproblematic, but there is enormous
    potential for substantive democratization of the public sphere. Hence, one of
    the key recommendations of the paper is that the potentials of public participation
    have to be fully explored and exploited.

  abstract: |-
    With cities growing rapidly throughout much of the developing world, the global development community increasingly recognizes the need to build the capacities of local leaders to analyze and apply data to improve urban policymaking and service delivery. Civil society leaders, development advocates, and local governments are calling for an “urban data revolution” to accompany the new UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a revolution that would provide city leaders new tools and resources for data-driven governance. The need for improved data and analytic capacity in rapidly growing cities is clear, as is the exponential increase in the volume and types of data available for policymaking. However, the institutional arrangements that will allow city leaders to use data effectively remain incompletely theorized and poorly articulated.

    This paper begins to fill that gap with a political economy framework that introduces three new concepts: permission, incentive, and institutionalization. We argue that without addressing the permission constraints and competing incentives that local government officials face in using data, investments in improved data collection at the local level will fail to achieve smarter urban policies. Granting permission and aligning incentives are also necessary to institutionalize data-driven governance at the local level and create a culture of evidence-based decisionmaking that outlives individual political administrations. Lastly, we suggest how the SDGs could support a truly transformative urban data revolution in which city leaders are empowered and incentivized to use data to drive decisionmaking for sustainable development.

    Development projects don’t always work as planned. This has long been acknowledged by those in the sector, and has led to several approaches that seek to solve complex development problems through enabling and encouraging greater adaptiveness and learning within projects (e.g. Doing Development Differently and Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation).

    Digital development projects experience many of these issues. Using technology for transparency and accountability (Tech4T&A) projects in Kenya as case studies, this research analysed the many different theoretical approaches to learning and adaptation, and then tested how these play out in reality.

    How can today’s growing cities use technology and design to improve their infrastructure, management, and quality of life? In this O’Reilly report, Paul McConnell and Mike Clare from Intersection review how connected services and platforms are redefining how cities function, and how people interact within them.

    As the world becomes more urbanized and connected, design methods can be applied to some of the most critical challenges among three major groups: citizens, civic stakeholders, and commercial interests.

    This report will provide you with background, examples, and approaches for citizen-centered experiences and civic innovation projects. The authors provide examples from projects including the MTA Subway System and LinkNYC—an ambitious program to replace New York’s aging pay phone infrastructure with the world’s largest and fastest free municipal Wi-Fi network.

  abstract: "In the years following 2008, developing countries as a whole may invest
    as much as US$100 billion annually in information infrastructure (Khalil & Kenny,
    2008). In addition, the rapid expansion of mobile phones – even in the poorer
    regions of the world – and the emergence of the \"social\" (i.e., participatory
    and collaborative) Web are rapidly reshaping not only the ways people access and
    share information, but also how they relate, collaborate, and organize (Benkler,
    2006; Shirky, 2008). These new technologies, most notably information and communication
    technologies (ICTs), offer new and transformative applications and services, means
    to communite and produce content, and decentralized innovation models (Heeks,
    2008). In this context of expanding ICT networks and applications, Khalil and
    Kenny (2008) appropriate ask, \"How can we catalyze the impact of ICTs on development?\"\n\nThe
    hypothesis of this paper is that open social arrangements, enabled by ICTs, can
    help to catalyze the development impacts of ICTs. In other words, open ICT ecosystems
    provide the space for the amplification and tranformation of social activities
    that can be powerful drivers of development. Note that an ICT ecosystem is understood
    to be more than just a technological system; rather, it is a social system within
    which ICTs are embedded. "

  abstract: This study adds to the body of research on open government by empirically
    measuring the association of government transparency and innovation. The study
    uses Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) as a proxy
    measure of government transparency. It assumes that an increase in government
    transparency increases applied innovation activity, which is measured as the number
    of annual patents by country residents. The study also tests whether the association
    is different for countries participating in the Open Government Partnership (OGP),
    a voluntary multi-stakeholder international collaboration of 63 countries who
    have committed to make their governments more transparent. The analysis uses fixed
    effects regression on panel data from 1996 to 2011 for 95 countries, including
    54 OGP members. Although the empirical results do not support the hypothesis that
    transparency and innovation are positively correlated for countries participating
    in the OGP, this finding contributes to the literature on open government by making
    an initial attempt to quantify the association of transparency and innovation.
    Additional future research demonstrating a positive relationship between transparency
    and innovation could help to justify implementation of open government policies
    and participation in the Open Government Partnership.

  abstract: Rising and changing citizen expectations, dire fiscal constraints, unfulfilled
    political aspirations, high professional ambitions, and a growing number of stubborn
    societal problems have generated an increasing demand for innovation of public
    policies and services. Drawing on the latest research, this book examines how
    current systems of public governance can be transformed in order to enhance public
    innovation. It scrutinizes the need for new roles and public sector reforms, and
    analyzes how the gradual transition towards New Public Governance can stimulate
    the exploration and exploitation of new and bold ideas in the public sector. It
    argues that the key to public innovation lies in combining and balancing elements
    from Classic Public Administration, New Public Management and New Public Governance,
    and theorizes how it can be enhanced by multi-actor collaboration for the benefit
    of public officials, private stakeholders, citizens, and society at large.

  abstract: Tearfund, a Christian faith-based international non-governmental organization,
    has for 15 years supported local churches to mobilize communities through a process
    called Church and Community Mobilization (CCM). The CCM advocacy pilot project
    in Uganda led to improvements in service delivery. In this paper, Tearfund and
    Making All Voices Count staff discuss recent research that examines the role of
    local churches, CCM and CCM advocacy in fostering transparency, citizen empowerment,
    inclusion and government responsiveness. The key themes they examine are social
    capital and the distinctive nature of faith-based mobilization, strategic advocacy
    and shifting the power dynamics between local-level government officials and citizens;
    and scaling up local-level accountability successes to the national level.

    This issue of the Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics highlights the ethical issues that arise when
    researchers conducting projects in low- and middle-income countries seek to share the data they produce. Although
    sharing data is considered a best practice, the barriers to doing so are considerable and there is a need for guidance and
    examples. To that end, the authors of this article reviewed the articles in this special issue to identify challenges common
    to the five countries and to offer some practical advice to assist researchers in navigating this “uncharted territory,” as
    some termed it. Concerns around informed consent, data management, data dissemination, and validation of research
    contributions were cited frequently as particularly challenging areas, so the authors focused on these four topics with the
    goal of providing specific resources to consult as well as examples of successful projects attempting to solve many of the
    problems raised.

  abstract: |-
    Open development is based on the premise that openly networked structures create the potential for people to collaborate in the production, organization and sharing of information in ways that can produce social, political and economic change. As a field of action and research, it emerges out of the work of people who, during the late 1990s and early 2000s, were actively exploring the relationship between digital network technologies and social change. IDRC has been an active participant in this space, and has contributed heavily to shaping the agenda around open development.

    This work emerges out of a lengthy history of IDRC research on information and communications technologies for development (Elder et al., 2013). As is well known, the information and communication technologies (ICTs) that IDRC has researched in developing country contexts for over 20 years have created massive upheaval in knowledge production, governance and business practices around the world (Benkler 2006). With this in mind, in the early 2000s, IDRC began to take up the work of people like Laurence Lessig (2007) and the free and open source software (FOSS) movement, and to collaborate with institutions like the Open Society Foundation and Shuttleworth Foundation, to do research on the role of copyright in harnessing and/or regulating the impacts of ICTs on social change processes.

    Background: Wikis may give clinician communities the opportunity to build knowledge relevant to their practice. The only previous study reviewing a set of health-related wikis, without specification of purpose or audience, globally showed a poor reliability.
    Objective: Our aim was to review medical wiki websites dedicated to clinical practices.
    Methods: We used Google in ten languages, PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, and Web of Science to identify websites. The review included wiki sites, accessible and operating, having a topic relevant for clinical medicine, targeting physicians or medical students. Wikis were described according to their purposes, platform, management, information framework, contributions, content, and activity. Purposes were classified as “encyclopedic” or “non-encyclopedic”. The information framework quality was assessed based on the Health On the Net (HONcode) principles for collaborative websites, with additional criteria related to users’ transparency and editorial policy. From a sample of five articles per wikis, we assessed the readability using the Flesch test and compared articles according to the wikis’ main purpose. Annual editorial activities were estimated using the Google engine.
    Results: Among 25 wikis included, 11 aimed at building an encyclopedia, five a textbook, three lessons, two oncology protocols, one a single article, and three at reporting clinical cases. Sixteen wikis were specialized with specific themes or disciplines. Fifteen wikis were using MediaWiki software as-is, three were hosted by online wiki farms, and seven were purpose-built. Except for one MediaWiki-based site, only purpose-built platforms managed detailed user disclosures. The owners were ten organizations, six individuals, four private companies, two universities, two scientific societies, and one unknown. Among 21 open communities, 10 required users’ credentials to give editing rights. The median information framework quality score was 6 out of 16 (range 0-15). Beyond this score, only one wiki had standardized peer-reviews. Physicians contributed to 22 wikis, medical learners to nine, and lay persons to four. Among 116 sampled articles, those from encyclopedic wikis had more videos, pictures, and external resources, whereas others had more posology details and better readability. The median creation year was 2007 (1997-2011), the median number of content pages was 620.5 (3-98,039), the median of revisions per article was 17.7 (3.6-180.5) and 0.015 of talk pages per article (0-0.42). Five wikis were particularly active, whereas six were declining. Two wikis have been discontinued after the completion of the study.
    Conclusions: The 25 medical wikis we studied present various limitations in their format, management, and collaborative features. Professional medical wikis may be improved by using clinical cases, developing more detailed transparency and editorial policies, and involving postgraduate and continuing medical education learners.

  abstract: |-
    A new generation of strategies for government accountability is needed, one that fully considers entrenched, institutional obstacles to change. Vertical integration of coordinated civil society policy monitoring and advocacy is one such strategy. Engaging each stage and level of public sector actions in an integrated way can locate the causes of accountability failures, show their interconnected nature, and leverage the local, national and transnational power shifts necessary to produce sustainable institutional change.

    This case study summary is one of seven that reflect on civil society monitoring and advocacy initiatives in the Philippines – all of which aim to improve government accountability in different sectors – through the lens of vertical integration.

    The study looks into the advocacy campaign of the Disaster Risk Reduction Network Philippines (DRRNetPhils), which was directed at the passage, implementation and review of the 2010 Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) Act. It examines the interaction of various initiatives and actions at different levels of policy-making, from the local to the national, introducing experiences and lessons from the campaign. It shows how using the vertical integration approach could be useful in framing and analysing similar monitoring and advocacy campaigns.

  abstract: This article investigates some issues associated with Big Data and analytics
    (Big Data) and ethics, examining how Big Data ethics are different than computer
    ethics and other more general ethical frameworks. In so doing, the author briefly
    investigates some of the previous research in "computer ethics," reviews some
    codes of ethics, analyzes the application of two frameworks on ethics to Big Data,
    and provides a definition of Big Data ethics. Ultimately, the author argues that
    in order to get sufficient specificity, a code of ethics for Big Data is necessary.

  abstract: 'This article looks at the promise of technology to revolutionise humanitarian
    action, especially in terms of the gathering and use of data. With many heralding
    a ‘data revolution’, the opportunities and enthusiasm for using social media and
    SMS data in crisis response are on the rise. The article constructs an analytical
    framework in order to scrutinise the three main claims made on behalf of technologically
    advanced humanitarian information systems: that they can access data more accurately,
    more quickly, and alter power relations in emancipatory ways. It does so in relation
    to two aspects of digital humanitarianism: visual technology and crisis mapping,
    and big data. The article is partly informed by a historical perspective, but
    also by interview and other material that suggests some of the claims made on
    behalf of technology are exaggerated. In particular, we argue that the enthusiasm
    for the data is vastly outstripped by the capacity to meaningfully analyse it.
    We conclude by scoping the implications of the future technological evolution
    of humanitarianism, in particular by examining how technology contributes to what
    Duffield terms ‘post-modern humanitarianism’.'

  abstract: |-
    Software has become essential to the functioning of cities. It is deeply embedded into the systems and infrastructure of the built environment and is entrenched in the management and governance of urban societies. Software-enabled technologies and services enhance the ways in which we understand and plan cities. It even has an effect on how we manage urban services and utilities.

    Code and the City explores the extent and depth of the ways in which software mediates how people work, consume, communication, travel and play. The reach of these systems is set to become even more pervasive through efforts to create smart cities: cities that employ ICTs to underpin and drive their economy and governance. Yet, despite the roll-out of software-enabled systems across all aspects of city life, the relationship between code and the city has barely been explored from a critical social science perspective. This collection of essays seeks to fill that gap, and offers an interdisciplinary examination of the relationship between software and contemporary urbanism.

  abstract: 'Cybernetics, or self-governance of animal and machine, requires the ability
    to sense the world and to act on it in an appropriate manner. Likewise, self-governance
    of a human society requires groups of people to collectively sense and act on
    their environment. I argue that the evolution of political systems is characterized
    by a series of innovations that attempt to solve (among others) two ‘scalability’
    problems: scaling up a group’s ability to make sense of an increasingly complex
    world, and to cooperate in increasingly larger groups. I then explore some recent
    efforts toward using the Internet and social media to provide alternative means
    for addressing these scalability challenges, under the banners of crowdsourcing
    and computer-supported argumentation. I present some lessons from those efforts
    about the limits of technology, and the research directions more likely to bear
    fruit.'

  abstract: "With around 3,200 tigers (Panthera tigris) left in the wild, the governments
    of 13 tiger range countries recently declared that there is a need for innovation
    to aid tiger research and conservation. In response to this call, we created the
    “Think for Tigers” study to explore whether crowdsourcing has the potential to
    innovate the way researchers and practitioners monitor tigers in the wild. The
    study demonstrated that the benefits of crowdsourcing are not restricted only
    to harnessing the time, labor, and funds from the public but can also be used
    as a tool to harness creative thinking that can contribute to development of new
    research tools and approaches. Based on our experience, we make practical recommendations
    for designing a crowdsourcing initiative as a tool for generating ideas.\n\n"

  abstract: 'While their meaning for targeted killings in counter-terrorism operations
    has been emphasized, drones assume an important role in the rise of Big Data.
    By long-term surveillance, drones gather imagery on possible suspects, war zones
    and border regions. This data can be used by intelligence agencies in order to
    optimize operations, such as targeted killings. As during long-term surveillance,
    a great amount of data is gathered, drones add another dimension to the Big Data-nexus.
    This paper will investigate which debates revolve about the role that drones assume
    in the use of Big Data in intelligence by explaining shifts in the intelligence
    cycle that have been caused through Big Data.   '

  abstract: This is an exploratory research designed to contribute to increase knowl-
    edge about open data in Brazil. The research is divided into two stages, namely,
    a quantitative and a qualitative stage. The quantitative research was designed
    to measure the scope of rules imposed by new Brazilian legislation for budget
    transparency in open data format. To this end, 27 websites of capitals6, one site
    of the federal government and one site of the Senate were analyzed. In addi- tion,
    a ranking of these 29 national and subnational entities was developed. The qualitative
    research was designed to complement the data collected during the quantitative
    survey with the aim of capturing possible impacts of open data on expanding human
    rights in Brazil based on the perception of more qualified users on open data
    access and analysis, the so-called "intermediaries."

  abstract: Privacy policies are supposed to provide transparency about a service's
    data practices and help consumers make informed choices about which services to
    entrust with their personal information. In practice, those privacy policies are
    typically long and complex documents that are largely ignored by consumers. Even
    for regulators and data protection authorities privacy policies are difficult
    to assess at scale. Crowdsourcing offers the potential to scale the analysis of
    privacy policies with microtasks, for instance by assessing how specific data
    practices are addressed in privacy policies or extracting information about data
    practices of interest, which can then facilitate further analysis or be provided
    to users in more effective notice formats. Crowdsourcing the analysis of complex
    privacy policy documents to non-expert crowdworkers poses particular challenges.
    We discuss best practices, lessons learned and research challenges for crowdsourcing
    privacy policy analysis.

  abstract: 'In this paper a framework is constructed to hypothesize if and how smart
    city technologies and urban big data produce privacy concerns among the people
    in these cities (as inhabitants, workers, visitors, and otherwise). The framework
    is built on the basis of two recurring dimensions in research about people''s
    concerns about privacy: one dimensions represents that people perceive particular
    data as more personal and sensitive than others, the other dimension represents
    that people''s privacy concerns differ according to the purpose for which data
    is collected, with the contrast between service and surveillance purposes most
    paramount. These two dimensions produce a 2 × 2 framework that hypothesizes which
    technologies and data-applications in smart cities are likely to raise people''s
    privacy concerns, distinguishing between raising hardly any concern (impersonal
    data, service purpose), to raising controversy (personal data, surveillance purpose).
    Specific examples from the city of Rotterdam are used to further explore and illustrate
    the academic and practical usefulness of the framework. It is argued that the
    general hypothesis of the framework offers clear directions for further empirical
    research and theory building about privacy concerns in smart cities, and that
    it provides a sensitizing instrument for local governments to identify the absence,
    presence, or emergence of privacy concerns among their citizens.'

  abstract: "Informed consent law’s emphasis on the disclosure of purely medical information
    – such as diagnosis, prognosis, and the risks and benefits of various treatment
    alternatives – does not accurately reflect modern understandings of how patients
    make medical decisions. Existing common law disclosure duties fail to capture
    a variety of non-medical factors relevant to patients, including information about
    the physician’s personal characteristics; the cost of treatment; the social implications
    of various health care interventions; and the legal consequences associated with
    diagnosis and treatment. Although there is a wealth of literature analyzing the
    merits of such disclosures in a few narrow contexts, there is little broader discussion
    and no consensus about whether there the doctrine of informed consent should be
    expanded to include information that may be relevant to patients but falls outside
    the traditional scope of medical materiality. This article seeks to fill that
    gap. \n\nI offer a normative argument for expanding the scope of informed consent
    disclosure to include non-medical information that is within the physician’s knowledge
    and expertise, where the information would be material to the reasonable patient
    and its disclosure does not violate public policy. This proposal would result
    in a set of disclosure requirements quite different from the ones set by modern
    common law and legislation. In many ways, the range of required disclosures may
    become broader, particularly with respect to physician-specific information about
    qualifications, health status, and financial conflicts of interests. However,
    some disclosures that are currently required by statute (or have been proposed
    by commentators) would fall outside the scope of informed consent – most notably,
    information about support resources available in the abortion context; about the
    social, ethical, and legal implications of treatment; and about health care costs."

  abstract: |-
    Waste is material information. Landfills are detailed records of everyday consumption and behavior; much of what we know about the distant past we know from discarded objects unearthed by archaeologists and interpreted by historians. And yet the systems and infrastructures that process our waste often remain opaque. In this book, Dietmar Offenhuber examines waste from the perspective of information, considering emerging practices and technologies for making waste systems legible and how the resulting datasets and visualizations shape infrastructure governance. He does so by looking at three waste tracking and participatory sensing projeects in Seattle, São Paulo, and Boston.

    Offenhuber expands the notion of urban legibility - the idea that the city can be read like a text - to introduce the concept of infrastructure legibility. He argues that infrastructure governance is enacted through representations of the infrastructural system, and that these representations stem from the different stakeholders' interests, which drive their effort to make the system legible. The Trash Track project in Seattle used sensor technology to map discarded items through the waste and recycling systems; the Forager project looked at the informal organization processes of waste pickers working for Brazilian recycling cooperatives; and mobile systems designed by the city of Boston allowed residents to report such infrastructure failures as potholes and garbage spills. Through these case studies, Offenhuber outlines an emerging paradigm of infrastructure governance based on a complex notion among users, technology, and the city.

  abstract: In this paper, we examine the challenges that regulators face in our rapidly
    changing world—from keeping up with technical and business model innovations and
    the growth in the number of suppliers of goods and services, to dealing with the
    increasingly digital nature of their constituents and the changing attitudes and
    behaviors of industries and consumers. We then identify opportunities for leaders
    of regulatory agencies to navigate today’s challenging landscape and prepare for
    the future—both in the way they make rules and the way they enforce them. In many
    ways, regulators can harness the very trends that have caused disruption and use
    them as a means to modernize regulatory practices and increase effectiveness.

  abstract: 'Deliberative democracy is at risk of becoming collateral damage of the
    current crisis of representative democracy. If deliberative democracy is necessarily
    representative and if representation betrays the true meaning of democracy as
    rule of, by, and for the people, then how can deliberative democracy retain any
    validity as a theory of political legitimacy? Any tight connection between deliberative
    democracy and representative democracy thus risks making deliberative democracy
    obsolete: a dated paradigm fit for a pre-crisis order, but maladjusted to the
    world of Occupy, the Pirate Party, the Zapatistas, and other anti-representative
    movements. This essay argues that the problem comes from a particular and historically
    situated understanding of representative democracy as ruled by elected elites.
    I argue that in order to retain its normative appeal and political relevance,
    deliberative democracy should dissociate itself from representative democracy
    thus understood and reinvent itself as the core of a more truly democratic paradigm,
    which I call “open democracy.” In open democracy, popular rule means the mediated
    but real exercise of power by ordinary citizens. This new paradigm privileges
    nonelectoral forms of representation and in it, power is meant to remain constantly
    inclusive of and accessible - in other words open - to ordinary citizens. '

  abstract: How does a movement for social justice, whose members are mainly drawn
    from the lower economic strata of society, build and sustain its power in the
    face of co-option, and social and geographical division? Members of the Bunge
    La Mwananchi movement in Kenya explored this question using action research. The
    movement carves spaces for debate and activism in the urban public sphere accessible
    to the unrepresented masses. The authorities leave these spaces mostly unmolested,
    in part because co-option by politicians and civil society organisations is as
    effective at wrong-footing the movement as mass arrests and riot police would
    be. The research reminded the members that the movement's power has always lain
    in its efforts to reach across internal divisions of ethnicity, gender, class
    and geography. As the research connected the debaters in one site with those in
    another, it demonstrated how communicative enquiry works to create solidarity
    within this most grass-roots of movements.

  abstract: Middle America is often described as if it’s on the margins of culture
    and innovation - “flyover country” - provincial, unsophisticated and stuck in
    the past. But Middle America is diverse and although it is not stuck in the past
    - rhetoric about it is. In this cultural forecast report, we spotlight the region,
    looking at it no through the lens of politics, ideology or outdated cliches, but
    rather through innovation. Key cities from Cleveland to Nashville to Louisville
    are reinventing themselves by embracing innovation in manufacturing, city design,
    healthcare, sustainability efforts and clean energy, and creatively solving problems
    that the entire country will eventually have to confront. And they’re imbuing
    this reinvention with characteristics Middle American values of community, collaboration,
    and concern for the social impact of their actions.

  abstract: Human computation, a term introduced by Luis von Ahn, refers to distributed
    systems that combine the strengths of humans and computers to accomplish tasks
    that neither can do alone. The seminal example is reCAPTCHA, a Web widget used
    by 100 million people a day when they transcribe distorted text into a box to
    prove they are human. This free cognitive labor provides users with access to
    Web content and keeps websites safe from spam attacks, while feeding into a massive,
    crowd-powered transcription engine that has digitized 13 million articles from
    The New York Times archives. But perhaps the best known example of human computation
    is Wikipedia. Despite initial concerns about accuracy, it has become the key resource
    for all kinds of basic information. Information science has begun to build on
    these early successes, demonstrating the potential to evolve human computation
    systems that can model and address wicked problems (those that defy traditional
    problem-solving methods) at the intersection of economic, environmental, and sociopolitical
    systems.

  abstract: 'This book presents a comprehensive approach to protecting sensitive information
    when large data collections are released by their owners. It addresses three key
    requirements of data privacy: the protection of data explicitly released, the
    protection of information not explicitly released but potentially vulnerable due
    to a release of other data, and the enforcement of owner-defined access restrictions
    to the released data. It is also the first book with a complete examination of
    how to enforce dynamic read and write access authorizations on released data,
    applicable to the emerging data outsourcing and cloud computing situations. Private
    companies, public organizations and final users are releasing, sharing, and disseminating
    their data to take reciprocal advantage of the great benefits of making their
    data available to others. This book weighs these benefits against the potential
    privacy risks. A detailed analysis of recent techniques for privacy protection
    in data release and case studies illustrate crucial scenarios. Protecting Privacy
    in Data Release targets researchers, professionals and government employees working
    in security and privacy. Advanced-level students in computer science and electrical
    engineering will also find this book useful as a secondary text or reference.'

  abstract: "​This book will provide one of the first comprehensive approaches to
    the study of smart city governments with theories and concepts for understanding
    and researching 21st century city governments innovative methodologies for the
    analysis and evaluation of smart city initiatives. The term “smart city” is now
    generally used to represent efforts that in different ways describe a comprehensive
    vision of a city for the present and future. A smarter city infuses information
    into its physical infrastructure to improve conveniences, facilitate mobility,
    add efficiencies, conserve energy, improve the quality of air and water, identify
    problems and fix them quickly, recover rapidly from disasters, collect data to
    make better decisions, deploy resources effectively and share data to enable collaboration
    across entities and domains. These and other similar efforts are expected to make
    cities more intelligent in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, productivity, transparency,
    and sustainability, among other important aspects. Given this changing social,
    institutional and technology environment, it seems feasible and likeable to attain
    smarter cities and by extension, smarter governments: virtually integrated, networked,
    interconnected, responsive, and efficient. This book will help build the bridge
    between sound research and practice expertise in the area of smarter cities and
    will be of interest to researchers and students in the e-government, public administration,
    political science, communication, information science, administrative sciences
    and management, sociology, computer science, and information technology. As well
    as government officials and public managers who will find practical recommendations
    based on rigorous studies that will contain insights and guidance for the development,
    management, and evaluation of complex smart cities and smart government initiatives.​"

  abstract: 'This article argues that many contemporary e-democracy projects, particularly
    in the United States, have at their heart a model of atomistic, independent, rational,
    and general-interest citizens. As such, these projects, variously grouped under
    the labels of e-governance, online deliberation, open government, and civic technology,
    often assume a broad shared consensus about collective definitions of “public
    problems” that both does not exist and sidesteps debates over what these problems
    are and what potential solutions can and should be. Drawing on recent theories
    of political parties, social identity, and cultural cognition, this article argues
    that e-democracy efforts need to account for the fact that the citizens practitioners
    appeal to see themselves by default as members of social groups, and that this
    has implications for politics and what Jasanoff calls “civic epistemology.” Presenting
    the case of attempting to change Republican opinions about climate change, I argue
    that e-democracy initiatives should seek to foster collaboration and deliberation
    within, not between, parties and among partisans. To do so, e-democratic reformers
    need to explicitly structure the collaborative and deliberative environment so
    there is a range of intra-party opinions and beliefs as part of the consultative
    and policy-making process.

  abstract: |-
    This research, carried out by WaterAid, Itad and IRC, explores the factors that facilitate and inhibit the success of ICT-based reporting mechanisms in water supply sustainability.

    Access to water supply around the world is increasing, but poor sustainability of water supply services remains a key barrier, particularly in rural areas. In response to this, a growing number of information and communication technology (ICT) initiatives aim to improve the monitoring and functionality of water supply.

    The research examines evidence from two water supply monitoring systems involving ICTs in Uganda and Timor Leste. This policy briefing shares some of the lessons from the research on the effectiveness of the initiatives and provides recommendations for governments and organisations planning to develop ICT initiatives to improve rural water supply.

  abstract: How can creative individuals and societies adapt to complex 21st-century
    conditions? Will civilizations thrive or collapse in the decades to come if they
    are not creative enough, or if they are too creative? Interest in these questions
    is growing; however, until now there has been inadequate understanding of the
    socioeconomic and cultural trends and issues that influence creativity. This book
    provides that understanding while yielding insights from many of the world’s leading
    creativity researchers and educational experts. The book begins with a big-picture,
    interdisciplinary overview of the socioeconomic, cultural, and technological pressures
    emerging from 21st-century globalization and describes some ways in which those
    pressures simultaneously suppress, distort, and invigorate creativity in general,
    and creative education in particular. After that, prominent scholars of creativity
    and education use their impressive knowledge bases to clarify how we can adjust
    our thoughts and actions in order to give ourselves the best possible chances
    for success in this complex world.

  abstract: 'The Maastricht Treaty (the “Treaty”) first introduced the status of EU
    citizenship. The twentieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty, marked in
    2013, was declared the European Year of the Citizen. Union citizenship has been
    understood as the world’s first post-national citizenship, although it is still
    complementary to national citizenships. EU citizens enjoy rights that have been
    expanded, modified, and reinterpreted in light of the EU integration process.
    The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has been a driving force in
    this process. This twentieth anniversary has provided the occasio for this special
    issue. Indeed, much has happened over the last two decades. The Maastricht Treaty
    entered into force on the heels of German reunification, and afterwards, a series
    of EU treaties followed: The Amsterdam Treaty, the Nice Charter of Fundamental
    Rights, the aborted constitutionalization process and the Rome Treaty in 2004,
    and the Treaty of Lisbon. The Euro took over former national currencies in 2002;
    the enlargement process led to today’s twenty-eight Member States. But the ratio
    of this special issue is based on other events as linked to the 2008 financial
    crisis, bailouts, the fiscal compact, and similar measures. In a nutshell, the
    timeliness of this volume is linked to the current financial disarray. Since prognosis
    presupposes diagnosis, no further words are necessary as to the importance of
    this task. It is (almost) self-evident that before taking action and preparing
    for the future, one needs to address the very first question: Nosce te ipsum or
    know thyself. Union citizens need to take a step back and ask what they need to
    be and who they want to become.'

  abstract: As government administrative data sets are increasingly made available
    for new (non-administrative) purposes, there is a need to improve access to such
    resources for voluntary and community organizations, social enterprises and private
    businesses for statistical analysis and evaluation purposes. The Justice Data
    Lab set up by the Ministry of Justice in the UK presents an innovative case of
    how administrative data can be linked to other data held by organizations delivering
    public services. The establishment of a unit within a secure setting holding evaluation
    and statistical expertise has enabled providers of programmes aimed at reducing
    re-offending to obtain evidence on how the impact of their interventions differs
    from that of a matched comparison group. This article explores the development
    of the Justice Data Lab, the methodological and other challenges faced, and the
    experiences of user organizations. The article draws out implications for future
    development of Data Labs and the use of administrative data for the evaluation
    of public services.

    T4T&A (tech for transparency and accountability) initiatives intend to make the public functioning of government visible, and states accountable to citizens for their actions. This summary presents findings and reflections from two studies of how marginalised communities use technologies commonly applied in T4T&A work, and the limits of this use. The research is intended to inform communities of practice around T4T&A initiatives: technologists, managers, donors, community-based activists and researchers.

    This document summarises researcher gathered by interviewing respondents in two marginalised communities – lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) people in Nairobi, Kenya, and economically marginalised housing and urban development rights activists in Johannesburg, South Africa.

    A new generation of strategies for government accountability is needed, one that fully considers entrenched, institutional obstacles to change. Vertical integration of coordinated civil society policy monitoring and advocacy is one such strategy. Engaging each stage and level of public sector actions in an integrated way can locate the causes of accountability failures, show their interconnected nature, and leverage the local, national and transnational power shifts necessary to produce sustainable institutional change.

    This case study summary is one of seven that reflect on civil society monitoring and advocacy initiatives in the Philippines – all of which aim to improve government accountability in different sectors – through the lens of vertical integration.

    The Philippines has a mining law that is contested by several sectors due to the inadequate environmental protection it offers lands and communities. The law allows forest clearance, free exploitation of water, easement rights, and the use of explosives with low fees and penalties.  It does not protect the rights of mining-affected communities, nor does it recognise the ownership of natural resources by indigenous peoples.

  abstract: "In a post-Brexit world with populists on the rise, trust in government
    and politicians is in short supply. People claim to be tired of ‘experts’ and
    the divide between facts and opinion has been blurred. The art of offering simple
    solutions to complex problems is tipping the scale away from nuanced, multifaceted
    answers founded on compromise. \n\nWithin this context, governments nonetheless
    need to make difficult decisions, whether it is developing budgets, aligning priorities,
    or designing long-term projects. It is often impossible to make everybody happy,
    and the messy business of weighing trade-offs takes place. \n\nWhile sometimes
    these tricky policy dilemmas are relegated to independent commissions or inquiries,
    or lately to referendums, a better method exists for solving them. This study
    of almost 50 long-form deliberative processes in Canada and Australia makes the
    case that adding informed citizen voices to public decision-making leads to more
    effective policies. By putting the problem to the people, giving them information,
    time to discuss the options, to find common ground and to decide what they want,
    public bodies gain the legitimacy to act on hard choices."

  abstract: |-
    Smart cities are a new vision for urban development.  They integrate information and communication technology infrastructures – in the domains of artificial intelligence, distributed and cloud computing, and sensor networks – into a city, to facilitate quality of life for its citizens and sustainable growth.  This book explores various concepts for the development of these new technologies (including agent-oriented programming, broadband infrastructures, wireless sensor networks, Internet-based networked applications, open data and open platforms), and how they can provide smart services and enablers in a range of public domains.

    The most significant research, both established and emerging, is brought together to enable academics and practitioners to investigate the possibilities of smart cities, and to generate the knowledge and solutions required to develop and maintain them.

  abstract: 'In recent years, ''Nudge Units'' or ''Behavioral Insights Teams'' have
    been created in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and other nations.
    All over the world, public officials are using the behavioral sciences to protect
    the environment, promote employment and economic growth, reduce poverty, and increase
    national security. In this book, Cass R. Sunstein, the eminent legal scholar and
    best-selling co-author of Nudge (2008), breaks new ground with a deep yet highly
    readable investigation into the ethical issues surrounding nudges, choice architecture,
    and mandates, addressing such issues as welfare, autonomy, self-government, dignity,
    manipulation, and the constraints and responsibilities of an ethical state. Complementing
    the ethical discussion, The Ethics of Influence: Government in the Age of Behavioral
    Science contains a wealth of new data on people''s attitudes towards a broad range
    of nudges, choice architecture, and mandates.'

    Here, using a football stadium and an airport as case studies, we present evidence
    of a strong relationship between the number of people in restricted areas and
    activity recorded by mobile phone providers and the online service Twitter. Our
    findings suggest that data generated through our interactions with mobile phone
    networks and the Internet may allow us to gain valuable measurements of the current

  abstract: Nigeria has over the years survived majorly by the exploration and exporting
    of crude oil. Wealth generated from crude oil has been responsible for virtually
    everything in Nigeria, ranging from politics, debate on resource allocation, manipulation
    of primordial sentiments leading to myriad of challenges that have made the formation
    of national identity elusive. This study is therefore an attempt to enhance are-focusing
    of Nigeria on data as the new oil that canaid development. The vast data generated
    through the social media must be mined and further extracted, processed and analyzed
    for policy determination using ICT tools and techniques. The study adopted the
    resource curse theory as its theoretical framework of analysis to explain the
    contradiction of poverty in the midst of the  abundance of natural resources in
    Nigeria and the urgent need for refocusing on the use of data as a way of collecting
    feedback from people. The data for the study  were  collected  from  secondary  sources  such
    as published materials, and internet sources. The study revealed that there are
    possibilities of a data-driven decision making in the nation. Proper data analysis
    will definitely make governance SMART–creation of simple policies, measurable
    plans, attainable procedures, relevant programmes and timely delivery of projects.

  abstract: The continual advancement of internet technologies has led to the evolution
    of how individuals and organizations operate. For example, through the internet,
    we can now tap a remote workforce to help us accomplish certain tasks, a phenomenon
    called crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing is an approach that relies on people to perform
    activities that are costly or time-consuming using traditional methods. Depending
    on the incentive given to the crowd workers, crowdsourcing can be classified as
    paid or unpaid. In paid crowdsourcing, the workers are incentivized financially,
    enabling the formation of a robust workforce, which allows fast completion of
    tasks. Consequently, in unpaid crowdsourcing, the lack of financial incentive
    potentially leads to an unpredictable workforce and indeterminable task completion
    time. However, since payment to workers is not necessary, it can be an economical
    alternative for individuals and organizations who are more concerned about the
    budget than the task turnaround time. In this study, we explore unpaid crowdsourcing
    by reviewing crowdsourcing applications where the crowd comes from a pool of volunteers.
    We also evaluate its performance in sentiment analysis and data extraction projects.
    Our findings suggest that for such tasks, unpaid crowdsourcing completes slower
    but yields results of similar or higher quality compared to its paid counterpart.

  abstract: Can data from mobile phones be used to observe economic shocks and their
    consequences at multiple scales? Here we present novel methods to detect mass
    layoffs, identify individuals affected by them, and predict changes in aggregate
    unemployment rates using call detail records (CDRs) from mobile phones. Using
    the closure of a large manufacturing plant as a case study, we first describe
    a structural break model to correctly detect the date of a mass layoff and estimate
    its size. We then use a Bayesian classification model to identify affected individuals
    by observing changes in calling behavior following the plant's closure. For these
    affected individuals, we observe significant declines in social behavior and mobility
    following job loss. Using the features identified at the micro level, we show
    that the same changes in these calling behaviors, aggregated at the regional level,
    can improve forecasts of macro unemployment rates. These methods and results highlight
    promise of new data resources to measure micro economic behavior and improve estimates
    of critical economic indicators.

  abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning provide
    us with the tools to build predictive models that can be used to unveil patterns
    driving judicial decisions. This can be useful, for both lawyers and judges, as
    an assisting tool to rapidly identify cases and extract patterns which lead to
    certain decisions. This paper presents the first systematic study on predicting
    the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights based solely
    on textual content. We formulate a binary classification task where the input
    of our classifiers is the textual content extracted from a case and the target
    output is the actual judgment as to whether there has been a violation of an article
    of the convention of human rights. Textual information is represented using contiguous
    word sequences, i.e., N-grams, and topics. Our models can predict the court’s
    decisions with a strong accuracy (79% on average). Our empirical analysis indicates
    that the formal facts of a case are the most important predictive factor. This
    is consistent with the theory of legal realism suggesting that judicial decision-making
    is significantly affected by the stimulus of the facts. We also observe that the
    topical content of a case is another important feature in this classification
    task and explore this relationship further by conducting a qualitative analysis.

  abstract: |-
    Secondary healthcare systems around the world are facing ever increasing pressures and governments frequently revise the provision of important services, often without available data or studies necessary to understand the demand placed on clinical teams. The situation is particularly severe during Out of Hours (OoH) settings, which account for over 75% of the working week. Here, doctors work in a stressful environment, performing complex tasks and making difficult prioritisation decisions.

    In this work, we discuss methodology and applications demonstrating the potential of data science and machine learning, in order to design intelligent systems capable of informing, supporting and driving improvements in health care policy and management. For that matter, we introduce the use of combined location and tasking informatics, sourcing diverse data allowing for the study of clinical behaviour and workload patterns in OoH secondary care settings; and we review example applications and ongoing work on Bayesian statistics, graphical models and queueing networks.

    Specifically, we exploit comprehensive data for the purposes of location identification and evaluation of task demand and workload. And we show it is possible to gain valuable information for the purposes of rota scheduling, task prioritisation or resource allocation, among other things.

  abstract: "The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) has been sold
    by its advocates as a badly needed way to enhance access to information in the
    extractive industries sector and improve government accountability. It has also
    been lauded as enabling energy companies to demonstrate their responsibility and
    sustainability, enabling countries to attract more foreign investment, and enabling
    communities to engage in dialogue with national planners over energy issues. In
    this paper, we ask: does it work? Do countries adhering to EITI standards actually
    see selected governance metrics improve? To answer this question, this article
    first briefly summarizes the history of the EITI and details the hypothetical
    benefits espoused by its supporters. It then proceeds to “test” these benefits
    by qualitatively assessing the performance of EITI for the first two countries
    to achieve candidacy, Azerbaijan and Liberia. The paper finds that while the EITI
    affirms the salience of reliable information and data about the extractive industries,
    it is difficult to attribute governance improvements casually to the EITI. Moreover,
    the EITI reveals an inherent paradox about the virtues of transparency and also
    underscores that much of the damage from mining and hydrocarbon development is
    socially and economically unavoidable. \n\nDoes transparency matter? Evaluating

  abstract: "Deliberation is the process by which a group of people, each with equal
    voice, can - via a process of discussion and debate - reach an agreement. \n \n
    This book attempts to do two things. First, it rethinks the role of deliberation
    in development and shows that it has potential well beyond a narrow focus on participatory
    projects. Deliberation, if properly instituted, has the potential to have a transformative
    effect on many if not all aspects of development, and especially in addressing
    problems of collective action, coordination, and entrenched inequality. This has
    broad implications both at the global and local level. \n \n Second, the book
    demonstrates that taking deliberation seriously calls for a different approach
    to both research and policy design and requires a much greater emphasis on the
    processes by which decisions are made, rather than an exclusive focus on the outcomes.
    Deliberation and Development contributes to a broader literature to understand
    the role of communicative processes in development."

  abstract: |-
    Big Data has become increasingly popular in recent years. Before the mid-2000s, it was not
     a major topic, especially when compared with the topic of e-government. However, between
     January 2010 and March 2016, the volume of Google searches for the term increased almost
     16 times, while the search volume for e-government continued to decline. By March 2016,
     the search volume for e-government was only three percent of the searches for Big Data.
     Big Data refers to the use of a massive amount of data to conduct analyses so that the data
     patterns and relationships can be used for classification, clustering, anomaly detection, prediction,
     and other needs in decision making (TechAmerica Foundation 2012). Because data
     collection devices—including scanners, mobile devices, sensors, digital cameras, and radiofrequency
     identification (RFID) devices—have become easily accessible and widely used in
     our daily life, digital records of individual and public activities have grown exponentially over
     time. The internet, especially through broadband and wireless networks, also allows the easy
     and continuous transmission of machine data. Transmission logs and network status have
     also become new forms of Big Data (Power 2014). As a result of all these developments,
     observers of the movement to Big Data suggest that we are already in the zettabyte era, and
     by 2020, the world is estimated to have about 40 zettabytes of data (IDC 2014).

  abstract: The current paper focuses on the emerging problem of the management of
    and the processing required for the massive amounts of interdisciplinary data
    produced nowadays. As it becomes apparent that “the truth and the useful information
    is drowned in a sea of irrelevance due to the vast amount of information available”1,
    there are strong indications that seemingly irrelevant co-occurrences of events
    and subtle links between them may form pieces of the same puzzle that complement
    each other towards the revealment of predictive or explanatory indicators for
    many sectors of the modern economy. To this direction, modern technologies like
    data mining, data and visual analytics, artificial intelligence, etc. can be of
    significant value, if offering a comprehensive communication of potentially useful
    information to the appropriate stake holders and/or policy-makers. In this context,a
    multi-purpose platform for data analytics is briefly exhibited in order to demonstrate
    the potential of such approaches to policy making.

  abstract: The study analyses industry participation in FP6 and FP7, based on an
    extensive literature review, the analysis of CORDA data corroborated by a counterfactual
    evaluation, interviews with participants, case studies and feedback from an expert
    workshop. The results show that industry participation has increased with respect
    to previous programmes, for both large companies and SMEs, with a particular concentration
    on high-tech sectors. The key factors for participation, as well as the reasons
    behind the different levels in different themes, appear to be more related to
    the strategic alignment of the programme and companies’ priorities, than to operational
    issues such as administrative burden, success rates and participation costs. The
    study then presents the impact of FP on innovation, in terms of direct, indirect
    and behavioural additionality, and the related barriers, mainly related to the
    lack of flexibility during the project implementation. In terms of job creation,
    based on a counterfactual impact evaluation the results show that FP helped to
    create on average 2 new jobs per each company. Finally, conclusions and policy
    recommendations are presented, taking into account the innovations introduced
    by H2020

  abstract: 'The opening of government data, in order to have both social and economic
    value generated from them, has attracted the attention and interest of both researchers
    and practitioners from various disciplines, such as information systems, management
    sciences, political and social sciences, and law. Despite the rapid growth of
    this multidisciplinary research domain, which has led to the emergence and continuous
    evolution of technologies and management approaches for open government data (OGD),
    a detailed analysis of the specific areas and topics of this research is still
    missing. In this paper, a detailed taxonomy of research areas and corresponding
    research topics of the OGD domain is presented: it includes four main research
    areas (ODG management & policies, infrastructures, interoperability and usage
    & value), which are further analysed into 35 research topics. An important advantage
    of this taxonomy, beyond its high level of detail, is that it has been developed
    through extraction and combination of relevant knowledge from three different
    kinds of sources: important relevant government policy documents, research literature,
    and experts. For each of the 35 research topics we have identified, its research
    literature is summarized and main research objectives and directions are highlighted.
    Based on the above taxonomy, an extension of the extant OGD lifecycle is advanced;
    also, under-researched topics that require further research are identified.'

  abstract: The digital exhaust left by flows of physical and digital commodities
    provides a rich measure of the nature, strength and significance of relationships
    between countries in the global network. With this work, we examine how these
    traces and the network structure can reveal the socioeconomic profile of different
    countries. We take into account multiple international networks of physical and
    digital flows, including the previously unexplored international postal network.
    By measuring the position of each country in the Trade, Postal, Migration, International
    Flights, IP and Digital Communications networks, we are able to build proxies
    for a number of crucial socioeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita and the
    Human Development Index ranking along with twelve other indicators used as benchmarks
    of national well-being by the United Nations and other international organisations.
    In this context, we have also proposed and evaluated a global connectivity degree
    measure applying multiplex theory across the six networks that accounts for the
    strength of relationships between countries. We conclude by showing how countries
    with shared community membership over multiple networks have similar socioeconomic
    profiles. Combining multiple flow data sources can help understand the forces
    which drive economic activity on a global level. Such an ability to infer proxy
    indicators in a context of incomplete information is extremely timely in light
    of recent discussions on measurement of indicators relevant to the Sustainable
    Development Goals.

  abstract: Could social media data aid in disaster response and damage assessment?
    Countries face both an increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters
    due to climate change. And during such events, citizens are turning to social
    media platforms for disaster-related communication and information. Social media
    improves situational awareness, facilitates dissemination of emergency information,
    enables early warning systems, and helps coordinate relief efforts. Additionally,
    spatiotemporal distribution of disaster-related messages helps with real-time
    monitoring and assessment of the disaster itself. Here we present a multiscale
    analysis of Twitter activity before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. We examine
    the online response of 50 metropolitan areas of the United States and find a strong
    relationship between proximity to Sandy’s path and hurricanerelated social media
    activity. We show that real and perceived threats – together with the physical
    disaster effects – are directly observable through the intensity and composition
    of Twitter’s message stream. We demonstrate that per-capita Twitter activity strongly
    correlates with the per-capita economic damage inflicted by the hurricane. Our
    findings suggest that massive online social networks can be used for rapid assessment
    (“nowcasting”) of damage caused by a large-scale disaster.

  abstract: The document discusses the meaning, implications and origins of Open Government
    Data. I suggest that the current conceptualization of OGD has been informed by
    New Public Management theory, which has led to frameworks more focused on creating
    economic value than enabling a more substantive relationship between the state
    and its citizens. By counting the frequency of 77 keywords throughout 32 OGD-related
    documents, I assess the balance in the objectives pursued by Argentina, Colombia,
    Chile, Mexico, US, UK. The analysis shows the UK and US policies are more focused
    on wealth creation than their Latin American counterparts, where references to
    justice, equality and other transformative keywords are more frequent. The essay
    concludes with a call for more resources to be invested into identifying the potential
    losers that will result from OGD policies, and how cross-compensations between
    winners and losers can be carried out to achieve just and more legitimate outcomes.
    I argue the Legislative is better placed than the Executive to define the broader
    OGD frameworks given that the Legislative is usually empowered with the task of
    modifying taxes and public expenditure. Thus, the Legislative can take into account
    the disruptions caused by OGD in particular, and the information era in general
    when defining taxation and expenditure.

  abstract: Volunteered geographical information (VGI) and citizen science have become
    important sources data for much scientific research. In the domain of land cover,
    crowdsourcing can provide a high temporal resolution data to support different
    analyses of landscape processes. However, the scientists may have little control
    over what gets recorded by the crowd, providing a potential source of error and
    uncertainty. This study compared analyses of crowdsourced land cover data that
    were contributed by different groups, based on nationality (labelled Gondor and
    Non-Gondor) and on domain experience (labelled Expert and Non-Expert). The analyses
    used a geographically weighted model to generate maps of land cover and compared
    the maps generated by the different groups. The results highlight the differences
    between the maps how specific land cover classes were under- and over-estimated.
    As crowdsourced data and citizen science are increasingly used to replace data
    collected under the designed experiment, this paper highlights the importance
    of considering between group variations and their impacts on the results of analyses.
    Critically, differences in the way that landscape features are conceptualised
    by different groups of contributors need to be considered when using crowdsourced
    data in formal scientific analyses. The discussion considers the potential for
    variation in crowdsourced data, the relativist nature of land cover and suggests
    a number of areas for future research. The key finding is that the veracity of
    citizen science data is not the critical issue per se. Rather, it is important
    to consider the impacts of differences in the semantics, affordances and functions

    Which source of information contains greater bias and slant—text written by an expert or that
    constructed via collective intelligence? Do the costs of acquiring, storing, displaying and revising
    information shape those differences? We evaluate these questions empirically by examining slanted
    and biased phrases in content on US political issues from two sources—Encyclopædia Britannica
    and Wikipedia. Our overall slant measure is less (more) than zero when an article leans towards
    Democrat (Republican) viewpoints, while bias is the absolute value of the slant. Using a matched
    sample of pairs of articles from Britannica and Wikipedia, we show that, overall, Wikipedia articles
    are more slanted towards Democrat than Britannica articles, as well as more biased. Slanted
    Wikipedia articles tend to become less biased than Britannica articles on the same topic as they
    become substantially revised, and the bias on a per word basis hardly differs between the sources.
    These results have implications for the segregation of readers in online sources and the allocation of
    editorial resources in online sources using collective intelligence.

  abstract: There has been much attention paid to the idea of Smart Cities as researchers
    have sought to define and characterize the main aspects of the concept, including
    the role of creative industries in urban growth, the importance of social capital
    in urban development, and the role of urban sustainability. This book develops
    a critical view of the Smart City concept, the incentives and role of governments
    in promoting the development of Smart Cities and the analysis of experiences of
    e-government projects addressed to enhance Smart Cities. This book further analyzes
    the perceptions of stakeholders, such as public managers or politicians, regarding
    the incentives and role of governments in Smart Cities and the critical analysis
    of e-government projects to promote Smart Cities’ development, making the book
    valuable to academics, researchers, policy-makers, public managers, international
    organizations and technical experts in understanding the role of government to
    enhance Smart Cities’ projects.

  abstract: |-
    Access to information, freedom of media and citizen participation in governance processes are some of the main pillars of the Kenyan Constitution. Therefore, the open data initiative holds the potential for increased engagement between the government and the public. Evans & Campos (2012) note that greater citizen empowerment could be achieved through more concerted approaches that consider and provide contextual information. This research sought to understand how this relationship has evolved over the years since the initiative’s inception, and to address potential areas of improvement to allow for greater utilization of government information by the communities. More speci cally, the study sought to:
    a) Investigate the impact of the Kenyan Government’s open data initiative and to see whether, and if so how, it is assisting marginalized communities and groups in accessing key social services and information such as health and education;11
    b) Understand the way people use the information provided by the Open Data Initiative;
    c) Identify people’s trust in the information and how it can assist their day-to-day lives;
    d) Examine ways in which the public wish for the open data initiative to improve, particularly in relation to governance and service delivery

  abstract: 'Despite the longstanding centrality of agricultural productivity growth
    as a development goal, reliable productivity measures remain elusive and costly.
    Crop yield is widely used as the primary productivity indicator, though it ignores
    inputs other than land and can be a poor proxy, particularly for smallholder and
    women farmers who are more likely to farm marginal lands and to grow multiple
    crops on the same plot, practices which complicate per hectare yield measurement.
    Crop yield is commonly calculated as a measure of production per harvested area,
    rather than production on the full area planted to the crop. Yet small-scale farmers
    are more likely to experience a loss in crop area between planting and harvesting,
    leading to systematic overestimation of mean crop yields so long as the null production
    on abandoned cropland goes unaccounted for. As a result, common yield measures
    may not be reliable indicators of aggregate agricultural productivity among smallholder
    farmers. We use plot-level data from the Tanzania National Panel Survey to investigate
    the conditions and crops for which the choice of yield measure might introduce
    significant error into crop yield estimates, and thereby bias research findings.
    We focus on three crops: maize, rice, and sorghum. We find that the choice of
    yield measure may lead to consistent under- or over-estimates of yield for sub-populations
    and crops that experience frequent and substantial losses in plot area between
    planting and harvest, with implications for the design of policy interventions
    to increase agricultural productivity and to target the least productive and poorest
    farmers.  '

    Information and communications technologies (ICTs) and data play an increasingly visible role in transparency and accountability initiatives (TAIs). There has been little research on how the selection of ICT tools influences the success of these initiatives. This might involve using social media to track parliamentary performance, mobile phones to conduct satisfaction surveys on public service delivery, reporting websites to document corruption, or radio to promote and facilitate political debate.

    This article reports on research into TAI tool selection processes in South Africa and Kenya. Findings suggest that in many cases, tools are chosen with only limited testing of their appropriateness for the intended users in the intended contexts, despite widespread recognition among practitioners, funders and researchers that this carries significant efficiency and sustainability risks. The authors conclude by suggesting a strategy for increasing investment and effort in tool selection, in order to conserve overall project resources and minimise the risk of failure.

  abstract: Reflecting on the governance of smart cities, the state-of-the-art this
    paper advances offers a critique of recent city ranking and future Internet accounts
    of their development. Armed with these critical insights, it goes on to explain
    smart cities in terms of the social networks, cultural attributes and environmental
    capacities, vis-a-vis, vital ecologies of the intellectual capital, wealth creation
    and standards of participatory governance regulating their development. The Triple
    Helix model which the paper advances to explain these performances in turn suggests
    that cities are smart when the ICTs of future Internet developments successfully
    embed the networks society needs for them to not only generate intellectual capital,
    or create wealth, but also cultivate the environmental capacity, ecology and vitality
    of those spaces which the direct democracy of their participatory governance open
    up, add value to and construct.

    Much of  the literature on accountability focuses on citizen voices, but this article argues that there is a need to bring more of the state back into the equation. Here the authors chose to look at the state and see when and how it listens, to which actors; and why, at times, it chooses not to listen.

    The article looks at four cases of key historical policies in Ghana (national health insurance), Kenya (digitalisation of governance), South Africa (social protection) and Tanzania (primary education), to examine how states engage with citizen voices. The policies all took place in contexts of political change and major junctures of democratisation.

  abstract: "Why do policies and business practices that ignore the moral and generous
    side of human nature often fail?\n \n Should the idea of economic man—the amoral
    and self-interested Homo economicus—determine how we expect people to respond
    to monetary rewards, punishments, and other incentives? Samuel Bowles answers
    with a resounding “no.” Policies that follow from this paradigm, he shows, may
    “crowd out” ethical and generous motives and thus backfire.\n \n But incentives
    per se are not really the culprit. Bowles shows that crowding out occurs when
    the message conveyed by fines and rewards is that self-interest is expected, that
    the employer thinks the workforce is lazy, or that the citizen cannot otherwise
    be trusted to contribute to the public good. Using historical and recent case
    studies as well as behavioral experiments, Bowles shows how well-designed incentives
    can crowd in the civic motives on which good governance depends."

  abstract: New, “big” data sources allow measurement of city characteristics and
    outcome variables higher frequencies and finer geographic scales than ever before.
    However, big data will not solve large urban social science questions on its own.
    Big data has the most value for the study of cities when it allows measurement
    of the previously opaque, or when it can be coupled with exogenous shocks to people
    or place. We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they
    can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google
    Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting
    that similar image data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured
    areas of the developing world. We then discuss how survey techniques can be improved
    to better measure willingness to pay for urban amenities. Finally, we explain
    how Internet data is being used to improve the quality of city services.

  abstract: |-
    This paper provides an introduction to collective intelligence in government. It aims to be useful and relevant to governments of countries at very different levels of development. It highlights the ways in which governments are better understanding the world around them, drawing on ideas and expertise from their citizens, and encouraging greater scrutiny of their actions.

    Collective intelligence is a new term to describe something which is in some respects old, but in other respects changing dramatically thanks to advances in digital technologies. It refers to the ability of large groups - a community, region, city or nation - to think and act intelligently in a way that amounts to more than the sum of their parts.

  abstract: 'This report discusses the use and governance of spatial data in Amsterdam''s
    smart city projects. How much does spatial data tell the city about its people,
    and how is that likely to change in the next decade? The project focuses especially
    on those who may be marginalised or challenged by increasing visibility due to
    the use of big data in the future smart city: various groups were interviewed
    including immigrants, children, sex workers, opt-outs of smart technologies, and
    technology developers. They were asked how they felt about their personal ''data-sphere'',
    the level of data-awareness and the kind of consultation they would like to see
    as citizens of a smart city, and how they felt about increasing interaction between
    the city and private-sector partners around digital data. The report presents
    a social roadmap for the datafied city''s future, and addresses the question of
    how the city can build an inclusive and responsive spatial data governance infrastructure.'

  abstract: Many governments have recently begun to adopt the concept of open innovation.
    However, studies on the openness of government data and its effect on the global
    competitiveness have not received much attention. Therefore, this study aims to
    investigate the effects of government data openness on a knowledge-based economy
    at the government level. The proposed model was analyzed using secondary data
    collected from three different reports. The findings indicate that government
    data openness positively affects the formation of knowledge bases in a country
    and that the level of knowledge base of a country positively affects the global
    competitiveness of a country.

  abstract: Advances in communication and computational technology have drastically
    increased opportunities for the public to participate in governing activities.
    Well-designed responsive participatory pathways can encourage individuals to take
    action on issues that are important to them while receiving value and enjoyment
    in contributing to the overall welfare of the state. However, many crowdsourcing
    programs do not achieve their intended targets or goals in part because people
    have little motivation to participate. Serious games are examined to address this
    challenge as they involve the integration of intrinsic human motivators with game
    mechanics or game dynamics into a website, service, community, campaign, or application
    to drive participation and engagement. Governments can supplement open governance
    platforms with characteristics of games to reshape and invigorate public participation
    if individuals have opportunities to participate through channels that are collectively
    and individually rewarding. Drawing on theory and an emerging body of examples
    this manuscript creates a framework for how governance organizations can integrate
    serious games into the design of open governance platforms to improve the understanding
    of how the platform affects the working relationship with the public when solving
    collective challenges. Contributions of serious games are how to foster dialog,
    educate, solicit feedback, and mobilize individuals. In identifying the characteristics
    that differentiate early projects that have succeeded with those that have struggled,
    we provide recommendations of how to cultivate voluntary and enthusiastic participation
    in open governance platforms– giving the public the opportunity and motivation
    to have an impact on the communities in which they live just as many already do
    in the virtual worlds in which they play.

  abstract: "A core failing of today’s administrative state and modern administrative
    law scholarship is the lack of imagination as to how agencies should operate.
    On the conventional telling, public agencies follow specific grants of regulatory
    authority, use the traditional tools of notice-and-comment rulemaking and adjudication,
    and are checked by judicial review. In reality, however, effective administration
    depends on entrepreneurial leadership that spearheads policy experimentation and
    trial-and-error problem-solving, including the development of regulatory programs
    that use non-traditional tools. \n\nEntrepreneurial administration takes place
    both at public agencies and private entities, each of which can address regulatory
    challenges and earn regulatory authority as a result. Consider, for example, that
    Energy Star, a successful program that has encouraged the manufacture and sale
    of energy efficient appliances, is developed and overseen by the Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA). After the EPA established the program, Congress later
    codified it and, eventually, other countries followed suit. By contrast, the successful
    and complementary program encouraging the construction of energy efficient buildings,
    the well-respected LEED standard, is developed and overseen by a private organization.
    After it was developed, a number of governmental authorities endorsed it and have
    encouraged LEED-certified construction projects with both carrots and sticks.
    Significantly, while neither the Energy Star nor the LEED program were originally
    anticipated by any regulatory statute, both have had a tremendous impact. \n\nThe
    Energy Star and LEED case studies exemplify the sort of innovative regulatory
    strategies that are taking root in the modern administrative state. Despite the
    importance of entrepreneurial administration in practice, scholars have failed
    to examine the role of entrepreneurial leadership in spurring policy innovation
    and earning regulatory authority for an agency (or private entity). In short,
    administrative law needs a richer and more textured account of agency action,
    why entrepreneurial leadership matters in government, and how agencies should
    operate.\n\nThis Article explains that the conventional view of agency behavior
    — either following the specific direction of Congress or the President to use
    notice-and-comment rulemaking or adjudication processes — does not adequately
    portray how public agencies and private entities develop innovative regulatory
    strategies and earn regulatory authority as a result. In particular, this Article
    explains how governmental agencies like the EPA or private entities like the Green
    Building Council (which oversees the LEED standard) depend on entrepreneurial
    leadership to develop experimental regulatory strategies. It also explains how,
    in the wake of such experiments, legislative bodies have the opportunity to evaluate
    regulatory innovations in practice before deciding whether to embrace, revise,
    reject, or merely tolerate them. \n\nThis Article highlights the importance of
    entrepreneurial leadership in government, providing a number of examples of emerging
    regulatory experiments and suggesting how Congress should evaluate such experiments.
    This discussion explains how entrepreneurial leadership and a culture of experimentation
    and trial-and-error learning is necessary to develop innovative strategies and
    overcome the pressure to manage the status quo. In so doing, the Article underscores
    how policy entrepreneurship is integral to agency effectiveness, an important
    corrective to public choice theory, and a missing piece of modern administrative
    law scholarship."

  abstract: |-
    Since the implementation of the first Open Government Partnership National Action Plan (OGP-NAP) in Uruguay in 2012, open government has evolved from a focus on e-government that was non-participatory, towards a multi-stakeholder, transversal approach to public policies, with its own budget allocation. This and subsequent NAPs have incorporated citizen engagement in its objectives to improve government transparency, accountability and responsiveness, and have been developed though a multi-stakeholder consultation process.

    This case study examined whether the ICT-supported citizen engagement processes underpinning OGP-NAPs have transformed democratic governance or whether they remain a superficial exercise to reinforce politically correct visions of open government. The key focus of analysis was the bargaining process among stakeholders – how different actors were able to adapt and collaborate to develop the course of action.

  abstract: 'The valuation of multiple ecosystem services requires the design of valuation
    processes able to integrate different dimensions of value and to cope with complexity.
    Following the “value-articulating institution” framework, we note that three core
    problems arise: the cognitive, normative and composition problems. Combining valuation
    methods, such as contingent valuation and multicriteria analysis, with participatory
    and deliberative techniques is increasingly promoted as a means to address those
    fundamental problems. However, the quality and legitimacy of the valuation process
    then becomes dependent on how participation is framed. We note that numerous issues
    need to be taken into account, such as the roles assumed by participants, the
    differences in contribution among participants, the level of participatory impact
    and the level of democratization of the decision-making process. This paper proposes
    a detailed qualitative analysis of four case studies, each of them having implemented
    a specific valuation method in a participatory process. We analyze how those cases
    were handled in each of the dimensions considered and offer our conclusions about
    the added values and remaining challenges related to participatory environmental
    valuation.'

  abstract: 'Crowd-mapping is a form of collaborative work that empowers citizens
    to collect and share geographic knowledge. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a successful
    example of such paradigm, where the goal of building and maintaining an accurate
    global map of the changing world is being accomplished by means of local contributions
    made by over 1.2M citizens. While OSM has been subject to many country-specific
    studies, the relationship between national culture and economic affluence and
    users'' participation has been so far unexplored. In this work, we systematically
    study the link between them: we characterise OSM users in terms of who they are,
    how they contribute, during what period of time, and across what geographic areas.
    We find strong correlations between these characteristics and national culture
    factors (e.g., power distance, individualism, pace of life, self expression),
    and well as Gross Domestic Product per capita. Based on these findings, we discuss
    design issues that developers of crowd-mapping services should consider to account
    for cross-cultural differences.'

  abstract: The explosive growth in data, computational power, and social media creates
    new opportunities for innovating the processes and solutions of Information and
    communications technology (ICT) based policy-making and research. To take advantage
    of these developments in the digital world, new approaches, concepts, instruments
    and methods are needed to navigate the societal and computational complexity.
    This requires extensive interdisciplinary knowledge of public administration,
    policy analyses, information systems, complex systems and computer science. This
    book provides the foundation for this new interdisciplinary field, in which various
    traditional disciplines are blending. Both policy makers, executors and those
    in charge of policy implementations acknowledge that ICT is becoming more important
    and is changing the policy-making process, resulting in a next generation policy-making
    based on ICT support. Web 2.0 and even Web 3.0 point to the specific applications
    of social networks, semantically enriched and linked data, whereas policy-making
    has also to do with the use of the vast amount of data, predictions and forecasts,
    and improving the outcomes of policy-making, which is confronted with an increasing
    complexity and uncertainty of the outcomes. The field of policy-making is changing
    and driven by developments like open data, computational methods for processing
    data, opining mining, simulation and visualization of rich data sets, all combined
    with public engagement, social media and participatory tools.

    Scott considers how digital technologies are increasingly built into the logic
    and organization of urban spaces and argues that while each city articulates ideals
    such as those of open democracy, civic engagement, efficient governance, and enhanced
    security, competing capitalist interests attached to many of these digital technological
    programs make the “digital city” problematic.'

  abstract: Smart Urbanism (SU) – the rebuilding of cities through the integration
    of digital technologies with buildings, neighbourhoods, networked infrastructures
    and people – is being represented as a unique emerging ‘solution’ to the majority
    of problems faced by cities today. SU discourses, enacted by technology companies,
    national governments and supranational agencies alike, claim a supremacy of urban
    digital technologies for managing and controlling infrastructures, achieving greater
    effectiveness in managing service demand and reducing carbon emissions, developing
    greater social interaction and community networks, providing new services around
    health and social care etc. Smart urbanism is being represented as the response
    to almost every facet of the contemporary urban question.

  abstract: |-
    The Philippines has a long history of state–society engagement to introduce reforms in government and politics. Forces from civil society and social movements have interfaced with reform-oriented leaders in government on a range of social accountability initiatives – to make governance more responsive, to introduce policy reforms, and to make government more accountable.

    Several theoretical propositions on which strategic approaches work best for social accountability initiatives have been put forward – including the idea of vertically integrated civil society monitoring and advocacy. This multi-authored research report uses vertical integration as a framework for examining seven successful civil society social accountability initiatives in the Philippines, looking at what made them successful, and how the gains they realised can be deepened and sustained.

  abstract: Cass Sunstein is the leading advocate of "nudges" – small policy interventions
    that yield major impacts because of behavioral quirks in the way that people process
    information. Such interventions form the core of Sunstein’s philosophy of "libertarian
    paternalism," which seeks to improve on individuals’ decisions while preserving
    their freedom to choose. In "Why Nudge?", Sunstein forcefully defends libertarian
    paternalism against John Stuart Mill’s famous Harm Principle, which holds that
    government should only coerce a person when it is acting to prevent harm to others.
    Sunstein urges that unlike more coercive measures, nudges respect subjects’ goals,
    even as they reshape their choices. Using an analogy to voting paradoxes, this
    review shows that reconciling multiple, inconsistent goals is a fundamentally
    challenging problem; the challenge leaves even deliberative individuals vulnerable
    to manipulation through nudges. The fact of inconsistent goals means that government
    regulators who deploy nudges select and impose their own objectives, instead of
    merely advancing the goals of the regulated. The analogy also highlights that
    multimember legislative bodies are subject to many of the same quirks as individuals,
    raising questions about the government’s ability to improve on individuals’ choices.

  abstract: |-
    Accountability – the obligation of those in power to take responsibility for their actions – involves different types of relationship between different actors in state and society.

    Many factors influence accountability. These are often more complex than one might at first think, especially for new actors in the governance field hoping to leverage the potential of ICT for development.

    In one of three background papers prepared for the Making All Voices Count ‘Transforming Governance' learning event, held in Manila in February 2016, Brendan Halloran reviews how accountability relationships work in reality and considers the extent to which ICTs can influence these processes.

    Using as examples two web-based platforms that were designed to increase accountability – but which ultimately failed to meet expectations – Halloran concludes that:
    - influencing government decision-makers is hard, and there is not an ICT short cut to achieving this
    - where decision-makers are already willing to listen, however, ICT‐enabled citizen voice can increase their ability to do so.

  abstract: The growing participation in social networking sites is altering the nature
    of social relations and changing the nature of political and public dialogue.
    This paper contributes to the current debate on Web 2.0 technologies and their
    implications for local governance, identifying the perceptions of policy makers
    on the use of Web 2.0 in providing public services and on the changing roles that
    could arise from the resulting interaction between local governments and their
    stakeholders. The results obtained suggest that policy makers are willing to implement
    Web 2.0 technologies in providing public services, but preferably under the Bureaucratic
    model framework, thus retaining a leading role in this implementation. The learning
    curve of local governments in the use of Web 2.0 technologies is a factor that
    could influence policy makers’ perceptions. In this respect, many research gaps
    are identified and further study of the question is recommended.

  abstract: |-
    This report looks at the processes through which organisations in South Africa and Kenya choose technology tools to use in transparency and accountability initiatives - and how this influences the effectiveness of their work.

    The research provides lessons for other organisations and practitioners working in technology for transparency and accountability initiatives.

    It also helps organisations to select appropriate digital tools, and to provide an overview of successes and failures that boil down to some basic lessons we all can learn from.

    Six basic rules of thumb for organisations deploying ICT for development stand out:

    Map out what you need to know: At the very least include research on the issue you want to tool to address, the needs to the people you hope will use it and the digital tool options already available.
    Think twice before you build: Look for existing tools that can do the job; building new technologies from scratch is complex and risky.
    Get a second opinion: Someone else has probably tried a similar approach before you.
    Always take it for a test drive: Trial the tool; it highlights problems and raises key questions early on
    Plan for failure: Don’t expect to get it right first time; budget time and money to make adjustments.
    Stop and reflect on what you’re doing: Keep thinking about what is working, and what isn’t.

  abstract: Government “of the people, by the people, for the people” expresses an
    ideal that resonates in all democracies. Yet poll after poll reveals deep distrust
    of institutions that seem to have left “the people” out of the governing equation.
    Government bureaucracies that are supposed to solve critical problems on their
    own are a troublesome outgrowth of the professionalization of public life in the
    industrial age. They are especially ill-suited to confronting today’s complex
    challenges. Offering a far-reaching program for innovation, Smart Citizens, Smarter
    State suggests that public decisionmaking could be more effective and legitimate
    if government were smarter—if our institutions knew how to use technology to leverage
    citizens’ expertise. Just as individuals use only part of their brainpower to
    solve most problems, governing institutions make far too little use of the skills
    and experience of those inside and outside of government with scientific credentials,
    practical skills, and ground-level street smarts. New tools—what Beth Simone Noveck
    calls technologies of expertise—are making it possible to match the supply of
    citizen expertise to the demand for it in government. Drawing on a wide range
    of academic disciplines and practical examples from her work as an adviser to
    governments on institutional innovation, Noveck explores how to create more open
    and collaborative institutions. In so doing, she puts forward a profound new vision
    for participatory democracy rooted not in the paltry act of occasional voting
    or the serendipity of crowdsourcing but in people’s knowledge and know-how.

  abstract: The need for a fresh approach to U.S. communities is more urgent than
    ever because of the biggest global economic crisis since the Great Depression.
    Through examination of the barriers to solving urban problems (and the ways they
    reinforce each other), this paper offers a new approach to community transformation
    which calls for leaders to use technology to inform and connect people. We need
    to convert the social safety net into a social safety network through the creation
    of smarter communities that are information-rich, interconnected, and able to
    provide opportunities to all citizens. This process has already begun through
    such programs as Harlem Children's Zone, Baltimore's CitiStat, Elevate Miami,
    and others. And they can be replicated. But technology alone is not the answer.
    Realization of the vision requires leaders to invest in the tools, guide their
    use, and pave the way for transformation. Perhaps the urgency of the current economic
    crisis can provide the impetus to overcome resistance to change and turn problems
    into an opportunity to reduce costs, improve services to communities, and make
    our cities smarter.

  abstract: A growing number of government agencies, funding organizations, and publishers
    are endorsing the call for increased data sharing, especially in biomedical research,
    many with an ultimate goal of open data. Open data is among the least restrictive
    forms of data sharing, in contrast to managed access mechanisms, which typically
    have terms of use and in some cases oversight by the data generators themselves.
    But despite an ethically sound rationale and growing support for open data sharing
    in many parts of the world, concerns remain, particularly among researchers in
    low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa, Latin America, and parts of
    Asia and the Middle East that comprise the Global South. Drawing on our perspective
    as researchers and ethicists working in the Global South, we see opportunities
    to improve community engagement, raise awareness, and build capacity, all toward
    improving research and data sharing involving researchers in LMICs.

  abstract: Rapid advances in our ability to collect, analyze, and disseminate information
    are transforming public administration. This “big data” revolution presents opportunities
    for improving the management of public programs, but it also entails some risks.
    In addition to potentially magnifying well-known problems with public sector performance
    management—particularly the problem of goal displacement—the widespread dissemination
    of administrative data and performance information increasingly enables external
    political actors to peer into and evaluate the administration of public programs.
    The latter trend is consequential because external actors may have little sense
    of the validity of performance metrics and little understanding of the policy
    priorities they capture. The author illustrates these potential problems using
    recent research on U.S. primary and secondary education and suggests that public
    administration scholars could help improve governance in the data-rich future
    by informing the development and dissemination of organizational report cards
    that better capture the value that public agencies deliver.

  abstract: |-
    Legislation is presently under strain. Technical progress, internationalisation and the growth of legal information alter the presuppositions at what seems to be an ever accelerating pace.

    These developments do not merely affect the issues to be regulated. This process also challenges the concept of legislation as such. It is in several ways apparent that traditional means of solving legal problems are becoming less efficient, and that alternative solutions ought to be considered.

    This article focuses on the latter. More precisely, the objective is to discuss whether there exist methods, or ways of approach, which may support law-making in a complicated technical environment characterised by a fast pace of change. The discussion is tentative; the ambition is merely to make an inventory of possible ways ahead.

  abstract: The legal framework on data protection in Europe sets a high standard
    with regard to the possible re-use of personal data. Principles like purpose limitation
    and data minimization challenge the emerging Big Data paradigm, where the "value"
    of data is linked to its somehow still unpredictable potential future uses. Nevertheless,
    the re-use of data is not impossible, once they are properly anonymized. The EU's
    Article 29 Working Party published in 2014 an Opinion on the application of anonymization
    techniques, which can be implemented to enable potential re-use of previously
    collected data within a framework of safeguards for individuals. The paper reviews
    the main elements of the Opinion, with a view to the widespread adoption of anonymization
    policies enabling a fair re-use of data, and gives an overview of the legal and
    technical aspects related to anonymization, pointing out the many misconceptions
    on the issue.

  abstract: |-
    Ons Geld (Our Money) is a Dutch citizen initiative seeking to put the question of money production on the public agenda. Ons Geld pushed for legislation that would ensure commercial banks cannot create new money (virtual money) when providing their clients with credit lines. Furthermore, the initiative asked that when money is created by the state, it should be used in the public interest and not for bailing out commercial banks or real estate companies.

    The Netherlands is often hailed as a leading example of the integration of ICTs within democratic politics, and the organisers of Ons Geld initiative made extensive use of digital technologies - websites, online forums, social networking platforms, electronic newsletters - to build support for their initiative.

    This case exemplifies the grassroots use of digital technologies for citizen engagement purposes in a larger political context in which the idea of 'active citizenship' and digital technologies are hailed as solutions to contemporary problems faced by democratic governments. Furthermore, this initiative is shaped by the type of citizen engagement envisioned in the formal mechanisms for citizen participation made available by state institutions.

  abstract: After decades of urban investment dominated by sprawl and outward growth,
    municipal governments in the United States are responsible for the upkeep of urban
    neighborhoods that have not received sufficient resources or maintenance in many
    years. One of city governments' biggest challenges is to revitalize decaying neighborhoods
    given only limited resources. In this paper, we apply data science techniques
    to administrative data to help the City of Memphis, Tennessee improve distressed
    neighborhoods. We develop new methods to efficiently identify homes in need of
    rehabilitation and to predict the impacts of potential investments on neighborhoods.
    Our analyses allow Memphis to design neighborhood-improvement strategies that
    generate greater impacts on communities. Since our work uses data that most US
    cities already collect, our models and methods are highly portable and inexpensive
    to implement. We also discuss the challenges we encountered while analyzing government
    data and deploying our tools, and highlight important steps to improve future
    data-driven efforts in urban policy.

  abstract: 'Open government initiatives in the U.S. government focus on three main
    aspects: transparency, participation, and collaboration. Especially the collaboration
    mandate is relatively unexplored in the literature. In practice, government organizations
    recognize the need to include external problem solvers into their internal innovation
    creation processes. This is partly derived from a sense of urgency to improve
    the efficiency and quality of government service delivery. Another formal driver
    is the America Competes Act that instructs agencies to search for opportunities
    to meaningfully promote excellence in technology, education, and science. Government
    agencies are responding to these requirements by using open innovation (OI) approaches
    to invite citizens to crowdsource and peer produce solutions to public management
    problems. These distributed innovation processes occur at all levels of the U.S.
    government and it is important to understand what design elements are used to
    create innovative public management ideas. This article systematically reviews
    existing government crowdsourcing and peer production initiatives and shows that
    after agencies have defined their public management problem, they go through four
    different phases of the OI process: (1) idea generation through crowdsourcing,
    (2) incubation of submitted ideas with peer voting and collaborative improvements
    of favorite solutions, (3) validation with a proof of concept of implementation
    possibilities, and (4) reveal of the selected solution and the (internal) implementation
    of the winning idea. Participation and engagement are incentivized both with monetary
    and nonmonetary rewards, which lead to tangible solutions as well as intangible
    innovation outcomes, such as increased public awareness.'

    We humans are swamped with text. It's not just news and other timely information: Regular people are drowning in legal documents. The problem is so bad we mostly ignore it. Every time a person uses a store's loyalty rewards card or connects to an online service, his or her activities are governed by the equivalent of hundreds of pages of legalese. Most people pay no attention to these massive documents, often labeled "terms of service," "user agreement," or "privacy policy."

    As computer science researchers, we are working on ways artificial intelligence algorithms could digest these massive texts and extract their meaning, presenting it in terms regular people can understand.

  abstract: |-
    Kenya’s arid and semi-arid regions have faced recurrent drought, famine, and inter-community conflicts. High levels of need have led to large humanitarian relief programmes involving government and national and international nongovernmental organisations (NGOs). This is the context in which Transparency International Kenya (TI-Kenya)’s Uwajibikaji Pamoja (Accountability Together) programme emerged. Uwajibikaji Pamoja is an integrated complaints referral mechanism run by TI-Kenya in partnership with more than 40 service providers, including government and development aid agencies.

    The mechanism allows citizens to lodge complaints about gaps in access to a range of services provided by the government and humanitarian agencies, through a toll-free SMS line, email and walk-ins, from where the complaint is then referred to the relevant provider. The system then follows up with complainants and provides information on the status of their feedback. It is designed to complement internal feedback mechanisms set up by partners, where these exist, by making submission and receipt of complaints easier, less costly and less time-consuming.

    This paper summarises the process and findings of practitioner research by TI-Kenya, to assess the effectiveness of Uwajibikaji Pamoja and how technology has facilitated the system. These findings - discussed in a conversation between Abrahams Misoi (TI-Kenya) and Francesca Feruglio (IDS) - indicate that the wide range of government and NGO bodies involved in Uwajibikaji Pamoja have made significant changes to their processes for dealing with and responding to complaints as a result of the TI-Kenya report’s recommendations.

    Uruguay is a particular case within Latin American in terms of how strong, stable and traditional its democratic institutions are. The country has also seen recent implementation of policies to promote development by the spread and use of information and communications technologies. An enabling policy framework, an emergent digital culture and accumulated experience in civic engagement also contribute to the implementation of open government action plans in the country.

    This State of Art Report explores how information and communication technologies (ICTs) have enabled civic engagement in Uruguay. The first section provides an overview of the political and civic liberties framework in Uruguay. In the second section the landscape of ICT mediated citizen engagement is mapped through the Open Government Action Plan. In the third section, the report engages with implications of technology mediations for deliberative democracy and transformative citizenship.

    The Open Government Partnership (OGP), a multi-stakeholder governance initiative comprising 74 countries across the world, is one of several recent attempts to harness and actualise emerging insights about the nature of successful governance reform. OGP is focused on helping its member countries deliver transformative changes that matter to citizens, through collaboration and the co-creation of policy commitments by governments and civil society organisations (CSOs).

    This brief reviews the evidence from Learning to Make All Voices Count (L-MAVC), a programme funded by Making All Voices Count, and implemented in collaboration with Global Integrity. L-MAVC intended to support six Making All Voices Count grantees, working in five countries, in co-creating and applying a participatory, learning-centred, and adaptive approach to strengthening citizen engagement in governance processes in their contexts, including with respect to the Open Government Partnership (OGP).

  abstract: "Public sector innovation is an important issue in the agenda of policymakers
    and academics but there is a need for a change of perspective, one that promotes
    a more open model of innovating, which takes advantage of the possibilities offered
    by collaboration between citizens, entrepreneurs and civil society as well as
    of new emerging technologies. Living labs are environments that can support public
    open innovation processes.\n \n This article makes a practical contribution to
    understand the role of living labs as intermediaries of public open innovation.
    The analysis focuses on the dynamics of these innovation intermediaries, their
    outcomes, and their main challenges. In particular, it adopts a qualitative approach
    (fourteen semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted) in order
    to analyze two living labs: Citilab in the city of Cornellà and the network of
    fab athenaeums (public fab labs) in the city of Barcelona, both in Spain. After
    a thorough analysis of the attributes of these living labs, the article concludes
    that 1) living labs provide the opportunity for public agencies to meet with private
    sector organizations and thus function as innovation intermediaries, 2) implementing
    an open innovation perspective is considered more important than obtaining specific
    innovation results, and 3) scalability and sustainability are the main problems
    living labs encounter as open innovation intermediaries."

  abstract: 'Social media is an invaluable source of time-critical information during
    a crisis. However, emergency response and humanitarian relief organizations that
    would like to use this information struggle with an avalanche of social media
    messages that exceeds human capacity to process. Emergency managers, decision
    makers, and affected communities can make sense of social media through a combination
    of machine computation and human compassion - expressed by thousands of digital
    volunteers who publish, process, and summarize potentially life-saving information.
    This book brings together computational methods from many disciplines: natural
    language processing, semantic technologies, data mining, machine learning, network
    analysis, human-computer interaction, and information visualization, focusing
    on methods that are commonly used for processing social media messages under time-critical
    constraints, and offering more than 500 references to in-depth information.'

  abstract: Big Data Science, which combines large data sets with techniques from
    statistics and machine learning, is beginning to reach the social sciences. The
    promise of this approach to investigation are considerable, allowing researchers
    to establish correlations between variables over huge numbers of participants
    using data that has been gathered in a non-invasive fashion and in natural settings.
    Unlike large-data projects in the physical sciences, however, use of these data
    sets in the social sciences require that the subjects generating the data be treated
    in a fair an ethical fashion. This is often taken as requiring either compliance
    with the common rule, or that the data be de-identified to insure the privacy
    of the subjects. But de-identification turns out to be far more difficult than
    one might think. In particular, the ability to re-identify subjects from a set
    of attributes that can be linked to other data sets has led to a number of mechanisms,
    such as k-anonymity or l-diversity, that attempt to define technical solutions
    to the deidentification problem. But these mechanisms are not without their cost.
    Recent work has shown that de-identification of a data set can introduce statistical
    bias into that data, making the results extracted by analysis of the de-identified
    set vary significantly from those same analyses applied to the original set. In
    this paper, we will look at how this bias is introduced when a particular form
    of de-identification, kanonymity, is applied to a particular large data set generated
    by the Massive Open On-line Courses (MOOCs) offered by Harvard and MIT. We will
    discuss some of the tensions that arise between privacy and Big Data science as
    a result of this bias, and look at some of the ways that have been proposed to
    avoid the trade-off between accurate science and privacy. Finally, we will outline
    a promising new approach to de-identification which appears to avoid much of the
    bias introduction, at least on the data set in question.

  abstract: In recent years the necessity for governments to develop new public values
    of openness and transparency, and thereby increase their citizenries' sense of
    inclusiveness, and their trust in and confidence about their governments, has
    risen to the point of urgency. The decline of trust in governments, especially
    in developing countries, has been unprecedented and continuous. A new paradigm
    that signifies a shift to citizen-driven initiatives over and above state- and
    market-centric ones calls for innovative thinking that requires openness in government.
    The need for this new synergy notwithstanding, Open Government cannot be considered
    truly open unless it also enhances citizen participation and engagement. The Ghana
    Open Data Initiative (GODI) project strives to create an open data community that
    will enable government (supply side) and civil society in general (demand side)
    to exchange data and information. We argue that the GODI is too narrowly focused
    on the supply side of the project, and suggest that it should generate an even
    platform to improve interaction between government and citizens to ensure a balance
    in knowledge sharing with and among all constituencies.

  abstract: 'Much has been said about the appeal of digital government devices to
    enhance consultation on rulemaking. This paper explores the most ambitious attempt
    by the UK central government so far to draw on “crowdsourcing” to consult and
    act on regulatory reform, the “Red Tape Challenge.” We find that the results of
    this exercise do not represent any major change to traditional challenges to consultation
    processes. Instead, we suggest that the extensive institutional arrangements for
    crowdsourcing were hardly significant in informing actual policy responses: neither
    the tone of the crowdsourced comments, the direction of the majority views, nor
    specific comments were seen to matter. Instead, it was processes within the executive
    that shaped the overall governmental responses to this initiative. The findings,
    therefore, provoke wider debates about the use of social media in rulemaking and
    consultation exercises.'

  abstract: Crisis mapping has emerged as a method of connecting and empowering citizens
    during emergencies. This article explores the hyperbole behind crisis mapping
    as it extends into more long-term or ‘chronic’ community development practices.
    We critically examined developer issues and participant (i.e. community organization)
    usage within the context of local communities. We repurposed the predominant crisis
    mapping platform Crowdmap for three cases of community development in Canadian
    anglophone and francophone. Our case studies show mixed results about the actual
    cost of deployment, the results of disintermediation, and local context with the
    mapping application. Lastly, we discuss the relationship of hype, temporality,
    and community development as expressed in our cases.

  abstract: "Under the UK government’s open government data (OGD)\ninitiative, departments
    have been encouraged to make nonpersonal government held datasets available online
    under\nopen licenses and in standard formats, enabling the re-use\nof data to
    support transparency and accountability,\nimproved public services and innovation
    and economic\ngrowth. This policy covers a wide range of government\ndatasets,
    from core reference data and regularly collected\nperformance indicators, to one-off
    research commissioned\nto support policy making. In arguments for open data,\ngovernment
    datasets are commonly treated as if they are\npre-existing artifacts waiting to
    be transferred from their\ncurrent locations locked away on government hard drives,\nto
    public availability on websites and data-portals.\nHowever, in practice, many
    datasets are constructed in the\nprocess of being opened: whether as combinations
    of source\nmaterial, or as derivative extracts of internal data systems.\nIn this
    short paper we present a brief case study of one\ninstance of open data release,
    focusing on a dataset related\nto the ‘Digital Landscape Research’ published in
    2012\nalongside a new Government Digital Strategy. We explore\ndifferent factors
    influencing how the data came to be\npublished, and question whether a simple
    call for ‘raw data’\nbest serves the cause of promoting data re-use. "

  abstract: In an increasingly connected and networked world, the National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration (NASA) recognizes the value of the public as a strategic
    partner in addressing some of our most pressing challenges. The agency is working
    to more effectively harness the expertise, ingenuity, and creativity of individual
    members of the public by enabling, accelerating, and scaling the use of open innovation
    approaches including prizes, challenges, and crowdsourcing. As NASA's use of open
    innovation tools to solve a variety of types of problems and advance of number
    of outcomes continues to grow, challenge design is also becoming more sophisticated
    as our expertise and capacity (personnel, platforms, and partners) grows and develops.
    NASA has recently pivoted from talking about the benefits of challenge-driven
    approaches, to the outcomes these types of activities yield. Challenge design
    should be informed by desired outcomes that align with NASA's mission. This paper
    provides several case studies of NASA open innovation activities and maps the
    outcomes of those activities to a successful set of outcomes that challenges can
    help drive alongside traditional tools such as contracts, grants and partnerships.

  abstract: Social media has provided governments with new means to improve efficiency
    and innovation, by engaging a crowd in the gathering and development of data.
    These collaborative processes are also described as a way to improve democracy
    by enabling a more transparent and deliberative democracy where citizens participate
    more directly in decision processes on different levels. However, the dominant
    research on the e-democratic field takes a government perspective rather then
    a citizen perspective. Edemocracy from the perspective of the individual actor,
    in a global context, is less developed. In this paper I therefore develop a model
    for a democratic process outside the realm of the nation state, in a performative
    state where inequality is norm and the state is unclear and fluid. In this process
    eparticipation means an ICT supported method to get a diversity of opinions and
    perspectives rather than one single. This micro perspective on democratic participation
    online might be useful for development of tools for more democratic online crowds.

    Few perceptions are more palpable than that of trust or its absence. Governments

    makers need it most, given persistent unemployment, rising inequality and a variety
    of global pressures. This report examines the influence of trust on policy making

  abstract: Government contracting has experienced an explosion of available data
    in the last decade, marked by the rise of the global Open Contracting Data Standard.
    However, it remains largely under-utilized for Big Data analytics and embedding
    findings in policy making. In order to address this gap and promote the use of
    government administrative data for policy making, this paper provides a review
    on the availability, scope and quality of datasets in government contracting in
    35 European countries and highlights prominent use cases to inspire policy makers
    and civil society. State of the art findings come from the ongoing Horizon2020-funded
    research project led by the University of Cambridge, called DIGIWHIST, which benchmarks,
    standardizes, and republishes public procurement data across Europe while also
    providing key performance indicators directly relevant for policy. Use cases demonstrate
    how civil society can use Big Data to hold governments accountable; and how governments
    can use advanced market analytics for detecting collusive competitors and safeguarding
    public spending.

  abstract: "A statement or action can be said to be manipulative if it does not sufficiently
    engage or appeal to people’s capacity for reflective and deliberative choice.
    One problem with manipulation, thus understood, is that it fails to respect people’s
    autonomy and is an affront to their dignity. Another problem is that if they are
    products of manipulation, people’s choices might fail to promote their own welfare,
    and might instead promote the welfare of the manipulator. To that extent, the
    central objection to manipulation is rooted in a version of Mill’s Harm Principle:
    People know what is in their best interests and should have a (manipulation-free)
    opportunity to make that decision. On welfarist grounds, the norm against manipulation
    can be seen as a kind of heuristic, one that generally works well, but that can
    also lead to serious errors, at least when the manipulator is both informed and
    genuinely interested in the welfare of the chooser. \n\nFor the legal system,
    a pervasive puzzle is why manipulation is rarely policed. The simplest answer
    is that manipulation has so many shades, and in a social order that values free
    markets and is committed to freedom of expression, it is exceptionally difficult
    to regulate manipulation as such. But as the manipulator’s motives become more
    self-interested or venal, and as efforts to bypass people’s deliberative capacities
    becomes more successful, the ethical objections to manipulation become very forceful,
    and the argument for a legal response is fortified. The analysis of manipulation
    bears on emerging first amendment issues raised by compelled speech, especially
    in the context of graphic health warnings. Importantly, it can also help orient
    the regulation of financial products, where manipulation of consumer choices is
    an evident but rarely explicit concern."

  abstract: Open data is being increasingly looked at as a major driver of public
    service innovation. Open access to datasets and advanced analytical tools are
    believed to generate valuable new knowledge that can be turned into data-driven
    services. At the same time, open data is also believed to spur open governance
    and enable the engagement of various stakeholders in the co-creation of services.
    Despite this appealing vision of open data-driven co-creation of public services,
    we are far from understanding how it can be realize in practice. We turned to
    63 experts and practitioners in a survey covering six European countries and found
    a multitude of barriers that need to be overcome first. Luckily we also found
    some drivers. This paper provides some first insights into these drivers and barriers
    and proposes policy recommendations to foster a data-driven transformation of
    public service creation.

  abstract: Citizen sensing, or the use of low-cost and accessible digital technologies
    to monitor environments, has contributed to new types of environmental data and
    data practices. Through a discussion of participatory research into air pollution
    sensing with residents of northeastern Pennsylvania concerned about the effects
    of hydraulic fracturing, we examine how new technologies for generating environmental
    data also give rise to new problems for analysing and making sense of citizen-gathered
    data. After first outlining the citizen data practices we collaboratively developed
    with residents for monitoring air quality, we then describe the data stories that
    we created along with citizens as a method and technique for composing data. We
    further mobilise the concept of ‘just good enough data’ to discuss the ways in
    which citizen data gives rise to alternative ways of creating, valuing and interpreting
    datasets. We specifically consider how environmental data raises different concerns
    and possibilities in relation to Big Data, which can be distinct from security
    or social media studies. We then suggest ways in which citizen datasets could
    generate different practices and interpretive insights that go beyond the usual
    uses of environmental data for regulation, compliance and modelling to generate
    expanded data citizenships.

  abstract: This book offers a detailed exploration of three examples of humanitarian
    uses of new technology, employing key theoretical insights from Foucault. We are
    currently seeing a humanitarian turn to new digital technologies, such as biometrics,
    remote sensing, and surveillance drones. However, such humanitarian uses of new
    technology have not always produced beneficial results for those at the receiving
    end and have sometimes exposed the subjects of assistance to additional risks
    and insecurities. Engaging with key insights from the work of Foucault combined
    with selected concepts from the Science and Technology Studies literature, this
    book produces an analytical framework that opens up the analysis to details of
    power and control at the level of materiality that are often ignored in liberal
    histories of war and modernity. Whereas Foucault details the design of prisons,
    factories, schools, etc., this book is original in its use of his work, in that
    it uses these key insights about the details of power embedded in material design,
    but shifts the attention to the technologies and attending forms of power that
    have been experimented with in the three humanitarian endeavours presented in

  abstract: |-
    Holding power to account requires understanding where power lies and how it is exercised. It entails understanding how decisions are made and who makes them, and the nature of entrenched, institutional obstacles to change.

    With technology for development - and in particular the idea of open data - holding so much potential for better governance, how can we make sure that these new ideas are building on what we already know about how to really hold power to account?

    In one of three background papers prepared for the Making All Voices Count ‘Transforming Governance’ learning event, held in Manila, in February 2016, Joy Aceron and Francis Isaac discuss ‘vertical integration’, an idea which can be used to help civil society actors monitor and analyse public sector actions.

    In this paper, they draw on two examples of civil society campaigns from the Philippines:
    - Textbook Count, which monitored the entire process of the government’s textbook delivery programme from procurement to distribution
    - The campaign for the Reproductive Health Bill, which mobilised more than 300 organisations into action at different levels of the policy process to influence change.

  abstract: Open data has been recognized as a valuable resource, and public institutions
    have taken to publishing their data under open licenses, also in Germany. However,
    German public transit agencies are still reluctant to publish their schedules
    as open data. Also, two widely used data exchange formats used in German transit
    planning are proprietary, with no documentation publicly available. Through this
    work, one of the proprietary formats was reverse-engineered, and a transformation
    process into the open GTFS schedule format was developed. This process allowed
    a partnering transit operator to publish their schedule as open data. Also, through
    a survey taken with German transit authorities and operators, the prevalence of
    transit data exchange formats, and reservations concerning open transit data were
    evaluated. The survey brought a series of issues to light which serve as obstacles
    for opening up transit data. Addressing the issues found through this work, and
    partnering with open-minded transit authorities to further develop transit data
    publishing processes can serve as a foundation for wider adoption of publishing
    open transit data in Germany.

  abstract: 'Digital storytelling has become a popular method for curating community,
    organizational, and individual narratives. Since its beginnings over 20 years
    ago, projects have sprung up across the globe, where authentic voice is found
    in the narration of lived experiences. Contributing to a Collective Intelligence
    for the Common Good, the authors of this paper ask how shared stories can bring
    impetus to community groups to help identify what they seek to change, and how
    digital storytelling can be effectively implemented in community partnership projects
    to enable authentic voices to be carried out by stakeholders in society. The Community
    Digital Storytelling (CDST) method is introduced as a means for addressing community-of-place
    issues. There are five stages to this method: preparation, storytelling, story
    digitization, digital story sense-making, and digital story sharing. Additionally,
    a Storytelling Cycle of Trust framework is proposed. We identify four trust dimensions
    as being imperative foundations in implementing community digital media interventions
    for the common good: legitimacy, authenticity, synergy, and commons. This framework
    is concerned with increasing the impact that everyday stories can have on society;
    it is an engine driving prolonged storytelling. From this perspective, we consider
    the ability to scale up the scope and benefit of stories in civic contexts. '

  abstract: Open data initiatives are characterized, in several countries, by a great
    extension of the number of data sets made available for access by public administrations,
    constituencies, businesses and other actors, such as journalists, international
    institutions and academics, to mention a few. However, most of the open data sets
    rely on selection criteria, based on a technology-driven perspective, rather than
    a focus on the potential public and social value of data to be published. Several
    experiences and reports confirm this issue, such as those of the Open Data Census.
    However, there are also relevant best practices. The goal of this paper is to
    investigate the different dimensions of a framework suitable to support public
    administrations, as well as constituencies, in assessing and benchmarking the
    social value of open data initiatives. The framework is tested on three initiatives,
    referring to three different countries, Italy, the United Kingdom and Tunisia.
    The countries have been selected to provide a focus on European and Mediterranean
    countries, considering also the difference in legal frameworks (civic law vs.
    common law countries).

  abstract: Does online voting mobilize citizens who otherwise would not participate?
    During the annual participatory budgeting vote in the southern state of Rio Grande
    do Sul in Brazil -- the world's largest -- Internet voters were asked whether
    they would have participated had there not been an online voting option (i-voting).
    The study documents an 8.2 percent increase in total turn-out with the introduction
    of i-voting. In support of the mobilization hypothesis, unique survey data show
    that i-voting is mainly used by new participants rather than just for convenience
    by those who were already mobilized. The study also finds that age, gender, income,
    education, and social media usage are significant predictors of being online-only
    voters. Technology appears more likely to engage people who are younger, male,
    of higher income and educational attainment, and more frequent social media users.

  abstract: |-
    The Small World Initiative™ (SWI) is an innovative program that encourages students to pursue careers in science and sets forth a unique platform to crowdsource new antibiotics. It centers around an introductory biology course through which students perform original hands-on field and laboratory research in the hunt for new antibiotics. Through a series of student-driven experiments, students collect soil samples, isolate diverse bacteria, test their bacteria against clinically-relevant microorganisms, and characterize those showing inhibitory activity. This is particularly relevant since over two thirds of antibiotics originate from soil bacteria or fungi. SWI’s approach also provides a platform to crowdsource antibiotic discovery by tapping into the intellectual power of many people concurrently addressing a global challenge and advances promising candidates into the drug development pipeline. This unique class approach harnesses the power of active learning to achieve both educational and scientific goals.

    Formulated in 2012 at Yale University by Jo Handelsman, the current Associate Director of Science at the White House, the course is now in 109 institutions in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and nine countries. We will present course data on enrollment and curriculum integration as well as highlight implementation at National University. We will discuss our preliminary student evaluation results, which show the compelling impact of the program in comparison to traditional introductory courses. Ultimately, the mission of the program is to provide an evidence-based approach to teaching introductory biology concepts in the context of a real-world problem. This approach has been shown to be particularly impactful on underrepresented STEM talent pools, including women and minorities.

    our culture and society? Pierre Lévy shows how the unfettered exchange of ideas
    in cyberspace has the potential to liberate us from the social and political hierarchies
    that have stood in the way of mankind's advancement. Anthropologist, historian,
    sociologist, and philosopher, Lévy writes with a depth of scholarship and imaginative
    insight rare among media critics. At once a profound historical analysis of the
    development of human culture and a blueprint for the future, Collective Intelligence
    is a visionary work.

  abstract: |-
    Much of the literature on citizen accountability focuses on citizen voices. This research briefing is one of four which turn the spotlight on the how the state behaves in instances of accountable governance. Each examines a landmark social justice policy process in Africa, asking when and how the state listened, and to which actors; and why, at times, it chose not to listen.

    The creation of Ghana’s National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2004 was a major health policy reform. It was shaped by both internal and external factors. Domestically, the NHIS was born of a moment of political transformation in the relationship between state and citizens. The government responded to the realities and demands of a newly-established democracy, and a media campaign that highlighted the ill effects of existing healthcare structures. Externally, access to debt relief and the adoption of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper influenced the government’s decision to enact a health insurance policy.

  abstract: All countries are investing in health data. There are however significant
    cross-country differences in data availability and use. Some countries stand out
    for their innovative practices enabling privacy-protective data use while others
    are falling behind with insufficient data and restrictions that limit access to
    and use of data, even by government itself. Countries that develop a data governance
    framework that enables privacy-protective data use will not only have the information
    needed to promote quality, efficiency and performance in their health systems,
    they will become a more attractive centre for medical research. After examining
    the current situation in OECD countries, a multi-disciplinary advisory panel of
    experts identified eight key data governance mechanisms to maximise benefits to
    patients and to societies from the collection, linkage and analysis of health
    data and to, at the same time, minimise risks to the privacy of patients and to
    the security of health data. These mechanisms include coordinated development
    of high-value, privacy-protective health information systems, legislation that
    permits privacy-protective data use, open and transparent public communication,
    accreditation or certification of health data processors, transparent and fair
    project approval processes, data de-identification and data security practices
    that meet legal requirements and public expectations without compromising data
    utility and a process to continually assess and renew the data governance framework
    as new data and new risks emerge.

  abstract: Most of society's innovation systems – academic science, the patent system,
    open source, etc. – are “open” in the sense that they are designed to facilitate
    knowledge disclosure among innovators. An essential difference across innovation
    systems is whether disclosure is of intermediate progress and solutions or of
    completed innovations. We theorize and present experimental evidence linking intermediate
    versus final disclosure to an ‘incentives-versus-reuse’ tradeoff and to a transformation
    of the innovation search process. We find intermediate disclosure has the advantage
    of efficiently steering development towards improving existing solution approaches,
    but also has the effect of limiting experimentation and narrowing technological
    search. We discuss the comparative advantages of intermediate versus final disclosure
    policies in fostering innovation.

    This report seeks to shed light on these questions by investigating a broad variety of citizen-generated data projects. It starts with two assumptions:
    1) citizen-generated data is created through different project setups, or chains of data exchanges. These setups may involve cross-sector collaborations–including individual citizens, civil society organisations, funders, public institutions, policy makers and private companies;
    2) project setups operate in different contexts that
    shape the incentives to produce and use citizen-generated data.

  abstract: This paper presents a benchmark proposal for the Open Government and its
    application from the open data perspective using data available on the U.S. government's
    open data portal (data.gov). The benchmark is developed over the adopted Open
    Government conceptual model, which describes Open Government through data openness,
    transparency, participation and collaboration. Resulting in two measures, that
    is, one known as the e-government openness index (eGovOI) and the other Maturity,
    the benchmark indicates the progress of government over time, the efficiency of
    recognizing and implementing new concepts and the willingness of the government
    to recognize and embrace innovative ideas.

  abstract: The article argues, drawing on interviews, event observations, academic
    and policy literature, that the UK’s Open Government Data (OGD) initiative should
    be understood as part of a deep seated social and political struggle with significant
    processes of co-optation and contestation over outcomes underway. The OGD initiative’s
    intersections with both the PSI re-use industry and the UK government’s programme
    of forced ‘austerity’ and marketisation of public services are problematised.
    Civil society advocates’ vulnerabilities within this context are discussed and
    a number of recommendations are offered for the progressive shaping of OGD based
    on egalitarian principles.

  abstract: There has been an encouraging level of momentum and interest among policymakers
    and researchers behind the need for more rigorous and credible evidence to inform
    public policy decisions. The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at
    MIT has made significant progress in meeting this demand by spurring new research,
    translating and synthesizing existing bodies of research, empowering policymakers
    to generate and consume evidence, convening researchers and decision makers, and
    creating public goods that encourage best practices in rigorous, transparent research.
    Chief among these best practices are the use of randomized evaluation to rigorously
    test what works for the poor and the use of administrative data to make such scientific,
    low-cost research possible. By bringing together academics, policymakers, and
    practitioners in the field around this set of best practices, we can generate
    rigorous evidence, gain important policy insights, and translate those lessons
    into concrete policy action.

  abstract: This paper explores the governance by algorithms in information societies.
    Theoretically, it builds on (co-)evolutionary innovation studies in order to adequately
    grasp the interplay of technological and societal change, and combines these with
    institutional approaches to incorporate governance by technology or rather software
    as institutions. Methodologically it draws from an empirical survey of Internet-based
    services that rely on automated algorithmic selection, a functional typology derived
    from it, and an analysis of associated potential social risks. It shows how algorithmic
    selection has become a growing source of social order, of a shared social reality
    in information societies. It argues that – similar to the construction of realities
    by traditional mass media – automated algorithmic selection applications shape
    daily lives and realities, affect the perception of the world, and influence behavior.
    However, the co-evolutionary perspective on algorithms as institutions, ideologies,
    intermediaries and actors highlights differences that are to be found first in
    the growing personalization of constructed realities, and second in the constellation
    of involved actors. Altogether, compared to reality construction by traditional
    mass media, algorithmic reality construction tends to increase individualization,
    commercialization, inequalities and deterritorialization, and to decrease transparency,
    controllability and predictability.

  abstract: "Laws and regulations are ubiquitous, touching on many aspects of individual
    and corporate behavior. But under what conditions are laws and rules actually
    effective? A huge amount of recent work in political science, sociology, economics,
    criminology, law, and psychology, among other disciplines, deals with this question.
    But these fields rarely inform one another, leaving the state of research disjointed
    and disorganized. Lawrence M. Friedman finds order in this cacophony. Impact gathers
    recent findings into one overarching analysis and lays the groundwork for a cohesive
    body of work in what Friedman labels “impact studies.”\n \n The first important
    factor that has a bearing on impact is communication. A rule or law has no effect
    if it never reaches its intended audience. The public’s fund of legal knowledge,
    the clarity of the law, and the presence of information brokers all influence
    the flow of information from lawmakers to citizens. After a law is communicated,
    subjects sometimes comply, sometimes resist, and sometimes adjust or evade. Three
    clusters of motives help shape which reaction will prevail: first, rewards and
    punishments; second, peer group influences; and third, issues of conscience, legitimacy,
    and morality. When all of these factors move in the same direction, law can have
    a powerful impact; when they conflict, the outcome is sometimes unpredictable."

  abstract: Big data is ubiquitous but heterogeneous. Big data can be used to tally
    clicks and traffic on web pages, find patterns in stock trades, track consumer
    preferences, identify linguistic correlations in large corpuses of texts. This
    book examines big data not as an undifferentiated whole but contextually, investigating
    the varied challenges posed by big data for health, science, law, commerce, and
    politics. Taken together, the chapters reveal a complex set of problems, practices,
    and policies. The advent of big data methodologies has challenged the theory-driven
    approach to scientific knowledge in favor of a data-driven one. Social media platforms
    and self-tracking tools change the way we see ourselves and others. The collection
    of data by corporations and government threatens privacy while promoting transparency.
    Meanwhile, politicians, policy makers, and ethicists are ill-prepared to deal
    with big data’s ramifications. The contributors look at big data’s effect on individuals
    as it exerts social control through monitoring, mining, and manipulation; big
    data and society, examining both its empowering and its constraining effects;
    big data and science, considering issues of data governance, provenance, reuse,
    and trust; and big data and organizations, discussing data responsibility, “data
    harm,” and decision making.

  abstract: This paper introduces Google Votes, an experiment in liquid democracy
    built on Google's internal corporate Google+ social network. Liquid democracy
    decision-making systems can scale to cover large groups by enabling voters to
    delegate their votes to other voters. This approach is in contrast to direct democracy
    systems where voters vote directly on issues, and representative democracy systems
    where voters elect representatives to vote on issues for them. Liquid democracy
    systems can provide many of the benefits of both direct and representative democracy
    systems with few of the weaknesses. Thus far, high implementation complexity and
    infrastructure costs have prevented widespread adoption. Google Votes demonstrates
    how the use of social-networking technology can overcome these barriers and enable
    practical liquid democracy systems. The case-study of Google Votes usage at Google
    over a 3 year timeframe is included, as well as a framework for evaluating vote
    visibility called the "Golden Rule of Liquid Democracy".

  abstract: First, this book pays attention to the overall impact of the Internet
    and people's use of digital media and new technologies to analyze civic life at
    large, reconceptualizing what citizenship is today. Secondly, and more specifically,
    participants shed light over the intersection of a number of current new agendas
    of research in regards to some of the most rapidly growing technological advances
    (i.e., new publics and citizenship), and the emergence of sprouting structures
    of citizenship. The volume shows the implications that new technological advances
    carry with respect the possibilities, patterns and mechanisms for citizen communication,
    citizen deliberation, public sphere and civic engagement.

It also has an e-consultation space where government departments can solicit public opinion for aiding policy development. UDC has Web TV and Internet radio channels, and linkages to social networking and social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google plus, Youtube and Instagram.

    This case study on UDC attempts to address the following questions:
    - what visions of citizen engagement inform UDC?
    - what norms of citizen engagement are legitimated through UDC?
    - has UDC contributed to a cooperative and democratic dialog between state, agencies and citizens?

    The authors analyse interviews with key stakeholders from the government, academia and civil society organisations working on human rights and development, and health on the above mentioned questions. The interviews were assessed in the historical context of Colombian democracy, that has been marked by a continued co-existence of electoral politics with violent in-fighting between groups, representing the traditional elites in power, popular movements excluded from the political arena, and criminal organisations funded by narco-trafficking.

  abstract: "The social and economic shifts of the past few decades have hardened
    the deeply held scepticism and distrust of ‘the establishment’. In an age of historically
    low party membership, party identification, voter volatility, rising abstentionism
    and greater individualism, mainstream parties are struggling to be representative.
    This book is about the turbulent political scene unfolding in Britain and across
    western Europe. It focuses on why large swathes of voters feel that politics does
    not work, how this fuels support for insurgent parties and actors, and it investigates
    the power of democratic innovations. \n\nDrawing on new survey data in the UK,
    as well as interviews and case studies, the book shows that people are concerned
    with the process of politics, not merely its performance, and that they have a
    genuine desire for greater political participation in the decision-making process.
    These new forms of political engagement should not feel like a threat to formal
    systems of government, but as much-needed additions that enrich democracy. "

  abstract: 'Why are some nudges ineffective, or at least less effective than choice
    architects hope and expect? Focusing primarily on default rules, this essay emphasizes
    two reasons. The first involves strong antecedent preferences on the part of choosers.
    The second involves successful “counternudges,” which persuade people to choose
    in a way that confounds the efforts of choice architects. Nudges might also be
    ineffective, and less effective than expected, for five other reasons. (1) Some
    nudges produce confusion on the part of the target audience. (2) Some nudges have
    only short-term effects. (3) Some nudges produce “reactance” (though this appears
    to be rare) (4) Some nudges are based on an inaccurate (though initially plausible)
    understanding on the part of choice architects of what kinds of choice architecture
    will move people in particular contexts. (5) Some nudges produce compensating
    behavior, resulting in no net effect. When a nudge turns out to be insufficiently
    effective, choice architects have three potential responses: (1) Do nothing; (2)
    nudge better (or different); and (3) fortify the effects of the nudge, perhaps
    through counter-counternudges, perhaps through incentives, mandates, or bans.'

    The Open Democracy Advice Center (ODAC) in South Africa will be using mySociety's Alaveteli software in their latest project - and, with a bit of match-making from mySociety, the preparation period has been rigorous.

    Alaveteli is our open source Freedom of Information platform. It underlies our own UK-based WhatDoTheyKnow, and right-to-know site around the world. Alaveteli sites make it easy for citizens to ask questions of those bodies who operate under Freedom of Information law and, significantly, they automatically publish all responses. This blog post discusses mySociety's collaboration with Open Democracy Advice Center (ODAC) and Stanford University's d.school on design thinking further.

  abstract: 'Transparency is widely promoted as an essential condition for good governance,
    and as an effective tool against public sector corruption more specifically. Although
    the empirical evidence on the impact of transparency on corruption is growing,
    empirical evidence remains mixed. Recent critique holds that a main reason for
    the lack of robust empirical evidence is that both conceptualization and available
    measures of government transparency are broad and sometimes imprecise. This paper
    seeks to develop a more precise conceptualization and measure of transparency
    in the field of public procurement that is actionable for the stakeholders of
    government decisions. We use data of more than 4 million public procurement contracts
    between 2006-2015 to investigate the impact of transparency on high-level corruption
    risks in public procurement across Europe. We also link data from a unique large-scale
    regional survey to the public procurement dataset to study interactions between
    transparency and the wider public demand for accountability. We find a strong
    negative impact of overall tender transparency on corruption risks. The results
    also show that ex-ante transparency, i.e. transparency before the contract is
    awarded, has a stronger effect on corruption risks than ex-post transparency,
    i.e. the availability of information after the contract has been awarded to a
    bidder. This suggest that providing information to the parties involved in the
    bidding process rather than to outside observers, is the main condition for wider
    public accountability to emerge. However, the effectiveness of this type of transparency
    is strengthened in contexts where there is also a wider societal demand for reduced
    corruption. In sum, our results suggest that transparency can reduce corruption
    risks if the information is both relevant to inside observers and actionable. '

  abstract: "The Gartner hype cycle tracks how technologies develop for initial conception
    to productive use. There is much excitement around different methodologies and
    technologies in the \"government innovation\" space but which of these is hyped
    and which of these is truly productive?\n\nLast year we made some educated guesses
    and placed ten government innovations along the hype cycle. This year, however,
    we went for something bigger and better. We creatd an entirely non-scientific
    poll and asked respondents to tell us where they thought these same ten governmnt
    innovations sat on the hype cycle. \n\nThe innovations we included were artificial
    intelligence, blockchain, design thinking, policy labs, behavioral insights, open
    data, e-government, agile, lean and New Public Management. \n\nThe following report
    is what we learned."

  abstract: Is the co-existence of participatory and deliberative actions with the
    exercise of parliamentary office really feasible? In what way has Information
    and Communication Technology fostered interaction between parliamentary representatives
    and society at large in the daily round of legislative activities? Are we drawing
    closer to a hybrid system of representative and participatory democracy through
    the incorporation of effective ways of co-producing laws into legislative agendas?
    This work seeks to address those questions and evaluate other international experiences
    and experiments designed to achieve the same ends. The book is based on a study
    of two particular cases where parliamentary bodies designed and implemented participatory
    digital processes, namely, the e-Democracy Program developed by the Brazilian
    House of Representatives, and the Virtual Senator Program developed by the Chilean
    Senate. The text unfolds in the form of a systematic analysis of institutional
    aspects embracing political and organizational elements as well as the social
    aspects associated to the application of digital democracy in parliaments. The
    investigation shows that at the stage they found themselves in 2010 those projects
    had only brought in very incipient results in regard to the aspects of enhancing
    representativity in decision making processes, aggregating collective intelligence
    to the legislative process or transparency to parliamentary performances, even
    though all of those are precious components of any democracy that deems itself
    to be participatory and deliberative. Nevertheless, such experiences have had
    the merit of contributing towards the gradual construction of more effective participatory
    mechanisms, complementary to the political representation system in place.

  abstract: "‘Behaviour change’ has become a buzz phrase of growing importance to
    policymakers and researchers. There is an increasing focus on exploring the relationship
    between social organisation and individual action, and on intervening to influence
    societal outcomes like population health and climate change. Researchers continue
    to grapple with methodologies, intervention strategies and ideologies around ‘social
    change’. Multidisciplinary in approach, this important book draws together insights
    from a selection of the principal thinkers in fields including public health,
    transport, marketing, sustainability and technology. The book explores the political
    and historical landscape of behaviour change, and trends in academic theory, before
    examining new innovations in both practice and research. It will be a valuable
    resource for academics, policy makers, practitioners, researchers and students
    wanting to locate their thinking within this rapidly evolving field."

  abstract: Computing power and analytical methods allow us to create, collate, and
    analyze more data than ever before. When datasets are unusually large in volume,
    velocity, and variety, they are referred to as “big data.” Some observers have
    suggested that in order to cope with big data (a) organizational structures will
    need to change and (b) the processes used to design organizations will be different.
    In this article, we differentiate big data from relatively slow-moving, linked
    people data. We argue that big data will change organizational structures as organizations
    pursue the opportunities presented by big data. The processes by which organizations
    are designed, however, will be relatively unaffected by big data. Instead, organization
    design processes will be more affected by the complex links found in people data.

  abstract: Given the pace of discovery in medicine, accessing the literature to make
    informed decisions at the point of care has become increasingly difficult. Although
    the Internet creates unprecedented access to information, gaps in the medical
    literature and inefficient searches often leave healthcare providers' questions
    unanswered. Advances in social computation and human computer interactions offer
    a potential solution to this problem. We developed and piloted the mobile application
    DocCHIRP, which uses a system of point-to-multipoint push notifications designed
    to help providers problem solve by crowdsourcing from their peers. Over the 244-day
    pilot period, 85 registered users logged 1544 page views and sent 45 consult questions.
    The median initial first response from the crowd occurred within 19 minutes. Review
    of the transcripts revealed several dominant themes, including complex medical
    decision making and inquiries related to prescription medication use. Feedback
    from the post-trial survey identified potential hurdles related to medical crowdsourcing,
    including a reluctance to expose personal knowledge gaps and the potential risk
    for “distracted doctoring.” Users also suggested program modifications that could
    support future adoption, including changes to the mobile interface and mechanisms
    that could expand the crowd of participating healthcare providers.Journal of Hospital

  abstract: Massive volumes of data are increasingly being generated at unprecedented
    rates as a result of advances in information technology and developments such
    as use of expanded mobile capabilities (supported by more powerful and increasingly
    widespread bandwidth). New approaches to combining and “making sense of” large
    amounts of varied data—methods referred to as advanced analytics—are helping to
    uncover patterns, identify anomalies, and provide insights not suggested by a
    priori hypotheses. In fact, advanced algorithms are enabling the automation of
    functions that require the ability to reason; for example, an algorithm may use
    data on weather, traffic, and roadways to estimate and provide real-time information
    to drivers on traffic delays and congestion. At the January 2016 forum, participants
    from industry, government, academia and nonprofit organizations considered potential
    implications of these developments. Their discussion of emerging forms of data,
    analytics, and innovation pointed to a combined process or cycle in which relevant
    data are generated and subjected to analysis, so that results can be applied to
    innovative decision making or uses. We term this process “data and analytics innovation.”
    Consideration of related impacts spanned the economy and society, and included
    new opportunities with accompanying challenges, as well as potentially negative
    impacts. Following the forum, participants reviewed a summary of forum discussions,
    and two experts (who did not attend the forum) independently reviewed a draft
    of this report. The report does not necessarily represent the views of any individual
    participant or organization.

  abstract: "Objective: The objective of openFDA is to facilitate access and use of
    big important Food and Drug Administration public datasets by developers, researchers,
    and the public through harmonization of data across disparate FDA datasets provided
    via application programming interfaces (APIs). \n\nMaterials and Methods: Using
    cutting-edge technologies deployed on FDA’s new public cloud computing infrastructure,
    openFDA provides open data for easier, faster (over 300 requests per second per
    process), and better access to FDA datasets; open source code and documentation
    shared on GitHub for open community contributions of examples, apps and ideas;
    and infrastructure that can be adopted for other public health big data challenges.\n\nResults:
    Since its launch on June 2, 2014, openFDA has developed four APIs for drug and
    device adverse events, recall information for all FDA-regulated products, and
    drug labeling. There have been more than 20 million API calls (more than half
    from outside the United States), 6000 registered users, 20,000 connected Internet
    Protocol addresses, and dozens of new software (mobile or web) apps developed.
    A case study dem- onstrates a use of openFDA data to understand an apparent association
    of a drug with an adverse event.\n\nConclusion: With easier and faster access
    to these datasets, consumers worldwide can learn more about FDA-regulated products."

  abstract: Careful attention to choice architecture promises to open up new possibilities
    for reducing greenhouse gas emissions – possibilities that go well beyond, and
    that may supplement or complement, the standard tools of economic incentives,
    mandates, and bans. How, for example, do consumers choose between climate-friendly
    products or services and alternatives that are potentially damaging to the climate
    but less expensive? The answer may well depend on the default rule. Indeed, climate-friendly
    default rules may well be a more effective tool for altering outcomes than large
    economic incentives. The underlying reasons include the power of suggestion; inertia
    and procrastination; and loss aversion. If well-chosen, climate-friendly defaults
    are likely to have large effects in reducing the economic and environmental harms
    associated with various products and activities. In deciding whether to establish
    climate-friendly defaults, choice architects (subject to legal constraints) should
    consider both consumer welfare and a wide range of other costs and benefits. Sometimes
    that assessment will argue strongly in favor of climate-friendly defaults, particularly
    when both economic and environmental considerations point in their direction.
    Notably, surveys in the United States and Europe show that majorities in many
    nations are in favor of climate-friendly defaults.

  abstract: The potential of open data as a resource for driving citizen-led urban
    innovation relies not only on a suitable technical infrastructure but also on
    the skills and knowledge of the citizens themselves. This paper describes how
    a smart city project in Milton Keynes, UK, is supporting multiple stages of citizen
    innovation, from ideation through to citizen-led smart city projects. This approach
    encounters challenges when engaging with citizens in identifying and implementing
    data-driven solutions to urban problems. The majority of citizens have little
    practical experience with the types of data sets that might be availa- ble, nor
    possess the appropriate skills for their analysis and utilisation for ad- dressing
    urban issues, or finding novel ways to hack their city. We go on to de- scribe
    the Urban Data School, which aims to offer a long-term solution to this problem
    by providing teaching resources around urban data sets aimed at rais- ing the
    standard of data literacy amongst future generations. Lesson resources that form
    part of the Urban Data School have been piloted in a primary and two secondary
    schools in Milton Keynes.
