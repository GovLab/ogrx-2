  abstract: |-
    Many of us spend much of our time in meetings and at conferences. But too often these feel like a waste of time, or fail to make the most of the knowledge and experience of the people present.

    Meetings have changed - with much more use of online tools, and a growing range of different meeting formats. But our sense is that meetings could be much better
    run and achieve better results.

    This paper tries to help. It:
    ● summarises some of what's known about how meetings work well or badly;
    ● makes recommendations about how to make meetings better; and
    ● showcases some interesting recent innovations.

    It forms part of a larger research programme at Nesta on collective intelligence which is investigating how groups and organisations can make the most of their brains, and of the technologies they use.

    We hope the paper will be helpful to anyone designing or running meetings of any kind, and that readers will contribute good examples, ideas and evidence which can be added into future versions.

  abstract: Why do some societies manage to control corruption so that it manifests
    itself only occasionally, while other societies remain systemically corrupt? This
    book is about how societies reach that point when integrity becomes the norm and
    corruption the exception in regard to how public affairs are run and public resources
    are allocated. It primarily asks what lessons we have learned from historical
    and contemporary experiences in developing corruption control, which can aid policy-makers
    and civil societies in steering and expediting this process. Few states now remain
    without either an anticorruption agency or an Ombudsman, yet no statistical evidence
    can be found that they actually induce progress. Using both historical and contemporary
    studies and easy to understand statistics, Alina Mungiu-Pippidi looks at how to
    diagnose, measure and change governance so that those entrusted with power and
    authority manage to defend public resources.

  abstract: There are over 3 billion searches globally on Google every day. This report
    examines whether Google search queries can be used to predict the present and
    the near future unemployment rate in Finland. Predicting the present and the near
    future is of interest, as the official records of the state of the economy are
    published with a delay. To assess the information contained in Google search queries,
    the report compares a simple predictive model of unemployment to a model that
    contains a variable, Google Index, formed from Google data. In addition, cross-correlation
    analysis and Granger-causality tests are performed. Compared to a simple benchmark,
    Google search queries improve the prediction of the present by 10 % measured by
    mean absolute error. Moreover, predictions using search terms perform 39 % better
    over the benchmark for near future unemployment 3 months ahead. Google search
    queries also tend to improve the prediction accuracy around turning points. The
    results suggest that Google searches contain useful information of the present
    and the near future unemployment rate in Finland.

  abstract: Given the promise of open data – that is, the potential of open data to
    increase the credibility of institutions in the eyes of citizens through greater
    the transparency and greater accountability – we would suggest that the open data
    movement needs to develop a more nuanced understanding of how to institutionalise
    open data practices, particularly if open data practice is to become an enduring
    and taken-for-granted course of action by government agencies. While useful as
    mapping exercises, current enabler and barrier analyses on open data have not,
    we believe, drilled deep enough to provide reliable insights sensitive to the
    implementation context. There have undoubtedly been early successes on the open
    data supply side, but these successes are not yet unquali ed successes; questions
    remain regarding the sustainability of open data supply and about how ubiquitous
    supply is across government organisations. In the African context, there are fewer
    large-scale success stories, although there is evidence of commitments to opening
    up government data and of open data portals at state and/or regional government
    levels.

  abstract: As the second phase of the Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing
    Countries (ODDC) drew to a close, discussions started on a possible venue for
    publishing some of the papers that emerged from the research conducted by the
    project partners. In 2012 the Journal of Community Informatics published a special
    issue titled ‘Community Informatics and Open Government Data’. Given the journal’s
    previous interest in the field of open data, its established reputation and the
    fact that it is a peer-reviewed open access journal, the Journal of Community
    Informatics was approached and agreed to a second special issue with a focus on
    open data. A closed call for papers was sent out to the project research partners.
    Shortly afterwards, the first Open Data Research Symposium was held ahead of the
    International Open Data Conference 2015 in Ottawa, Canada. For the first time,
    a forum was provided to academics and researchers to present papers specifically
    on open data. Again there were discussions about an appropriate venue to publish
    selected papers from the Symposium. The decision was taken by the Symposium Programme
    Committee to invite the twenty plus presenters to submit full papers for consideration
    in the special issue. The seven papers published in this special issue are those
    that were selected through a double-blind peer review process.

  abstract: |-
    This research aims to explore the potential of the network e ect of the Internet (activity i.e. the service becomes more powerful when more people use it), emphasizing the characteristics of digital tools that can e ectively empower citizens and civic innovators.  e challenge is to exploit the collaborative power of networks (networks of people, of knowledge, and connected things) to harness the collective intelligence
    of communities in order to tackle big social challenges.  ere is great potential to exploit digital network e ects both in social innovation activity and in new services and approaches that generate social value. But much of this potential isn’t yet being realized. Indeed, the “network e ect” of the Internet may still be in its early technical phases and early implementation to maximize social good.

  abstract: 'In 2008 the first Swiss canton introduced internet voting for expatriates,
    thus initiating the second phase in Switzerland’s piecemeal i-voting roll-out.
    More cantons soon followed, and as of this writing expatriates from 12 out of
    the 26 cantons can vote online. This paper focuses on the second phase involving
    expatriates. We address three questions at the core of the internet voting research
    agenda. First, the popularity question: to what extent do expatriates make use
    of the new online channel? Second, the ‘who’ question: what is the profile of
    the typical expatriate i-voter? Finally, the turnout question: did the extension
    of internet voting to the expatriates have an effect on electoral mobilization?
    Our findings indicate that the online channel is very popular among expatriates,
    both if compared to other trials in Switzerland itself and internationally. On
    the other hand, known patterns regarding the profile of i-voters and the effect
    on mobilization seem to be also replicated in the expatriate trials. Expatriate
    i-voters tend to be young, male, and there is some evidence of an upper-class
    bias. Thus, usage of the online channel seems driven by the digital divide also
    among expatriates. Moreover, we find some evidence that i-voting did not affect
    electoral mobilization, similarly to trials involving residents.'

  abstract: "‘Behaviour change’ has become a buzz phrase of growing importance to
    policymakers and researchers. There is an increasing focus on exploring the relationship
    between social organisation and individual action, and on intervening to influence
    societal outcomes like population health and climate change. Researchers continue
    to grapple with methodologies, intervention strategies and ideologies around ‘social
    change’. Multidisciplinary in approach, this important book draws together insights
    from a selection of the principal thinkers in fields including public health,
    transport, marketing, sustainability and technology. The book explores the political
    and historical landscape of behaviour change, and trends in academic theory, before
    examining new innovations in both practice and research. It will be a valuable
    resource for academics, policy makers, practitioners, researchers and students
    wanting to locate their thinking within this rapidly evolving field."

    it and a surprising lack of theorization. In this paper I attempt to present a
    “grammar” of participation by looking at three cases where participation has been
    central in the contemporary moment of new, social media and the Internet as well
    as in the past, stretching back to the 1930s: citizen participation in public
    administration, workplace participation, and participatory international development.
    Across these three cases I demonstrate that the grammar of participation shifts
    from a language of normative enthusiasm to one of critiques of co-optation and
    bureaucratization and back again. I suggest that this perpetually aspirational
    logic results in the problem of “too much democracy in all the wrong places.”'

  abstract: 'The goals of big data and privacy are fundamentally opposed to each other.
    Big data and knowledge discovery are aimed reducing information asymmetries between
    organizations and the data sources, whereas privacy is aimed at maintaining information
    asymmetries of data sources. A number of different definitions of privacy are
    used to investigate some of the tensions between different characteristics of
    big data and potential privacy concerns. Specifically, the author examines the
    consequences of unevenness in big data, digital data going from local controlled
    settings to uncontrolled global settings, privacy effects of reputation monitoring
    systems, and inferring knowledge from social media. In addition, the author briefly
    analyzes two other emerging sources of big data: police cameras and stingray for
    location information.'

  abstract: 'Responsive City is a guide to civic engagement and governance in the
    digital age that will help leaders link important breakthroughs in technology
    and data analytics with age-old lessons of small-group community input to create
    more agile, competitive, and economically resilient cities. Featuring vivid case
    studies highlighting the work of pioneers in New York, Boston, Chicago and more,
    the book provides a compelling model for the future of governance. The book will
    help mayors, chief technology officers, city administrators, agency directors,
    civic groups and nonprofit leaders break out of current paradigms to collectively
    address civic problems. The Responsive City is the culmination of research originating
    from the Data-Smart City Solutions initiative, an ongoing project at Harvard Kennedy
    School working to catalyze adoption of data projects on the city level. The book
    is co-authored by Professor Stephen Goldsmith, director of Data-Smart City Solutions
    at Harvard Kennedy School, and Professor Susan Crawford, co-director of Harvard''s
    Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
    penned the book’s foreword.  Based on the authors’ experiences and extensive research,
    The Responsive City explores topics including: Building trust in the public sector
    and fostering a sustained, collective voice among communities; Using data-smart
    governance to preempt and predict problems while improving quality of life; Creating
    efficiencies and saving taxpayer money with digital tools; and Spearheading these
    new approaches to government with innovative leadership.

  abstract: This meta-analytic study reviews empirical research published from 2007
    to 2013 with an aim of providing robust conclusions about the relationship between
    social media use and citizen engagement. It includes 22 studies that used self-reported
    measures of social media use and participation, with a total of 116 relationships/effects.
    The results suggest that social media use generally has a positive relationship
    with engagement and its three sub-categories, that is, social capital, civic engagement,
    and political participation. More specifically, we find small-to-medium size positive
    relationships between expressive, informational, and relational uses of social
    media and the above indicators of citizen engagement. For identity- and entertainment-oriented
    uses of social media, our analyses find little evidence supporting their relationship
    with citizen engagement.

  abstract: Smart Urbanism (SU) – the rebuilding of cities through the integration
    of digital technologies with buildings, neighbourhoods, networked infrastructures
    and people – is being represented as a unique emerging ‘solution’ to the majority
    of problems faced by cities today. SU discourses, enacted by technology companies,
    national governments and supranational agencies alike, claim a supremacy of urban
    digital technologies for managing and controlling infrastructures, achieving greater
    effectiveness in managing service demand and reducing carbon emissions, developing
    greater social interaction and community networks, providing new services around
    health and social care etc. Smart urbanism is being represented as the response
    to almost every facet of the contemporary urban question.

  abstract: Information of all kinds is now being produced, collected, and analyzed
    at unprecedented speed, breadth, depth, and scale. The capacity to collect and
    analyze massive data sets has already transformed fields such as biology, astronomy,
    and physics, but the social sciences have been comparatively slower to adapt,
    and the path forward is less certain. For many, the big data revolution promises
    to ask, and answer, fundamental questions about individuals and collectives, but
    large data sets alone will not solve major social or scientific problems. New
    paradigms being developed by the emerging field of “computational social science”
    will be needed not only for research methodology, but also for study design and
    interpretation, cross-disciplinary collaboration, data curation and dissemination,
    visualization, replication, and research ethics (Lazer et al., 2009). SAGE Publishing
    conducted a survey with social scientists around the world to learn more about
    researchers engaged in big data research and the challenges they face, as well
    as the barriers to entry for those looking to engage in this kind of research
    in the future. We were also interested in the challenges of teaching computational
    social science methods to students. The survey was fully completed by 9412 respondents,
    indicating strong interest in this topic among our social science contacts. Of
    respondents, 33 percent had been involved in big data research of some kind and,
    of those who have not yet engaged in big data research, 49 percent (3057 respondents)
    said that they are either “definitely planning on doing so in the future” or “might
    do so in the future.”

  abstract: 'Transparency has become the watchword of twenty-first century liberal
    democracies. It refers to a project of ‘opening up’ the state by providing online
    access to public sector data. This article puts forward a sociological critique
    of the transparency agenda and the purported relationship between institutional
    openness and public trust. Drawing upon Simmel’s (1906) work, the article argues
    that open government initiatives routinely prize visibility over intelligibility
    and ignore the communicative basis of trust. The result is a non-reciprocal form
    of openness that obscures more than it reveals. In making this point, the article
    suggests that transparency embodies the ethos of a now-discredited mode of ‘instrumental
    politics’, reliant on the idea that the state constitutes a ‘domain of plain public
    facts’ (Ezrahi, 2004: 106). The article examines how alternative mechanisms for
    achieving government openness might better respond to the distinctive needs of
    citizens living in late modern societies.'

    Purpose
    – The purpose of this paper is to develop a method for better analyzing the utility and impact of new technologies on smart cities. The authors have designed a tool that will evaluate new technologies according to a three-pronged scoring system that considers the impact on physical space, environmental issues and city residents. The purpose of this tool is to be used by city planners as part of a strategic approach to the implementation of a smart city initiative in order to reduce unnecessary public spending and ensure the optimal allocation of city resources.

    Design/methodology/approach
    – The information and communication technologies that manage and transform twenty-first century cities must be reviewed, analyzing their impact on new social behaviors that shape the spaces and means of communication, developing a new methodology and setting the basis for an analysis matrix to score the different and technologies that affect a smart city environment.

    Research limitations/implications
    – Traditional technological scenarios have been challenged, and smart cities have become the center of urban competitiveness. A lack of clarity has been detected in the way of describing what smart cities are, and the authors try to establish a methodology for urban policy makers to do so. As a dynamic process that affects several aspects, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed solution further.

    Practical implications
    – After a review of the state-of-the-art, the authors found that there are no existing systems for assessing smart city strategies regarding new, evolving technologies. The methodology attempts to design a simple tool to bring urban developers and policy makers closer to the technology and to have an instrument with which to compare different alternatives before choosing one.

    Social implications
    – Helped by new technologies, citizens are the ones who have the power to define new urban scenarios. For this reason the methodology the authors propose must have citizens and their needs as the ultimate reference, considering all the social, physical and environmental effects on people before selecting a new technology for urban strategies.

    Originality/value
    – This paper fulfills an identified need to study how new technologies could affect urban scenarios before being applied, developing an analysis system in the form of a matrix to be used by urban planners and policy makers to decide how best to use them.

  abstract: 'This critical and scoping review essay analyses digital labour markets
    where labour-intensive services are traded by matching requesters (employers and/or
    consumers) and providers (workers). It focuses on digital labour markets which
    allow the remote delivery of electronically transmittable services (i.e. Amazon
    Mechanical Turk, Upwork, Freelancers, etc.) and those where the matching and administration
    processes are digital but the delivery of the services is physical and requires
    direct interaction. The former broad type is called Online Labour Markets (OLMs)
    and is potentially global. The latter broad type is termed Mobile Labour Markets
    (MLMs) and is by definition localised. The essay defines and conceptualises these
    markets proposing a typology which proves to be empirically valid and heuristically
    useful. It describes their functioning and the socio-demographic profiles of the
    participants, reviews their economic and social effects, discusses the possible
    policy implications, and concludes with a research agenda to support European
    level policy making. It alternates the discussion of ‘hard’ findings from experimental
    and quasi-experimental studies with analysis of ‘softer’ issues such as rhetorical
    discourses and media ‘hyped’ accounts. This triangulation is inspired by, and
    a tribute to, the enduring legacy of the work of Albert O. Hirschman and his view
    that ideas and rhetoric can become endogenous engines of social change, reforms,
    and policies. This essay tries to disentangle the rhetoric with available empirical
    evidence in order to enable a more rational debate at least in the discussion
    of policies, if not in the public arena. To do so, an in depth analysis of 39
    platforms was undertaken together with a formal review of 70 scientific sources.
    These two main sources have been integrated with: a) an exploration of 100 media
    accounts (business press, newspapers, magazines, and blogs); b) 50 reports and
    surveys produced by ‘interested parties’ (industrial associations, platforms own
    reports and public relation materials, think tanks with a clear political orientation,
    NGOs, trade unions, etc.); and c) about 200 indirectly relevant scientific contributions
    and policy reports (used as sources to contextualise and integrate the above sources,
    and to derive theoretical and interpretative insights). While the evidence is
    limited and inconclusive with respect to various dimensions, the findings of this
    essay show, among other things, that: a) individuals engage in these activities
    primarily for money, for a large segment of them this work is their primary source
    of income, and most are under-employed and self-employed and fewer are unemployed
    and inactive; b) matching frictions and hiring inefficiencies are widespread and
    even the OLMs are far from being globalised online meritocracies; c) a behavioural
    approach to big data exploration should be further applied because there is emerging
    evidence of heuristic and biases contributing to hiring inefficiencies.'

  abstract: |-
    In this paper we study the public debate over net neutrality in the United States from January through
    November 2014. We compiled, mapped, and analyzed over 16,000 stories published on net neutrality,
    augmented by data from Twitter, bit.ly, and Google Trends. Using a mixed-methods approach that
    combines link analysis with qualitative content analysis, we describe the evolution of the debate over time
    and assess the role, reach, and influence of different media sources and advocacy groups in setting the
    agenda, framing the debate, and mobilizing collective action. We conclude that a diverse set of actors
    working in conjunction through the networked public sphere played a central, arguably decisive, role in
    turning around the Federal Communications Commission policy on net neutrality.

  abstract: Critics frequently argue that nudges are more covert, less transparent,
    and more difficult to monitor than traditional regulatory tools. Edward Glaeser,
    for example, argues that “[p]ublic monitoring of soft paternalism is much more
    difficult than public monitoring of hard paternalism.” As one of the leading proponents
    of soft paternalism, Cass Sunstein, acknowledges, while “[m]andates and commands
    are highly visible,” soft paternalism, “and some nudges in particular[,] may be
    invisible.” In response to this challenge, proponents of nudging argue that invisibility
    for any given individual in a particular choice environment is compatible with
    “careful public scrutiny” of the nudge. This paper offers first of its kind experimental
    evidence that tests whether nudges are, in fact, compatible with careful public
    scrutiny. Using two sets of experiments, the paper argues that, even when made
    visible, nudges attract less scrutiny than their “hard law” counterparts.

  abstract: 'This article shows how activists in the open data movement re-articulate
    notions of democracy, participation, and journalism by applying practices and
    values from open source culture to the creation and use of data. Focusing on the
    Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews
    and content analysis, it argues that this process leads activists to develop new
    rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied publics.
    Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a
    prerequisite for generating knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source
    code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should break the interpretative
    monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation
    of data about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and
    flexible form of representative democracy by applying the open source model of
    participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermediaries
    are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an
    interest in transforming journalism to become an intermediary in this sense. At
    the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic
    technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting
    that the practices and ideas of open data activists are relevant because they
    illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help
    to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors
    outside big government and big business.'

  abstract: |-
    The economic and social potential of open data is widely acknowledged. In particular, the business opportunities have received much attention. But for all the excitement, we still know very little about how and under what conditions open data really works.

    To broaden our understanding of the use and impact of open data, the GovLab has a variety of initiatives and studies underway. Today, we share publicly our findings on how Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are leveraging open data for a variety of purposes. Our paper “Open Data: A 21st Century Asset for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises” seeks to build a portrait of the lifecycle of open data—how it is collected, stored and used. It outlines some of the most important parameters of an open data business model for SMEs.

    The universe of SMEs we analyzed comprised those identified within the GovLab’s Open Data 500 project which contains data on how 500 US businesses are using open data in their day-to-day activities. It represents arguably the first systematic effort to really understand how open data can grow revenues, drive innovation, increase efficiency and create new jobs.

    The paper analyzes ten aspects of open data and establishes ten principles for its effective use by SMEs. Taken together, these offer a roadmap for any SME considering greater use or adoption of open data in its business.

    Among the key findings included in the paper:

    SMEs, which often lack access to data or sophisticated analytical tools to process large datasets, are likely to be one of the chief beneficiaries of open data.
    Government data is the main category of open data being used by SMEs. A number of SMEs are also using open scientific and shared corporate data.
    Open data is used primarily to serve the Business-to-Business (B2B) markets, followed by the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) markets. A number of the companies studied serve two or three market segments simultaneously.
    Open data is usually a free resource, but SMEs are monetizing their open-data-driven services to build viable businesses. The most common revenue models include subscription-based services, advertising, fees for products and services, freemium models, licensing fees, lead generation and philanthropic grants.
    The most significant challenges SMEs face in using open data include those concerning data quality and consistency, insufficient financial and human resources, and issues surrounding privacy.
    This is just a sampling of findings and observations. The paper includes a number of additional observations concerning business and revenue models, product development, customer acquisition, and other subjects of relevance to any company considering an open data strategy.

    The paper was funded by the Markle Foundation and written to inform Markle’s Rework America Initiative.

  abstract: Presenting rigorous and original research, this volume offers key insights
    into the historical, cultural, social, economic and political forces at play in
    the creation of world-class ICT innovations in Kenya. Following the arrival of
    fiber-optic cables in 2009, Digital Kenya examines why the initial entrepreneurial
    spirit and digital revolution has begun to falter despite support from motivated
    entrepreneurs, international investors, policy experts and others. Written by
    engaged scholars and professionals in the field, the book offers 15 eye-opening
    chapters and 14 one-on-one conversations with entrepreneurs and investors to ask
    why establishing ICT start-ups on a continental and global scale remains a challenge
    on the “Silicon Savannah”. The authors present evidence-based recommendations
    to help Kenya to continue producing globally impactful ICT innovations that improve
    the lives of those still waiting on the side-lines, and to inspire other nations
    to do the same.

  abstract: In 2011, Indonesia started its Open Government journey when along with
    seven other countries it initiated Open Government Partnership. Following the
    global declaration, Indonesia launched the Open Government Indonesia (OGI) in
    January 2012 with the aim to introduce open government reforms, including open
    data. This initiative is supported by Law No. 14/2008 on Freedom of Information.
    Despite its early stage, the implementation of Open Government in Indonesia has
    shown promising developments, with three action plans enacted in the last four
    years. In the Southeast Asian region, Indonesia could be considered a pioneer
    in implementing the open data initiative at national as well as sub-national levels.
    In some cases, the open data initiative at sub-national level has even surpassed
    the progress at the national level. Jakarta, for example, became the first city
    to have its own gubernatorial bylaw on data and system management, which requires
    the city administration and agencies to open its public data, thus leading to
    the birth of open data initiatives in the city. The city also have Jakarta Smart
    City that connect sub-districts officials with the citizen. Jakarta Smart City
    is an initiative that promote openness of the government through public service
    delivery. This paper aims to take a closer look on the dynamics of citizens-generated
    data in Jakarta and how Jakarta smart city program contributes to the implementation
    of open data.

  abstract: |-
    Open data can: i) more effectively target aid money and improve development programmes, ii) track development progress and prevent corruption, and iii) contribute to innovation, job creation and economic growth.

    To achieve these aims, the development community must address many challenges, including: a weak enabling environment for open data publishing; poor data quality; a mismatch between the demand for open data and the supply of appropriate datasets; a ‘digital divide’ between rich and poor, affecting both the supply and use of data; and a general lack of quantifiable data and metrics.

    With these challenges in mind, the report sets out ways that governments, donors and (international) NGOs – with the support of researchers, civil society and industry – can apply open data to help make the SDGs a reality:

    1. Reach global consensus around principles and standards, namely being ‘open by default’, using the Open Government Partnership’s Open Data Working Group as a global forum for discussion.
    2. Embed open data into funding agreements, ensuring that relevant, high-quality data is collected to report against the SDGs. Funders should mandate that data relating to performance of services, and data produced as a result of funded activity, be released as open data.
    3. Build a global partnership for sustainable open data, so that groups across the public and private sectors can work together to build sustainable supply and demand for data in the developing world.

  abstract: This book provides insights on how emerging technosciences come together
    with new forms of governance and ethical questioning. Combining science and technologies
    and ethics approaches, it looks at the emergence of three key technoscientific
    domains - body enhancement technologies, biometrics and technologies for the production
    of space -exploring how human bodies and minds, the movement of citizens and space
    become matters of technoscientific governance. The emergence of new and digital
    technologies pose new challenges for representative democracy and existing forms
    of citizenship. As citizens encounter and have to adapt to technological change
    in their everyday life, new forms of conviviality and contestation emerge. This
    book is a key reference for scholars interested in the governance of emerging
    technosciences in the fields of science and technology studies and ethics.

  abstract: |-
    In 2011, the Department of Interior and Local Government of the Philippines mandated the implementation of the Full Disclosure Policy that requires local government units (LGUs) to post financial and procurement –related information in LGU websites. To date, more than 75% of the local government units in the country have complied. This research investigates whether the provision of local government information through government websites has affected both the providers of the information and its supposed audience – the public, as represented by citizen groups. To answer the questions, the researchers made use of a case study approach by selecting three provinces as research sites. The primary methods used were review of secondary data, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews.
    The research found out two major significant findings. On the supply side, incentivising openness is a critical aspect in ensuring that local governments have the interest to disclose financial data. While at this stage, local governments are still on compliance behaviour, it encourages the once reluctant LGUs to disclose financial information in the use of public funds, especially when technology and institutional arrangements are in place. However, LGUs do not make an effort to inform the public that information is available online and has not made data accessible in such a way that it can allow the public to perform computations and analysis. Currently, no data standards have been made yet by the Philippine national government in terms of format and level of detail. On the demand side, there is limited awareness on the part of the public, and more particularly the intermediaries (e.g. business groups, civil society organizations, research institutions), on the availability of data, and thus, its limited use. As most of these data are financial in nature, it requires a certain degree of competence and expertise so that they will be able to make use of the data in demanding from government better services and accountability.
    This paper argues that openness is not just about governments putting meaningful government data out into the public domain, but also about making the public meaningfully engage with governments through the use of open government data. This requires policies that will require observance of open government data standards and a capacity building process of ensuring that the public, to whom the data is intended, are aware and able to use the data in ensuring more transparent and accountable governance.

  abstract: The potential of open data as a resource for driving citizen-led urban
    innovation relies not only on a suitable technical infrastructure but also on
    the skills and knowledge of the citizens themselves. This paper describes how
    a smart city project in Milton Keynes, UK, is supporting multiple stages of citizen
    innovation, from ideation through to citizen-led smart city projects. This approach
    encounters challenges when engaging with citizens in identifying and implementing
    data-driven solutions to urban problems. The majority of citizens have little
    practical experience with the types of data sets that might be availa- ble, nor
    possess the appropriate skills for their analysis and utilisation for ad- dressing
    urban issues, or finding novel ways to hack their city. We go on to de- scribe
    the Urban Data School, which aims to offer a long-term solution to this problem
    by providing teaching resources around urban data sets aimed at rais- ing the
    standard of data literacy amongst future generations. Lesson resources that form
    part of the Urban Data School have been piloted in a primary and two secondary
    schools in Milton Keynes.

  abstract: When like-minded people discuss with each other, i.e. engage in ‘enclave
    deliberation’, their opinions tend to become more extreme. This is called group
    polarization. A population-based experiment with a pre-test post-test design was
    conducted to analyze whether the norms and procedures of deliberation interfere
    with the mechanisms of group polarization. Based on a survey, people with either
    permissive or restrictive attitudes toward immigration were first identified and
    then invited to the experiment. The participants were randomly assigned to like-minded
    and mixed small-n groups. Each like-minded group consisted of only permissive
    or restrictive participants, whereas each mixed group consisted of four permissive
    and four restrictive participants. The like-minded treatment represents enclave
    deliberation, and the mixed treatment a ‘standard’ deliberative mini-public design.
    The main finding of our experiment is that people with anti-immigrant attitudes
    become more tolerant even when they deliberate in like-minded groups. Moreover,
    similar learning curves are observed in both treatments. Based on the results,
    we conclude that deliberative norms can alleviate the negative consequences of
    discussion in like-minded groups.

    “Think for Tigers” study to explore whether crowdsourcing has the potential to
    innovate the way researchers and practitioners monitor tigers in the wild. The
    study demonstrated that the benefits of crowdsourcing are not restricted only
    to harnessing the time, labor, and funds from the public but can also be used
    as a tool to harness creative thinking that can contribute to development of new
    research tools and approaches. Based on our experience, we make practical recommendations
    for designing a crowdsourcing initiative as a tool for generating ideas.\n\n"

    In this extraordinary follow-up to the critically acclaimed The Lucifer Principle, Howard Bloom-one of today's preeminent thinkers-offers us a bold rewrite of the evolutionary saga. He shows how plants and animals (including humans) have evolved together as components of a worldwide learning machine. He describes the network of life on Earth as one that is, in fact, a ""complex adaptive system,"" a global brain in which each of us plays a sometimes conscious, sometimes unknowing role. and he reveals that the World Wide Web is just the latest step in the development of this brain. These are theories as important as they are radical. Informed by twenty years of interdisciplinary research, Bloom takes us on a spellbinding journey back to the big bang to let us see how its fires forged primordial sociality. As he brings us back via surprising routes, we see how our earliest bacterial ancestors built multitrillion-member research and development teams a full 3.5 billion years ago. We watch him unravel the previously unrecognized strands of interconnectedness woven by crowds of trilobites, hunting packs of dinosaurs, feathered flying lizards gathered in flocks, troops of baboons making communal decisions, and adventurous tribes of protohumans spreading across continents but still linked by primitive forms of information networking. We soon find ourselves reconsidering our place in the world. Along the way, Bloom offers us exhilarating insights into the strange tricks of body and mind that have organized a variety of life forms: spiny lobsters, which, during the Paleozoic age, participated in communal marching rituals; and bees, which, during the age of dinosaurs, conducted collective brainwork. This fascinating tour continues on to the sometimes brutal subculture wars that have spurred the growth of human civilization since the Stone Age. Bloom shows us how culture shapes our infant brains, immersing us in a matrix of truth and mass delusion that we think of as reality.

    Global Brain is more than just a brilliantly original contribution to the ongoing debate on the inner workings of evolution. It is a ""grand vision,"" says the eminent evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson, a work that transforms our very view of who we are and why.

  abstract: The Open Data movement has mainly been a data provision movement. The
    release of Open Data is usually motivated by (i) government transparency (citizen
    access to government data), (ii) the development of services by third parties
    for the benefit for citizens and companies (typically smart city approach), or
    (iii) the development of new services that stimulate the economy. The success
    of the Open Data movement and its return on investment should therefore be assessed
    among other criteria by the number and impact of the services created based on
    those data. In this paper, we study the development of services based on open
    data and means to make the data opening process more effective.

  abstract: |-
    Access to information, freedom of media and citizen participation in governance processes are some of the main pillars of the Kenyan Constitution. Therefore, the open data initiative holds the potential for increased engagement between the government and the public. Evans & Campos (2012) note that greater citizen empowerment could be achieved through more concerted approaches that consider and provide contextual information. This research sought to understand how this relationship has evolved over the years since the initiative’s inception, and to address potential areas of improvement to allow for greater utilization of government information by the communities. More speci cally, the study sought to:
    a) Investigate the impact of the Kenyan Government’s open data initiative and to see whether, and if so how, it is assisting marginalized communities and groups in accessing key social services and information such as health and education;11
    b) Understand the way people use the information provided by the Open Data Initiative;
    c) Identify people’s trust in the information and how it can assist their day-to-day lives;
    d) Examine ways in which the public wish for the open data initiative to improve, particularly in relation to governance and service delivery

  abstract: Algorithms (particularly those embedded in search engines, social media
    platforms, recommendation systems, and information databases) play an increasingly
    important role in selecting what information is considered most relevant to us,
    a crucial feature of our participation in public life. As we have embraced computational
    tools as our primary media of expression, we are subjecting human discourse and
    knowledge to the procedural logics that undergird computation. What we need is
    an interrogation of algorithms as a key feature of our information ecosystem,
    and of the cultural forms emerging in their shadows, with a close attention to
    where and in what ways the introduction of algorithms into human knowledge practices
    may have political ramifications. This essay is a conceptual map to do just that.
    It proposes a sociological analysis that does not conceive of algorithms as abstract,
    technical achievements, but suggests how to unpack the warm human and institutional
    choices that lie behind them, to see how algorithms are called into being by,
    enlisted as part of, and negotiated around collective efforts to know and be known.

  abstract: Epidemiology has made advances, thanks to the availability of real-time
    surveillance data and by leveraging the geographic analysis of incidents. There
    are many health information systems that visualize the symptoms of influenza-like
    illness on a digital map, which is suitable for end-users, but it does not afford
    further processing and analysis. Existing systems have emphasized the collection,
    analysis, and visualization of surveillance data, but they have neglected a modular
    and interoperable design that integrates high-resolution geo-location with real-time
    data. As a remedy, we have built an open-source project and we have been operating
    an open service that detects flu-related symptoms and shares the data in real-time
    with anyone who wants to built upon this system. An analysis of a small number
    of precisely geo-located status updates (e.g. Twitter) correlates closely with
    the Google Flu Trends and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention flu-positive
    reports. We suggest that public health information systems should embrace an open-source
    approach and offer linked data, in order to facilitate the development of an ecosystem
    of applications and services, and in order to be transparent to the general public
    interest.

  abstract: "Intelligence does not arise only in individual brains; it also arises
    in groups of individuals. This is collective intelligence: groups of individuals
    acting collectively in ways that seem intelligent. In recent years, a new kind
    of collective intelligence has emerged: interconnected groups of people and computers,
    collectively doing intelligent things. Today these groups are engaged in tasks
    that range from writing software to predicting the results of presidential elections.
    This volume reports on the latest research in the study of collective intelligence,
    laying out a shared set of research challenges from a variety of disciplinary
    and methodological perspectives. Taken together, these essays—by leading researchers
    from such fields as computer science, biology, economics, and psychology—lay the
    foundation for a new multidisciplinary field. \n\nEach essay describes the work
    on collective intelligence in a particular discipline—for example, economics and
    the study of markets; biology and research on emergent behavior in ant colonies;
    human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence; and cognitive psychology
    and the “wisdom of crowds” effect. Other areas in social science covered include
    social psychology, organizational theory, law, and communications. "

  abstract: A number of NGOs across the world currently develop digital tools to increase
    citizen interaction with official information. The successful operation of such
    tools depends on the expertise and efficiency of the NGO, and the willingness
    of institutions to disclose suitable information and data. It is this institutional
    interaction with civic technology that this study  examines. The research explores
    empirical interview data gathered from government officials, public servants,
    campaigners and NGO's involved in the development and implementation of civic
    technologies in Chile, Argentina and Mexico. The findings identify the impact
    these technologies have had upon government bureaucracy, and the existing barriers
    to openness created by institutionalised behaviours and norms. Institutionalised
    attitudes to information rights and conventions are shown to inform the approach
    that government bureaucracy takes in the provision of information, and institutionalised
    procedural behaviour is shown to be a factor in frustrating NGOs attempting to
    implement civic technology.

  abstract: Efficient and thorough data collection and its timely analysis are critical
    for disaster response and recovery in order to save peoples lives during disasters.
    However, access to comprehensive data in disaster areas and their quick analysis
    to transform the data to actionable knowledge are challenging. With the popularity
    and pervasiveness of mobile devices, crowdsourcing data collection and analysis
    has emerged as an effective and scalable solution. This paper addresses the problem
    of crowdsourcing mobile videos for disasters by identifying two unique challenges
    of 1) prioritizing visual-data collection and transmission under bandwidth scarcity
    caused by damaged communication networks and 2) analyzing the acquired data in
    a timely manner. We introduce a new crowdsourcing framework for acquiring and
    analyzing the mobile videos utilizing fine granularity spatial metadata of videos
    for a rapidly changing disaster situation. We also develop an analytical model
    to quantify the visual awareness of a video based on its metadata and propose
    the visual awareness maximization problem for acquiring the most relevant data
    under bandwidth constraints. The collected videos are evenly distributed to off-site
    analysts to collectively minimize crowdsourcing efforts for analysis. Our simulation
    results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework.

  abstract: "Improving public health is a major responsibility of any government,
    and is of major interest to citizens and scientific communities around the world.
    Here, one sees two extremes. On one hand, tremendous progress has been made in
    recent years in the understanding of causes, spread and remedies of common and
    regularly occurring diseases like Dengue, Malaria and Japanese Encephalistis (JE).
    On the other hand, public agencies treat these diseases in an ad hoc manner without
    learning from the experiences of previous years. Specifically, they would get
    alerted once reported cases have already arisen substantially in the known disease
    season, reactively initiate a few actions and then document the disease impact
    (cases, deaths) for that period, only to forget this learning in the next season.
    However, they miss the opportunity to reduce preventable deaths and sickness,
    and their corresponding economic impact, which scientific progress could have
    enabled. The gap is universal but very prominent in developing countries like
    India.\n\n \n\nIn this paper, we show that if public agencies provide historical
    disease impact information openly, it can be analyzed with statistical and machine
    learning techniques, correlated with best emerging practices in disease control,
    and simulated in a setting to optimize social benefits to provide timely guidance
    for new disease seasons and regions. We illustrate using open data for mosquito-borne
    communicable diseases; published results in public health on efficacy of Dengue
    control methods and apply it on a simulated typical city for maximal benefits
    with available resources. The exercise helps us further suggest strategies for
    new regions that may be anywhere in the world, how data could be better recorded
    by city agencies and what prevention methods should medical community focus on
    for wider impact."

  abstract: Political leaders and civic advocates are increasingly recommending that
    open access be the “default state” for much of the information held by government
    agencies. Over the past several years, they have driven the launch of open data
    initiatives across hundreds of national, state, and local governments. These initiatives
    are founded on a presumption of openness for government data and have led to the
    public release of large quantities data through a variety of channels. At the
    same time, much of the data that have been released, or are being considered for
    release, pertain to the behavior and characteristics of individual citizens, highlighting
    tensions between open data and privacy. This research briefing offers a snapshot
    of recent developments in the open data and privacy landscape, outlines an action
    map of various governance approaches to protecting privacy when releasing open
    data, and identifies key opportunities for decision-makers seeking to respond
    to challenges in this space.

  abstract: 'Transparency’s importance as an administrative norm seems self-evident.
    Prevailing ideals of political theory stipulate that the more visible government
    is, the more democratic, accountable, and legitimate it appears. The disclosure
    of state information consistently disappoints, however: there is never enough
    of it, while it often seems not to produce a truer democracy, a more accountable
    state, better policies, and a more contented populace. This gap between theory
    and practice suggests that the theoretical assumptions that provide the basis
    for transparency are wrong. This article argues that transparency is best understood
    as a theory of communication that excessively simplifies and thus is blind to
    the complexities of the contemporary state, government information, and the public.
    Taking them fully into account, the article argues, should lead us to question
    the state’s ability to control information, which in turn should make us question
    not only the improbability of the state making itself visible, but also the improbability
    of the state keeping itself secret.'

  abstract: |-
    Nowadays there is a multitude of mobile and tablet applications being developed in order to facilitate or disrupt every day tasks. Many of these are location based. A technique to serve in providing information and content is crowdsourcing. This technique is based on the public contributing information or resources giving them the opportunity to become both service providers and recipients at the same time.

    Taking into account the above and after observing passengers using the public transport system, we came to the conclusion that it would be useful to be able to determine which transport medium (i.e which bus line out of a number running concurrently) is nearer at any given moment. This information allows for better decision making and choice of transportation.

    For this we propose the development of an application to show the position of a selected transport vehicle. The position will be calculated based on geo-tracking provided by passengers boarded on a vehicle. This will allow for real time information to the application users in order to be able to determine their optimal route.

  abstract: How will big data impact environmental law in the near future? This Essay
    imagines one possible future for environmental law in 2030 that focuses on the
    implications of big data for the protection of public health from risks associated
    with pollution and industrial chemicals. It assumes the perspective of an historian
    looking back from the end of the twenty-first century at the evolution of environmental
    law during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The premise of
    the Essay is that big data will drive a major shift in the underlying knowledge
    practices of environmental law (along with other areas of law focused on health
    and safety). This change in the epistemic foundations of environmental law, it
    is argued, will in turn have important, far-reaching implications for environmental
    law’s normative commitments and for its ability to discharge its statutory responsibilities.
    In particular, by significantly enhancing the ability of environmental regulators
    to make harm more visible and more traceable, big data will put considerable pressure
    on previous understandings of acceptable risk across populations, pushing toward
    a more singular and more individualized understanding of harm. This will raise
    new and difficult questions regarding environmental law’s capacity to confront
    and take responsibility for the actual lives caught up in the tragic choices it
    is called upon to make. In imagining this near future, the Essay takes a somewhat
    exaggerated and, some might argue, overly pessimistic view of the implications
    of big data for environmental law’s efforts to protect public health. This is
    done not out of a conviction that such a future is likely, but rather to highlight
    some of the potential problems that may arise as big data becomes a more prominent
    part of environmental protection. In an age of data triumphalism, such a perspective,
    it is hoped, may provide grounds for a more critical engagement with the tools
    and knowledge practices that inform environmental law and the implications of
    those tools for environmental law’s ability to meet its obligations. Of course,
    there are other possible futures, and big data surely has the potential to make
    many positive contributions to environmental protection in the coming decades.
    Whether it will do so will depend in no small part on the collective choices we
    make to manage these new capabilities in the years ahead.
