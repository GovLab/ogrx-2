  abstract: This powerful resource identifies wide-scale health challenges facing
    a rapidly urbanizing planet--including key concerns in nutrition, health status,
    health care, and safety--and strategies toward possible solutions. Theoretical
    and empirical analysis focuses on maximizing the benefits of urban living and
    minimizing negative outcomes across areas for improvement (health education, maternal
    and child health) and threats to well-being (noise pollution, drug counterfeiting).
    For each challenge, contributors discuss implications for health, specific practices
    that fuel them, and emerging ideas for solving them efficiently and effectively.
    Not only are these issues of immediate salience, they will become dangerously
    urgent in years to come.

  abstract: |-
    Today, the generation and use of huge volumes of data are redefining our “intelligence” capacity and our social and economic landscapes, spurring new industries, processes and products, and creating significant competitive advantages. In this sense, data-driven innovation (DDI) has become a key pillar of 21st-century growth, with the potential to significantly enhance productivity, resource efficiency, economic competitiveness, and social well-being.

    Greater access to and use of data create a wide array of impacts and policy challenges, ranging from privacy and consumer protection to open access issues and measurement concerns, across public and private health, legal and science domains. This report aims to improve the evidence base on the role of DDI for promoting growth and well-being, and provide policy guidance on how to maximise the benefits of DDI and mitigate the associated economic and societal risks.

  abstract: Respect for privacy and the individual’s right to control their own data
    is becoming a key competitive parameter. Companies, organisations and authorities
    that treat data ethics as a social responsibility as important as environmental
    awareness and respect for human rights are tomorrow’s winners. Digital trust is
    paramount for digital growth and welfare. This book combines broad trend analysis
    with case studies of companies working with data ethics to varying degrees. The
    authors make the case how citizens and consumers are no longer just concerned
    about their lack of control over data, but also have begun to act, and how alternative
    business models, advances in technology and a new European data protection regulation
    combined foster a growing market for data ethical products and services. It provides
    a critical and fresh look at tech trends and the ethical dilemmas intertwined
    with them. It is a book for responsible players on how to get started with data
    ethics and how to use it to develop digital trust. The book is supported by Internet
    Society (isoc.org).

  abstract: 'This book provides key strategic principles and best practices to guide
    the design and implementation of digital government strategies. It provides a
    series of recommendations and findings to think about IT applications in government
    as a platform for information, services and collaboration, and strategies to avoid
    identified pitfalls. Digital government research suggests that information technologies
    have the potential to generate immense public value and transform the relationships
    between governments, citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders. However, developing
    innovative and high impact solutions for citizens hinges on the development of
    strategic institutional, organizational and technical capabilities. Thus far,
    particular characteristics and problems of the public sector organization promote
    the development of poorly integrated and difficult to maintain applications. For
    example, governments maintain separate applications for open data, transparency,
    and public services, leading to duplication of efforts and a waste of resources.
    The costs associated with maintaining such sets of poorly integrated systems may
    limit the use of resources to future projects and innovation. This book provides
    best practices and recommendations based on extensive research in both Mexico
    and the United States on how governments can develop a digital government strategy
    for creating public value, how to finance digital innovation in the public sector,
    how to build successful collaboration networks and foster citizen engagement,
    and how to correctly implement open government projects and open data. It will
    be of interest to researchers, practitioners, students and the public sector IT
    professionals that work in the design and implementation of technology-based project
    and programs. '

  abstract: In this paper, published at CHI ’17, we examine deliberative quality of
    crowdsourced deliberation. Analyzing data from two crowdsourced policy-making
    processes, we found a good quality deliberation with respect, reciprocity, and
    storytelling according to the standards in the theory of deliberative democracy.
    We identified a group of super-deliberators, whose deliberation was above the
    average, and low-quality deliberators, whose deliberation was below the average.
    The findings show that even when crowdsourced policymaking was not designed for
    deliberation, it can facilitate a fairly high-quality democratic deliberation.

  abstract: In an era of increasing dependence on data science and big data, the voices
    of one set of major stakeholders - the world's children and those who advocate
    on their behalf - have been largely absent. A recent paper estimates one in three
    global internet users is a child, yet there has be little rigorous debate or understanding
    of how to adapt traditional, offline ethical standards for research involving
    data collection from children, to a big data, online environment (Livingstone
    et al., 2015). This paper argues that due to the potential for severe, long-lasting
    and differential impacts on children, child reights need to be firmly integrated
    onto the agendas of global debates about ethics and data science. The authors
    outline their rationale for a greater focus on child rights and ethics in data
    science and suggest steps to move forward, focusing on the various actors within
    the data chain including data generators, collectors, analysts and end-users.
    It concludes by calling for a much stronger appreciation of the links between
    child rights, ethics and data science disciplines and for enhanced discourse between
    stakeholders in the data chain, and those responsible for upholding the rights
    of children, globally.

  abstract: Can today's city govern well if its citizens lack modern technology? How
    important is access to computers for lowering unemployment? What infrastructure
    does a city have to build in order to attract new business? Michael A. Pagano
    curates engagement with such questions by public intellectuals, academics, policy
    analysts, and citizens. Each essay explores the impact and opportunities technology
    provides in government and citizenship, health care, workforce development, service
    delivery to citizens, and metropolitan growth. As the authors show, rapidly emerging
    technologies and access to such technologies shape the ways people and institutions
    interact in the public sphere and private marketplace. The direction of metropolitan
    growth and development, in turn, depends on access to appropriate technology scaled
    and informed by the individual, household, and community needs of the region.

  abstract: 'Participation is a concept and practice that governs many aspects of
    new media and new publics. There are a wide range of attempts to create more of
    it and a surprising lack of theorization. In this paper I attempt to present a
    “grammar” of participation by looking at three cases where participation has been
    central in the contemporary moment of new, social media and the Internet as well
    as in the past, stretching back to the 1930s: citizen participation in public
    administration, workplace participation, and participatory international development.
    Across these three cases I demonstrate that the grammar of participation shifts
    from a language of normative enthusiasm to one of critiques of co-optation and
    bureaucratization and back again. I suggest that this perpetually aspirational
    logic results in the problem of “too much democracy in all the wrong places.”'

  abstract: |-
    Citizen engagement in the Netherlands is formalised at both national and local levels. The legal avenues for citizen engagement at the national level consist primarily of agenda-setting and advisory direct voting mechanisms such as citizen petitions and referenda. At the local level, citizens have a more diverse array of opportunities to engage in policy development. Yet, the availability of these opportunities depends on local administrative arrangements and as such it varies from place to place.

    This report aims at providing an overview of the normative and institutional state of art of ICT-mediated citizen participation in the Netherlands. The first section provides an overview of the political and civic liberties framework in the Netherlands. In the second section the landscape of ICT mediated citizen engagement is mapped. In the third section, the report engages with the implications of technology mediations for deliberative democracy and transformative citizenship.

  abstract: |-
    Data is often referred to as the 'new oil' - the 21st century raw material which, when hitched to algorithmic refinement, may be mined for insight and value - and 'data flows' are said to have exerted a greater impact upon global growth than traditional goods flows in recent years (Manyika et al, 2016). Small wonder, then, that governments around the world are endeavouring to strike a balance between individual privacy rights and protections on the one hand, and organizational permissions to facilitate the creation of social, economic and environmental value from broad-ranging data on the other hand: 'data rights' are now of critical importance courtesy of technological advancements. The tension between the two between the two is particularly evidence where health and care data in the UK is concerned. Individuals are broadly content with anonymized data from their medical records being used for public benefit but are, understandably, anxious about the implications of the most intimate aspects of their lives being hacked or, else, shared without their knowledge or consent.

    This report recommends additional support for digitization efforts in social care settings. They call upon the government to streamline processes associated with Information Governance (IG) modelling to help data sharing initiatives that traverse organizational boundaries. They also advocate for investment and additional legal safeguards to make more anonymized data shets available for research and innovation. Crucially, we recommend expediting the scope for individuals to contribute health and care data to sharing initiatives led by the public sector through promotion, education and pilot activities - so that data is deployed to transform public health and support the 'pivot to prevention.'
