  abstract: Today, governments release governmental data that were previously hidden
    to the public. This democratization of governmental open data (OD) aims to increase
    transparency but also fuels innovation. Indeed, the release of governmental OD
    is a global trend, which has evolved into governmental open innovation (GOI).
    In GOI, governmental actors purposively manage the knowledge flows that span organizational
    boundaries and reveal innovation-related knowledge to the public with the aim
    to spur innovation for a higher economic and social welfare at regional, national,
    or global scale. GOI subsumes different revealing strategies, namely governmental
    OD, problem, and solution revealing. This chapter introduces the concept of GOI
    that has evolved from global OD efforts. It present a historical analysis of the
    emergence of GOI in four different continents, namely, Europe (UK and Denmark),
    North America (United States and Mexico), Australia, and China to highlight the
    emergence of GOI at a global scale.

  abstract: "This report is the second in a series of annual studies and explores
    the level of Open Data Maturity in\nthe EU28 and Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein
    – referred to as EU28+. The measurement is built\non two key indicators Open Data
    Readiness and Portal Maturity, thereby covering the level of\ndevelopment of national
    activities promoting Open Data as well as the level of development of national\nportals.\nIn
    2016, with a 28.6% increase compared to 2015, the EU28+ countries completed over
    55% of their\nOpen Data journey showing that, by 2016, a majority of the EU28+
    countries have successfully\ndeveloped a basic approach to address Open Data.
    The Portal Maturity level increased by 22.6\npercentage points from 41.7% to 64.3%
    thanks to the development of more advanced features on\ncountry data portals.
    The overall Open Data Maturity groups countries into different clusters:\nBeginners,
    Followers, Fast Trackers and Trend Setters.\nBarriers do remain to move Open Data
    forward. The report concludes on a series of recommendations,\nproviding countries
    with guidance to further improve Open Data maturity. Countries need to raise\nmore
    (political) awareness around Open Data, increase automated processes on their
    portals to\nincrease usability and re-usability of data, and organise more events
    and trainings to support both local\nand national initiatives. "

  abstract: "In conventional wisdom on crowdsourcing, the number of people define
    the crowd and maximizing this number is often assumed to be the goal of any crowdsourcing
    exercise. However, we propose that there are structural characteristics of the
    crowd that might be more important than the sheer number of participants. These
    characteristics include (1) growth rate and its attractiveness to the members,
    (2) the equality among members, (3) the density within provisional boundaries,
    (4) the goal orientation of the crowd, and (5) the \"seriality\" of the interactions
    between members of the crowd. We then propose a typology that may allow managers
    to position their companies’ initiatives among four strategic types: crowd crystals,
    online communities, closed crowd, and open crowd driven innovation. We show that
    incumbent companies may prefer a closed and controlled access to the crowd, limiting
    the potential for gaining results and insights from fully open crowd-driven innovation
    initiatives. Consequently, we argue that the effects on industries and organizations
    by open crowds are still to be explored, possibly via the mechanisms of entrepreneurs
    exploiting open crowds as new entrants, but also for the configuration of industries
    such as, e.g., finance, pharmaceuticals, or even the public sector where the value
    created usually comes from interpretation issues and exploratory problem solving.\n\n"

  abstract: This paper presents the conceptual framework and justification for a “Quantified
    Community” (QC) and a networked experimental environment of neighborhood labs.
    The QC is a fully instrumented urban neighborhood that uses an integrated, expandable,
    and participatory sensor network to support the measurement, integration, and
    analysis of neighborhood conditions, social interactions and behavior, and sustainability
    metrics to support public decision-making. Through a diverse range of sensor and
    automation technologies -- combined with existing data generated through administrative
    records, surveys, social media, and mobile sensors -- information on human, physical,
    and environmental elements can be processed in real-time to better understand
    the interaction and effects of the built environment on human well-being and outcomes.
    The goal is to create an “informatics overlay” that can be incorporated into future
    urban development and planning that supports the benchmarking and evaluation of
    neighborhood conditions, provides a test-bed for measuring the impact of new technologies
    and policies, and responds to the changing needs and preferences of the local
    community.

  abstract: 'Non-official sources of data, big data in particular, are currently attracting
    enormous interest in the world of official statistics. An impressive body of work
    focuses on how different types of big data (telecom data, social media, sensors
    and geospatial data, etc.) can be used to fill specific data gaps, especially
    with regard to the post-2015 agenda and the associated technology challenges.
    This paper focuses on different aspects of big data, but ones that are of crucial
    importance: what are the perspectives of the commercial operations and national
    statistical offices that respectively produce and might use this data; and which
    incentives, business models and protocols are needed to leverage non-official
    data sources within the official statistics community?'

  abstract: New technologies pose new challenges on the protection of privacy and
    they stimulate new debates on the scope of privacy. Such debates usually concern
    the individuals’ right to control the flow of his or her personal information.
    The article however discusses new challenges posed by new technologies in terms
    of their impact on groups and their privacy. Two main challenges are being identified
    in this regard, both having to do with the formation of groups through the involvement
    of algorithms and the lack of civil awareness regarding the consequences of this
    involvement. On the one hand, there is the phenomenon of groups being created
    on the basis of big data without the members of such groups being aware of having
    been assigned and being treated as part of a certain group. Here, the challenge
    concerns the limits of personal law, manifesting with the disability of individuals
    to address possible violations of their right to privacy since they are not aware
    of them. On the other hand, commercially driven Websites influence the way in
    which groups form, grow and communicate when doing this online and they do this
    in such subtle way, that members oftentimes do not take into account this influence.
    This is why one could speak of a kind of domination here, which calls for legal
    regulation. The article presents different approaches addressing and dealing with
    those two challenges, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, a conclusion
    gathers the insights reached by the different approaches discussed and reflects
    on future challenges for further research on group privacy in times of big data.

  abstract: "Data-driven tools and techniques, particularly machine learning methods
    that underpin artificial intelligence, offer promise in improving healthcare systems
    and services. One of the companies aspiring to pioneer these advances is DeepMind
    Technologies Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Google conglomerate, Alphabet
    Inc. In 2016, DeepMind announced its first major health project: a collaboration
    with the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, to assist in the management of
    acute kidney injury. Initially received with great enthusiasm, the collaboration
    has suffered from a lack of clarity and openness, with issues of privacy and power
    emerging as potent challenges as the project has unfolded. Taking the DeepMind-Royal
    Free case study as its pivot, this article draws a number of lessons on the transfer
    of population-derived datasets to large private prospectors, identifying critical
    questions for policy-makers, industry and individuals as healthcare moves into
    an algorithmic age.\n\n"
