  abstract: Big data is ubiquitous but heterogeneous. Big data can be used to tally
    clicks and traffic on web pages, find patterns in stock trades, track consumer
    preferences, identify linguistic correlations in large corpuses of texts. This
    book examines big data not as an undifferentiated whole but contextually, investigating
    the varied challenges posed by big data for health, science, law, commerce, and
    politics. Taken together, the chapters reveal a complex set of problems, practices,
    and policies. The advent of big data methodologies has challenged the theory-driven
    approach to scientific knowledge in favor of a data-driven one. Social media platforms
    and self-tracking tools change the way we see ourselves and others. The collection
    of data by corporations and government threatens privacy while promoting transparency.
    Meanwhile, politicians, policy makers, and ethicists are ill-prepared to deal
    with big data’s ramifications. The contributors look at big data’s effect on individuals
    as it exerts social control through monitoring, mining, and manipulation; big
    data and society, examining both its empowering and its constraining effects;
    big data and science, considering issues of data governance, provenance, reuse,
    and trust; and big data and organizations, discussing data responsibility, “data
    harm,” and decision making.

  abstract: |-
    Urna De Cristal (UDC) is an e-participation platform launched by the presidency of Colombia in 2010. The platform allows citizens to raise queries/concerns to any government department/agency, put in requests for grievance redress with a guarantee of an official response. It also has an e-consultation space where government departments can solicit public opinion for aiding policy development. UDC has Web TV and Internet radio channels, and linkages to social networking and social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google plus, Youtube and Instagram.

    This case study on UDC attempts to address the following questions:
    - what visions of citizen engagement inform UDC?
    - what norms of citizen engagement are legitimated through UDC?
    - has UDC contributed to a cooperative and democratic dialog between state, agencies and citizens?

    The authors analyse interviews with key stakeholders from the government, academia and civil society organisations working on human rights and development, and health on the above mentioned questions. The interviews were assessed in the historical context of Colombian democracy, that has been marked by a continued co-existence of electoral politics with violent in-fighting between groups, representing the traditional elites in power, popular movements excluded from the political arena, and criminal organisations funded by narco-trafficking.

  abstract: "The social and economic shifts of the past few decades have hardened
    the deeply held scepticism and distrust of ‘the establishment’. In an age of historically
    low party membership, party identification, voter volatility, rising abstentionism
    and greater individualism, mainstream parties are struggling to be representative.
    This book is about the turbulent political scene unfolding in Britain and across
    western Europe. It focuses on why large swathes of voters feel that politics does
    not work, how this fuels support for insurgent parties and actors, and it investigates
    the power of democratic innovations. \n\nDrawing on new survey data in the UK,
    as well as interviews and case studies, the book shows that people are concerned
    with the process of politics, not merely its performance, and that they have a
    genuine desire for greater political participation in the decision-making process.
    These new forms of political engagement should not feel like a threat to formal
    systems of government, but as much-needed additions that enrich democracy. "

  abstract: This paper introduces Google Votes, an experiment in liquid democracy
    built on Google's internal corporate Google+ social network. Liquid democracy
    decision-making systems can scale to cover large groups by enabling voters to
    delegate their votes to other voters. This approach is in contrast to direct democracy
    systems where voters vote directly on issues, and representative democracy systems
    where voters elect representatives to vote on issues for them. Liquid democracy
    systems can provide many of the benefits of both direct and representative democracy
    systems with few of the weaknesses. Thus far, high implementation complexity and
    infrastructure costs have prevented widespread adoption. Google Votes demonstrates
    how the use of social-networking technology can overcome these barriers and enable
    practical liquid democracy systems. The case-study of Google Votes usage at Google
    over a 3 year timeframe is included, as well as a framework for evaluating vote
    visibility called the "Golden Rule of Liquid Democracy".

  abstract: First, this book pays attention to the overall impact of the Internet
    and people's use of digital media and new technologies to analyze civic life at
    large, reconceptualizing what citizenship is today. Secondly, and more specifically,
    participants shed light over the intersection of a number of current new agendas
    of research in regards to some of the most rapidly growing technological advances
    (i.e., new publics and citizenship), and the emergence of sprouting structures
    of citizenship. The volume shows the implications that new technological advances
    carry with respect the possibilities, patterns and mechanisms for citizen communication,
    citizen deliberation, public sphere and civic engagement.
