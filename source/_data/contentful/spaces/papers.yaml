  abstract: This timely collection explores trust research from many angles while
    ably demonstrating the potential of cross-discipline collaboration to deepen our
    understanding of institutional trust. Citing, among other things, current breakdowns
    of trust in prominent institutions, the book presents a multilevel model identifying
    universal aspects of trust as well as domain- and context-specific variations
    deserving further study. Contributors analyze similarities and differences in
    trust across public domains from politics and policing to medicine and science,
    and across languages and nations. Innovative strategies for measuring and assessing
    trust also shed new light on this essentially human behavior.

  abstract: 'City logistics proposes an integrated vision of freight transportation

    terms of efficiency, security, safety, viability and environmental sustainability.
    Recently, this perspective has been extended by the Smart City concept in order
    to include other aspects of city management: building, energy, environment, government,
    living, mobility, education, health and so on. At the best of our knowledge, a
    classification of Smart City Projects has not been created yet. This paper introduces
    such a classification, highlighting success factors and analyzing new trends in
    Smart City.'

  abstract: "Improving public health is a major responsibility of any government,
    and is of major interest to citizens and scientific communities around the world.
    Here, one sees two extremes. On one hand, tremendous progress has been made in
    recent years in the understanding of causes, spread and remedies of common and
    regularly occurring diseases like Dengue, Malaria and Japanese Encephalistis (JE).
    On the other hand, public agencies treat these diseases in an ad hoc manner without
    learning from the experiences of previous years. Specifically, they would get
    alerted once reported cases have already arisen substantially in the known disease
    season, reactively initiate a few actions and then document the disease impact
    (cases, deaths) for that period, only to forget this learning in the next season.
    However, they miss the opportunity to reduce preventable deaths and sickness,
    and their corresponding economic impact, which scientific progress could have
    enabled. The gap is universal but very prominent in developing countries like
    India.\n\n \n\nIn this paper, we show that if public agencies provide historical
    disease impact information openly, it can be analyzed with statistical and machine
    learning techniques, correlated with best emerging practices in disease control,
    and simulated in a setting to optimize social benefits to provide timely guidance
    for new disease seasons and regions. We illustrate using open data for mosquito-borne
    communicable diseases; published results in public health on efficacy of Dengue
    control methods and apply it on a simulated typical city for maximal benefits
    with available resources. The exercise helps us further suggest strategies for
    new regions that may be anywhere in the world, how data could be better recorded
    by city agencies and what prevention methods should medical community focus on
    for wider impact."

  abstract: Policy innovation labs are emerging knowledge actors and technical experts
    in the governing of education. The article offers a historical and conceptual
    account of the organisational form of the policy innovation lab. Policy innovation
    labs are characterised by specific methods and techniques of design, data science,
    and digitisation in public services such as education. The second half of the
    article details how labs promote the use of digital data analysis, evidence-based
    evaluation and ‘design-for-policy’ techniques as methods for the governing of
    education. In particular, they promote the ‘computational thinking’ associated
    with computer programming as a capacity required by a ‘reluctant state’ that is
    increasingly concerned to delegate its responsibilities to digitally enabled citizens
    with the ‘designerly’ capacities and technical expertise to ‘code’ solutions to
    public and social problems. Policy innovation labs are experimental laboratories
    trialling new methods within education for administering and governing the future
    of the state itself.

  abstract: This collection presents the stories of our contributors’ experiences
    and insights, in order to demonstrate the enormous potential for openly-licensed
    and accessible datasets (Open Data) to be used as Open Educational Resources (OER).
    Open Data is an umbrella term describing openly-licensed, interoperable, and reusable
    datasets which have been created and made available to the public by national
    or local governments, academic researchers, or other organisations. These datasets
    can be accessed, used and shared without restrictions other than attribution of
    the intellectual property of their creators1.While there are various de nitions
    of OER, these are generally understood as openly-licensed digital resources that
    can be used in teaching and learning2.

  abstract: Many policy-makers are struggling to understand participatory governance
    in the midst of technological changes. Advances in information and communication
    technologies (ICTs) continue to have an impact on the ways that policy-makers
    and citizens engage with each other throughout the policy-making process. A set
    of developments in the areas of opening government data, advanced analytics, visualization,
    simulation, and gaming, and ubiquitous citizen access using mobile and personalized
    applications is shaping the interactions between policy-makers and citizens. Yet
    the impact of these developments on the policy-makers is unclear. The changing
    roles and need for new capabilities required from the government are analyzed
    in this paper using two case studies. Salient new roles for policy-makers are
    outlined focused on orchestrating the policy-making process. Research directions
    are identified including understand the behavior of users, aggregating and analyzing
    content from scattered resources, and the effective use of the new tools. Understanding
    new policy-makers roles will help to bridge the gap between the potential of tools
    and technologies and the organizational realities and political contexts. We argue
    that many examples are available that enable learning from others, in both directions,
    developed countries experiences are useful for developing countries and experiences
    from the latter are valuable for the former countries.

  abstract: |-
    Many of us spend much of our time in meetings and at conferences. But too often these feel like a waste of time, or fail to make the most of the knowledge and experience of the people present.

    Meetings have changed - with much more use of online tools, and a growing range of different meeting formats. But our sense is that meetings could be much better
    run and achieve better results.

    This paper tries to help. It:
    ● summarises some of what's known about how meetings work well or badly;
    ● makes recommendations about how to make meetings better; and
    ● showcases some interesting recent innovations.

    It forms part of a larger research programme at Nesta on collective intelligence which is investigating how groups and organisations can make the most of their brains, and of the technologies they use.

    We hope the paper will be helpful to anyone designing or running meetings of any kind, and that readers will contribute good examples, ideas and evidence which can be added into future versions.

  abstract: 'The Age of Sharing Nicholas A. John Sharing is central to how we live
    today: it is what we do online; it is a model of economic behavior; and it is
    also a type of therapeutic talk. Sharing embodies positive values such as empathy,
    communication, fairness, openness and equality. The Age of Sharing shows how and
    when sharing became caring, and explains how its meanings have changed in the
    digital age.But the word ‘sharing’ also camouflages commercial or even exploitative
    relations. Websites say they share data with advertisers, although in reality
    they sell it, while parts of the sharing economy look a great deal like rental
    services. Ultimately, it is argued, practices described as sharing and critiques
    of those practices have common roots. Consequently, the metaphor of sharing now
    constructs significant swathes of our social practices and provides the grounds
    for critiquing them; it is a mode of participation in the capitalist order as
    well as a way of resisting it.Drawing on nineteenth-century literature, Alcoholics
    Anonymous, the American counterculture, reality TV, hackers, Airbnb, Facebook
    and more, The Age of Sharing offers a rich account of a complex contemporary keyword.
    It will appeal to students and scholars of the Internet, digital culture and linguistics.'

  abstract: |-
    Reasoning is generally seen as a means to improve knowledge and make better decisions. However, much evidence shows that reasoning often leads to epistemic distortions and poor decisions. This suggests that the function of reasoning should be rethought. Our hypothesis is that the function of reasoning is argumentative. It is to devise and evaluate arguments intended to persuade.
    Reasoning so conceived is adaptive given the exceptional dependence of humans on communication and their vulnerability to misinformation. A wide range of evidence in the psychology of reasoning and decision making can be reinterpreted and better explained in the light of this hypothesis. Poor performance in standard reasoning tasks is explained by the lack of argumentative context. When the same problems are placed in a proper argumentative setting, people turn out to be skilled arguers. Skilled
    arguers, however, are not after the truth but after arguments supporting their views. This explains the notorious confirmation bias. This bias is apparent not only when people are actually arguing, but also when they are reasoning proactively from the perspective of having to defend their opinions. Reasoning so motivated can distort evaluations and attitudes and allow erroneous beliefs to persist. Proactively used reasoning also favors decisions that are easy to justify but not necessarily better. In all these instances traditionally described as failures or flaws, reasoning does exactly what can be expected of an argumentative device: Look for arguments that support a given conclusion, and, ceteris paribus, favor conclusions for which arguments can be found.
