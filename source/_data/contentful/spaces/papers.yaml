  abstract: 'This article examines the opportunities presented by effectively harnessing
    big data in the public sector context. The article is exploratory and reviews
    both academic- and practitioner–oriented literature related to big data developments.
    The findings suggest that big data will have an impact on the future role of public
    sector organizations in functional areas. However, the author also reveals that
    there are challenges to be addressed by governments in adopting big data applications.
    To realize the benefits of big data, policy-makers need to: invest in research;
    create incentives for private and public sector entities to share data; and set
    up programmes to develop appropriate skills.'

  abstract: Earthquake early warning (EEW) can reduce harm to people and infrastructure
    from earthquakes and tsunamis, but it has not been implemented in most high earthquake-risk
    regions because of prohibitive cost. Common consumer devices such as smartphones
    contain low-cost versions of the sensors used in EEW. Although less accurate than
    scientific-grade instruments, these sensors are globally ubiquitous. Through controlled
    tests of consumer devices, simulation of an Mw (moment magnitude) 7 earthquake
    on California’s Hayward fault, and real data from the Mw 9 Tohoku-oki earthquake,
    we demonstrate that EEW could be achieved via crowdsourcing.

  abstract: |-
    "Organizations are highly interested in integrative open innovation practices in their structure, as open innovation can bring a flood of creative contributions and problem solving from the public. However, there are significant challenges in successful adoption. One reason for this difficulty stems from conflicting organizational structures; open innovation practices are primarily online, fluid, rapid, iterative, and often temporary, whereas the command and control hierarchical structure of organizations are intended to be stable and to complete sustained services. Another source of this difficulty for administrators who are designing and managing open innovation efforts for the first time. Most administrators in organizations rarely have extensive technological or socio-technical design background or training. Therefore, an entire new skill set is being developed on to use participatory platforms. Even if the design and tech know-how is part of an administrator's toolkit, they may not know how to effectively align the goals, language, and evaluation metrics for successful implementation of participatory efforts. More often than not, administrators are attempting to run an open innovation effort in addition to their other, primary duties. Finally, even though open innovation tools like participatory platforms have existed for several years, there is high fragmentation and silos of working knowledge, meaning that many administrators continue to experiment in de facto isolation.

    This paper presents a case study of a public university that has made a purposeful effort to integrate open innovation values and practices into its organizational mission and work. To best understand the process of open innovation adoption and use, we interviewed administrative intermediaries who are primarily responsible for the design, management, and evaluation of open innovation platforms and programs. We explored intermediary administrators' experiences with open innovation adoption using organizational learning theory. We specifically asked questions along dimensions of design and management values, teamwork, and organizational innovation culture. We used theoretical pattern matching to explore how the experiences of interview respondents aligned with theoretical propositions of organizational learning. Our analysis provides detailed insights one best practices, challenges, and lessons learned in the design and management of participatory platforms within the organization. This study has four key findings to contribute to the management of open innovation practices in organizations. First, the best team and approaches cannot thrive within the right culture. Second, developing culture takes time and consistent and persistent work from administrators throughout the organization. Third, three types of hybridity were identified by intermediaries in the execution of their innovation effort. These include unintentional, segmented, and fluid hybridity arrangements. Fourth, administrative intermediaries can identify what is likely to lead to successful or unsuccessful implementation of open innovation platforms. These findings contribute a foundation about open innovation management that can assist other administrators in organizations seeking to integrate innovation and entrepreneurship practices into their core mission and daily activities.

  abstract: By looking at the nature of data that may be disclosed by governments,
    Harlan Yu and David Robinson provide an analytical framework that evinces the
    ambiguities underlying the term “open government data". While agreeing with their
    core analysis, I contend that the authors ignore the enabling conditions under
    which transparency may lead to accountability, notably the publicity and political
    agency conditions. I argue that the authors also overlook the role of participatory
    mechanisms as an essential element in unlocking the potential for open data to
    produce better governmental decisions and policies. Finally, I conduct an empirical
    analysis of the publicity and political agency conditions in countries that have
    launched open data efforts, highlighting the challenges associated with open data
    as a path to accountability.

  abstract: Social media platforms risk polarising public opinions by employing proprietary
    algorithms that produce filter bubbles and echo chambers. As a result, the ability
    of citizens and communities to engage in robust debate in the public sphere is
    diminished. In response, this paper highlights the capacity of urban interfaces,
    such as pervasive displays, to counteract this trend by exposing citizens to the
    socio-cultural diversity of the city. Engagement with different ideas, networks
    and communities is crucial to both innovation and the functioning of democracy.
    We discuss examples of urban interfaces designed to play a key role in fostering
    this engagement. Based on an analysis of works empirically-grounded in field observations
    and design research, we call for a theoretical framework that positions pervasive
    displays and other urban interfaces as civic media. We argue that when designed
    for more than wayfinding, advertisement or television broadcasts, urban screens
    as civic media can rectify some of the pitfalls of social media by allowing the
    polarised user to break out of their filter bubble and embrace the cultural diversity
    and richness of the city.

  abstract: |-
    Digital technology undoubtedly has huge potential to contribute to the functions of government and public administration, but so far the building of information portals and putting transactions on government web sites have not realised the great expectations for it in terms of “transforming government”. This Working Paper explores why the ambitions for transformational e-government (however it has been labelled) over the last 20 years have not been realised. It provides a critical analysis to offer a diagnosis of the problem and its causes. In the hope of a better future, it develops a structured frame of reference for making sense of how information and communications technologies (ICT), in all their forms, really fit within the world of government and public administration.

    To actually achieve a transformation of government through the use of digital technologies, governments will require a complete reversal of the current way of looking at the challenge. Instead of viewing the problem from the point of view of the internet, they must start with the political process of policy design. In particular, they must look at how technology can change the range and characteristics of policy instruments — the tools that governments choose from to intervene in the economy, society and environment to make change, such as taxes, benefits, licences, information campaigns and more tangible things like public services and infrastructure. These are the practical results of government, and only when technology changes those can we say it has transformed government.

  abstract: 'Due to expected benefits such as citizen participation and innovation,
    the release of Public Sector Information as open data is getting increased attention
    on various levels of government. However, currently data release by governments
    is still novel and there is little experience and knowledge thus far about its
    benefits, costs and barriers. This is compounded by a lack of understanding about
    how internal processes influence data release. Our aim in this paper is to get
    a better understanding of these processes and how they influence data release,
    i.e., to find determinants for the release of public sector information. For this
    purpose, we conducted workshops, interviews, questionnaires, desk research and
    practice based cases in the education program of our university, involving six
    local public sector organizations. We find that the way data is stored, the way
    data is obtained and the way data is used by a department are crucial indicators
    for open data release. We conclude with the lessons learned based on our research
    findings. These findings are: we should take a nuanced approach towards data release,
    avoid releasing data for its own sake, and take small incremental steps to explore
    data release.'

  abstract: The growing participation in social networking sites is altering the nature
    of social relations and changing the nature of political and public dialogue.
    This paper contributes to the current debate on Web 2.0 technologies and their
    implications for local governance, identifying the perceptions of policy makers
    on the use of Web 2.0 in providing public services and on the changing roles that
    could arise from the resulting interaction between local governments and their
    stakeholders. The results obtained suggest that policy makers are willing to implement
    Web 2.0 technologies in providing public services, but preferably under the Bureaucratic
    model framework, thus retaining a leading role in this implementation. The learning
    curve of local governments in the use of Web 2.0 technologies is a factor that
    could influence policy makers’ perceptions. In this respect, many research gaps
    are identified and further study of the question is recommended.

  abstract: 'Explaining individual behavior in politics should rely on the same motivational
    assumptions as explaining behavior in the market: That’s what Political Economy,
    understood as the application of economics to the study of political processes,
    is all about. In its standard variant, those who played the game of politics should
    also be considered rational and self-interested, unlike the benevolent despot
    of earlier models. History repeats itself with the rise of behavioral economics:
    Assuming cognitive biases to be present in the market, but not in politics, behavioral
    economists often call for government to intervene in a “benevolent” way. Recently,
    however, political economists have started to apply behavioral economics insights
    to the study of political processes, thereby re-establishing a unified methodology.
    This paper surveys the current state of the emerging field of “Behavioral Political
    Economy” and considers the scope for further research.'

    supply side, to the usage and dimension of citizen engagement. Citizens have various
    ways to engage in civic political life, with many new forms of engagement facilitated
    by digital technologies. The question is to what extent these forms of engagement
    have any impact on society and the way society is governed. More particularly,
    what forms of engagement have impact, what type of impact is evidenced, is that
    impact positive or negative, in what ways, and for whom? Phrasing the question
    in this way recognizes that citizen engagement can have a range of differing impacts,
    in multifaceted forms, and these impacts may not always be positive for broader
    society.

  abstract: This paper introduces Google Votes, an experiment in liquid democracy
    built on Google's internal corporate Google+ social network. Liquid democracy
    decision-making systems can scale to cover large groups by enabling voters to
    delegate their votes to other voters. This approach is in contrast to direct democracy
    systems where voters vote directly on issues, and representative democracy systems
    where voters elect representatives to vote on issues for them. Liquid democracy
    systems can provide many of the benefits of both direct and representative democracy
    systems with few of the weaknesses. Thus far, high implementation complexity and
    infrastructure costs have prevented widespread adoption. Google Votes demonstrates
    how the use of social-networking technology can overcome these barriers and enable
    practical liquid democracy systems. The case-study of Google Votes usage at Google
    over a 3 year timeframe is included, as well as a framework for evaluating vote
    visibility called the "Golden Rule of Liquid Democracy".

  abstract: Policy innovation labs are emerging knowledge actors and technical experts
    in the governing of education. The article offers a historical and conceptual
    account of the organisational form of the policy innovation lab. Policy innovation
    labs are characterised by specific methods and techniques of design, data science,
    and digitisation in public services such as education. The second half of the
    article details how labs promote the use of digital data analysis, evidence-based
    evaluation and ‘design-for-policy’ techniques as methods for the governing of
    education. In particular, they promote the ‘computational thinking’ associated
    with computer programming as a capacity required by a ‘reluctant state’ that is
    increasingly concerned to delegate its responsibilities to digitally enabled citizens
    with the ‘designerly’ capacities and technical expertise to ‘code’ solutions to
    public and social problems. Policy innovation labs are experimental laboratories
    trialling new methods within education for administering and governing the future
    of the state itself.

  abstract: "Laws and regulations are ubiquitous, touching on many aspects of individual
    and corporate behavior. But under what conditions are laws and rules actually
    effective? A huge amount of recent work in political science, sociology, economics,
    criminology, law, and psychology, among other disciplines, deals with this question.
    But these fields rarely inform one another, leaving the state of research disjointed
    and disorganized. Lawrence M. Friedman finds order in this cacophony. Impact gathers
    recent findings into one overarching analysis and lays the groundwork for a cohesive
    body of work in what Friedman labels “impact studies.”\n \n The first important
    factor that has a bearing on impact is communication. A rule or law has no effect
    if it never reaches its intended audience. The public’s fund of legal knowledge,
    the clarity of the law, and the presence of information brokers all influence
    the flow of information from lawmakers to citizens. After a law is communicated,
    subjects sometimes comply, sometimes resist, and sometimes adjust or evade. Three
    clusters of motives help shape which reaction will prevail: first, rewards and
    punishments; second, peer group influences; and third, issues of conscience, legitimacy,
    and morality. When all of these factors move in the same direction, law can have
    a powerful impact; when they conflict, the outcome is sometimes unpredictable."

  abstract: 'The book comprehensively debunks the myth of a lumbering, bureaucratic
    state versus a dynamic, innovative private sector. In a series of case studies—from
    IT, biotech, nanotech to today’s emerging green tech—Professor Mazzucato shows
    that the opposite is true: the private sector only finds the courage to invest
    after an entrepreneurial state has made the high-risk investments. In an intensely
    researched chapter, she reveals that every technology that makes the iPhone so
    ‘smart’ was government funded: the Internet, GPS, its touch-screen display and
    the voice-activated Siri. Mazzucato also controversially argues that in the history
    of modern capitalism the State has not only fixed market failures, but has also
    actively shaped and created markets. In doing so, it sometimes wins and sometimes
    fails. Yet by not admitting the State’s role in such active risk taking, and pretending
    that the state only cheers on the side-lines while the private sector roars, we
    have ended up creating an ‘innovation system’ whereby the public sector socializes
    risks, while rewards are privatized. The book considers how to change this dysfunctional
    dynamic so that economic growth can be not only ‘smart’ but also ‘inclusive’.'

  abstract: Public policy and management problems have been described as poorly defined,
    messy, squishy, unstructured, intractable, and wicked. In a word, they are complex.
    This book illustrates the development and use of simulation models designed to
    capture some of the complexity inherent in the formulation, management, and implementation
    of policies aimed at addressing such problems. Simulation models have long existed
    at the fringes of policy inquiry but are not yet considered an essential component
    of the policy analyst’s toolkit. However, this situation is likely to change because
    with improvements in computational power and software, simulation is now easier
    to include in the standard repertoire of research tools available for discovery
    and decision support. This volume provides both a conceptual rationale for using
    simulations to inform public policy and a practical introduction to how such models
    might be constructed and employed. The focus of these papers is on the uses of
    simulation to gain understanding and inform policy decisions and action. Techniques
    represented in this volume include Monte Carlo simulation, system dynamics and
    agent based modeling.

  abstract: |-
    In myriad sectors of the U.S. economy, from military technology to medical care, the federal government serves as the single-largest spender. As such, many of the innovations, inventions and discoveries that could propel economic growth in the future also would have a direct and measurable impact on federal spending.

    To offer an incentive to research and development that yields significant taxpayer savings, we propose an “innovation savings program” that would serve as an alternative to the traditional patent system. The program would reward teams or individuals who develop discoveries or technologies that produce federal budget savings. In effect, a portion of those savings would be set aside for the discoverers. To be eligible for these rewards, the researchers and inventors would not receive patents on their discoveries or processes.

    This perpetual, self-funded federal prize system would be based, in part, on the successful False Claims Act and Medicare Recovery Audit programs. Payouts would be administered by an independent or executive agency, verified by the Government Accountability Office and overseen by Congress to ensure fair and effective implementation.

    New technologies developed through this process would be available immediately for generic commercialization, free of royalty fees. This could encourage innovation in sectors where patents and traditional research spending have lagged, while also bringing those innovations to market more quickly and affordably. Prize systems of this type have been in operation in the United States for more than 150 years, in the form of the False Claims Act, and date back to “qui tam” actions from the 13th century, thus predating the patent system by several hundred years.

  abstract: Public  organizations  have  interacted  with  citizens  through increasingly  sophisticated  internet-enabled  technology.  Participatory
    platforms  emerged  from  Web  2.0  technologies  in  the  mid-2000s  as  a governance
    mechanism to  engage  citizens in the process of  effecting  social change.  Although  the  potential  of  platforms  is  recognized,  its  successful
    implementation has faced challenges. To begin to get a handle on how to best design  and  manage  participatory  platforms,  we  conducted  an  exploratory
    participatory  action  research  study  grounded  in  two  events  –  The  Policy
    Challenge and NSF Workshop on Participatory Platforms with a Public Intent. Both
    events  communed  practitioners,  scholars,  and citizen participants with diverse
    experience and expertise conducting and researching platforms. The insights  expressed  through  the
    events  and  follow-up  interviews  and  online survey  informed  our  development  of  a  participatory  platform  lifecycle  and
    design framework to assist designing successful participatory platforms.

    “organization of participation,” the UK government–funded Sciencewise program.
    Sciencewise’s interactions with broader political developments are explored, including
    the emergence of “open policy” as a key policy object in the UK context. The article
    considers what the new imaginary of openness means for institutionalized forms
    of public participation in science policymaking, asking whether this is illustrative
    of a “constitutional moment” in relations between society and science policymaking.

  abstract: 'This study examines participatory budgeting (PB) as an important kind
    of citizen participation in the Dominican Republic (DR) and the implications of
    this recent practice for agency, democracy, and development. PB is a process that
    intends to drive change with specific outcomes: through deliberative decision-making,
    ordinary citizens select well-being- and agency-enhancing projects that ideally
    lead to more local and authentic development. Together with the attainment of
    these tangible outcomes, valuable subjective states may also come about: people
    feel more in charge of their own lives, community groups become more collaborative
    and cooperative, and more and better democracy is fostered. Taking a step forward
    from previous studies that only focus on PB from an urban planning or public finance
    perspective, the overall objective of this study is to provide a deeper understanding
    and assessment of how PB works in the localities under analysis, its association
    with different measures of agency, the characteristics that drive its success
    or failure, and its general impact on the lives of individuals and communities.
    Drawing on normative and policy-based literatures and specifically following an
    agency-oriented capability approach, this study uses a mixed-methods approach
    to analyze interview, survey, and direct observations of PB public assemblies,
    and archival data with respect to the 2013 budget cycle in four DR municipalities.
    A regression analysis finds that participation in and awareness of PB are both
    significantly correlated with individuals reporting higher levels of individual
    and collective agency when compared to non-participants and unaware individuals.
    These measures of agency are contextualized to the municipal budget-planning cycle.
    A process tracing analysis concludes that PB is likely, under certain conditions,
    to increase democratic participation and deliberation. However, due to certain
    democratic deficits, PB in two DR municipalities does not always increase agency,
    group cooperative functioning, and good development. Thus, PB must be analyzed
    on a case-by-case basis because differences in the characteristics of each PB
    assembly may lead to different outcomes. It is finally argued that rather than
    condemning democracy because of the failures of the current PB system, we should
    advance PB''s democracy further by improving it in various ways.'

  abstract: This article examines the emergence of democratic deliberation in a crowdsourced
    law reform process. The empirical context of the study is a crowdsourced legislative
    reform in Finland, initiated by the Finnish government. The findings suggest that
    online exchanges in the crowdsourced process qualify as democratic deliberation
    according to the classical definition. We introduce the term “crowdsourced deliberation”
    to mean an open, asynchronous, depersonalized, and distributed kind of online
    deliberation occurring among self-selected participants in the context of an attempt
    by government or another organization to open up the policymaking or lawmaking
    process. The article helps to characterize the nature of crowdsourced policymaking
    and to understand its possibilities as a practice for implementing open government
    principles. We aim to make a contribution to the literature on crowdsourcing in
    policymaking, participatory and deliberative democracy and, specifically, the
    newly emerging subfield in deliberative democracy that focuses on “deliberative
    systems.”

  abstract: 'This short article argues that an adequate response to the implications
    for governance raised by ‘Big Data’ requires much more attention to agency and
    reflexivity than theories of ‘algorithmic power’ have so far allowed. It develops
    this through two contrasting examples: the sociological study of social actors
    used of analytics to meet their own social ends (for example, by community organisations)
    and the study of actors’ attempts to build an economy of information more open
    to civic intervention than the existing one (for example, in the environmental
    sphere). The article concludes with a consideration of the broader norms that

    in terms of the notion of voice, although the practical implementation of voice
    as a norm means that voice must sometimes be considered via the notion of transparency.'

    Introduction: People’s online activities can yield clues about their emerging health conditions. We performed an intensive study to explore the feasibility of using anonymized Web query logs to screen for the emergence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The methods used statistical analyses of large-scale anonymized search logs considering the symptom queries from millions of people, with the potential application of warning individual searchers about the value of seeking attention from health care professionals.

    Methods: We identified searchers in logs of online search activity who issued special queries that are suggestive of a recent diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We then went back many months before these landmark queries were made, to examine patterns of symptoms, which were expressed as searches about concerning symptoms. We built statistical classifiers that predicted the future appearance of the landmark queries based on patterns of signals seen in search logs.

    Results: We found that signals about patterns of queries in search logs can predict the future appearance of queries that are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We showed specifically that we can identify 5% to 15% of cases, while preserving extremely low false-positive rates (0.00001 to 0.0001).

    Conclusion: Signals in search logs show the possibilities of predicting a forthcoming diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma from combinations of subtle temporal signals revealed in the queries of searchers.

    In recent years, a diverse coalition of actors has pushed the creation and diffusion of open data programmes around the world. Governments, international organizations, businesses, academics, media, civil society organizations, and web developers have embraced and sponsored open data programs creating large expectations a suitable remedy for challenges of good governance, economic growth, social inclusion, innovation, and participation.

    Though in many cases this may be true, there is a need for a critical perspective on whether the outcomes indeed occur and under what circumstances. There is a widespread lack of empirical evidence underlying the implementation of Open Data initiative and that can guide better practice and policy formulation, particularly as it spreads to developing countries. Thus, this initial consultation explored substantive and procedural options for the implementation of a research agenda aimed at better understanding the impact of open data.

    This meeting brought together 20 renowned policy-oriented academics coming from diverse geographical areas and backgrounds in order to discuss an interdisciplinary research agenda on the impact of Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives under political, economic and social dimensions. The meeting included a debate on potential research questions and approaches that could inform an international research network on the impact of Open Government Data (OGD) in developing countries.

    The participants also expressed the commitment to the further development of the research agenda and demonstrated their interest in participate in a research network in different forms. They added a number of considerations and contributions for the development of a research network that would address these challenges.

    analysis and evaluation of smart city initiatives. The term “smart city” is now
    generally used to represent efforts that in different ways describe a comprehensive
    vision of a city for the present and future. A smarter city infuses information
    into its physical infrastructure to improve conveniences, facilitate mobility,
    add efficiencies, conserve energy, improve the quality of air and water, identify
    problems and fix them quickly, recover rapidly from disasters, collect data to
    make better decisions, deploy resources effectively and share data to enable collaboration
    across entities and domains. These and other similar efforts are expected to make
    cities more intelligent in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, productivity, transparency,
    and sustainability, among other important aspects. Given this changing social,
    institutional and technology environment, it seems feasible and likeable to attain
    smarter cities and by extension, smarter governments: virtually integrated, networked,
    interconnected, responsive, and efficient. This book will help build the bridge
    between sound research and practice expertise in the area of smarter cities and
    will be of interest to researchers and students in the e-government, public administration,
    political science, communication, information science, administrative sciences
    and management, sociology, computer science, and information technology. As well
    as government officials and public managers who will find practical recommendations
    based on rigorous studies that will contain insights and guidance for the development,
    management, and evaluation of complex smart cities and smart government initiatives.​"

  abstract: The digital exhaust left by flows of physical and digital commodities
    provides a rich measure of the nature, strength and significance of relationships
    between countries in the global network. With this work, we examine how these
    traces and the network structure can reveal the socioeconomic profile of different
    countries. We take into account multiple international networks of physical and
    digital flows, including the previously unexplored international postal network.
    By measuring the position of each country in the Trade, Postal, Migration, International
    Flights, IP and Digital Communications networks, we are able to build proxies
    for a number of crucial socioeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita and the
    Human Development Index ranking along with twelve other indicators used as benchmarks
    of national well-being by the United Nations and other international organisations.
    In this context, we have also proposed and evaluated a global connectivity degree
    measure applying multiplex theory across the six networks that accounts for the
    strength of relationships between countries. We conclude by showing how countries
    with shared community membership over multiple networks have similar socioeconomic
    profiles. Combining multiple flow data sources can help understand the forces
    which drive economic activity on a global level. Such an ability to infer proxy
    indicators in a context of incomplete information is extremely timely in light
    of recent discussions on measurement of indicators relevant to the Sustainable
    Development Goals.

  abstract: Municipal staff and politicians are moving aside to let someone else make
    budget decisions – community residents. This practice, known as participatory
    budgeting or PB, is a completely different way of managing public money. It allows
    the public to both identify projects and programs that they want to see in their
    neighbourhoods, and to vote on which ones to fund. The process was developed twenty-five
    years ago and there are now over 1,500 participatory budgets around the world.

  abstract: |-
    With cities growing rapidly throughout much of the developing world, the global development community increasingly recognizes the need to build the capacities of local leaders to analyze and apply data to improve urban policymaking and service delivery. Civil society leaders, development advocates, and local governments are calling for an “urban data revolution” to accompany the new UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a revolution that would provide city leaders new tools and resources for data-driven governance. The need for improved data and analytic capacity in rapidly growing cities is clear, as is the exponential increase in the volume and types of data available for policymaking. However, the institutional arrangements that will allow city leaders to use data effectively remain incompletely theorized and poorly articulated.

    This paper begins to fill that gap with a political economy framework that introduces three new concepts: permission, incentive, and institutionalization. We argue that without addressing the permission constraints and competing incentives that local government officials face in using data, investments in improved data collection at the local level will fail to achieve smarter urban policies. Granting permission and aligning incentives are also necessary to institutionalize data-driven governance at the local level and create a culture of evidence-based decisionmaking that outlives individual political administrations. Lastly, we suggest how the SDGs could support a truly transformative urban data revolution in which city leaders are empowered and incentivized to use data to drive decisionmaking for sustainable development.

    A national administration is dependent on its archives and registers, for many purposes, such as tax collection, enforcement of law, economic governance, and welfare services. Today, these services are based on large digital infrastructures, which grow organically in volume and scope. Building on a critical realist approach we investigate a particularly successful infrastructure in Norway called Altinn, and ask: what are the evolutionary mechanisms for a successful “government as a platform”?

    We frame our study with two perspectives; a historical institutional perspective that traces the roots of Altinn back to the Middle Ages, and an architectural perspective that allows for a more detailed analysis of the consequences of digitalization and the role of platforms. We offer two insights from our study: we identify three evolutionary mechanisms of national registers, and we discuss a future scenario of government platforms as “digital commons”.

    This report examines patient organisations’ ever more critical role as knowledge brokers in an increasingly complex, data-rich healthcare system.
    Key findings

    Patient organisations are important examples of collective intelligence practiced in challenging conditions with the aim of tackling complex problems.
    With more long term conditions and multimorbidities, more data, more available options in diagnostics, treatments, and care, knowledge is becoming one of the most critical assets of patients seeking optimal care.
    Patient organisations, working as collectives, are in an excellent position to support the work of translating, assembling and analysing the information involved in healthcare.
    Innovative patient organisations are already supporting the development of peer relationships, driving ambitious research programmes, sharing skills and unlocking the energy and expertise of patients. But they need support from better tools to extend this critical work.
    Unlike many popular examples of collective intelligence such as open source software, people coming to patient organisations are not motivated by pre-existing technical skills, but by urgent personal needs. This makes them a hugely productive site of research.

    The ‘thinking challenges’ patients face are enormous and complex, involving an ever-growing store of medical information, the practical and bureaucratic skills of living with a condition. Many go beyond adherence to understanding and partaking in research.

    The health care system is under strain from increasing demand and resource pressure. The NHS and other healthcare networks have committed to engage and empower patients and support them in developing expertise, enabling them to take a more active role in their own care. But knowledge tools and systems that engage only with individuals tend to exacerbate existing health care divides. Health knowledge work is hard, and requires time and resources.

    In this report we argue that patient organisations have a pivotal role to play in distributing the burden and benefit of knowledge work amongst participants. They need new and better tools to support their work developing connections between the many individuals and institutions of the healthcare system, driving ambitious research programmes, and facilitating peer support.

  abstract: Respect for privacy and the individual’s right to control their own data
    is becoming a key competitive parameter. Companies, organisations and authorities
    that treat data ethics as a social responsibility as important as environmental
    awareness and respect for human rights are tomorrow’s winners. Digital trust is
    paramount for digital growth and welfare. This book combines broad trend analysis
    with case studies of companies working with data ethics to varying degrees. The
    authors make the case how citizens and consumers are no longer just concerned
    about their lack of control over data, but also have begun to act, and how alternative
    business models, advances in technology and a new European data protection regulation
    combined foster a growing market for data ethical products and services. It provides
    a critical and fresh look at tech trends and the ethical dilemmas intertwined
    with them. It is a book for responsible players on how to get started with data
    ethics and how to use it to develop digital trust. The book is supported by Internet
    Society (isoc.org).

  abstract: Participation in discussions about the public interest can be enhanced
    by technology, but can also create an environment in which participants are overwhelmed
    by the quantity, quality, and diversity of information and arguments. Political
    participation is at a greater disadvantage than non-political activities in that
    participants from different parties already start out with established differences,
    which requires them to reach some form of common ground before progress can be
    made. Those seeking authentic deliberation are discouraged to participate when
    confronted with uncivil and inflammatory rhetoric. These issues are often exacerbated
    in online discussions, where lack of identity cues and low barriers to entry can
    lead to heightened incivility between participants, often labeled as “flaming”
    and “trolling”. This paper explores the extent to which moderator systems, tools
    online discussion forums use to manage contributions, can reduce information overload
    and encourage civil conversations in virtual discussion spaces. Using the popular
    website Slashdot as an example of sound moderation in a public discourse setting,
    we found that users move toward consensus about which and how comments deserve
    to be moderated. Using these findings, we explore how transferable these systems
    are for participation in public matters specifically to the unique attributes
    of political discussion. Slashdot's political forum provides a comparison group
    that allowed us to find quantitative and qualitative differences in political
    posting, comments, and moderation. Our results show that large scale, civil participation
    is possible with a distributed moderation system that enables regularly lively
    debates to be conducted positively because the system provides tools for people
    to enforce norms of civility.

  abstract: This timely collection explores trust research from many angles while
    ably demonstrating the potential of cross-discipline collaboration to deepen our
    understanding of institutional trust. Citing, among other things, current breakdowns
    of trust in prominent institutions, the book presents a multilevel model identifying
    universal aspects of trust as well as domain- and context-specific variations
    deserving further study. Contributors analyze similarities and differences in
    trust across public domains from politics and policing to medicine and science,
    and across languages and nations. Innovative strategies for measuring and assessing
    trust also shed new light on this essentially human behavior.

  abstract: Natural disasters affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide every
    year. Emergency response efforts depend upon the availability of timely information,
    such as information concerning the movements of affected populations. The analysis
    of aggregated and anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) captured from the mobile
    phone infrastructure provides new possibilities to characterize human behavior
    during critical events. In this work, we investigate the viability of using CDR
    data combined with other sources of information to characterize the floods that
    occurred in Tabasco, Mexico in 2009. An impact map has been reconstructed using
    Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within this frame, the underlying communication
    activity signals in the CDR data have been analyzed and compared against rainfall
    levels extracted from data of the NASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number
    of active phones connected to each cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns
    in the most affected locations during and after the floods that could be used
    as signatures of the floods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment
    and population information awareness. The representativeness of the analysis has
    been assessed using census data and civil protection records. While a more extensive
    validation is required, these early results suggest high potential in using cell
    tower activity information to improve early warning and emergency management mechanisms.

  abstract: To understand how significant the open data movement is for FOIA, this
    Essay discusses the impact of open data on the institutions and functions of government
    and the ways open data contrasts markedly with FOIA. Open data emphasizes the
    proactive publication of whole classes of information. Open data includes data
    about the workings of government but also data collected by the government about
    the economy and society posted online in a centralized repository for use by the
    wider public, including academic users seeking information as the basis for original
    research and commercial users looking to create new products and services. For
    example, Pixar used open data from the United States Geological Survey to create
    more realistic detail in scenes from its movie The Good Dinosaur.

  abstract: "In February 2016, Wellcome Trust organized a pledge among leading scientific
    organizations and health agencies encouraging researchers to release data relevant
    to the Zika outbreak as rapidly and widely as possible [1]. This initiative echoed
    a September 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) consultation that assessed data
    sharing during the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak and called on researchers
    to make data publicly available during public health emergencies [2]. These statements
    were necessary because the traditional way of communicating research results—publication
    in peer-reviewed journals, often months or years after data collection—is too
    slow during an emergency.\n \n The acute health threat of outbreaks provides a
    strong argument for more complete, quick, and broad sharing of research data during
    emergencies. But the Ebola and Zika outbreaks suggest that data sharing cannot
    be limited to emergencies without compromising emergency preparedness. To prepare
    for future outbreaks, the scientific community should expand data sharing for
    all health research."

  abstract: The process of political decision making is often complex and tedious.
    The policy process consists of multiple steps, most of them are highly iterative.
    In addition, different stakeholder groups are involved in political decision making
    and contribute to the process. A series of textual documents accompanies the process.
    Examples are official documents, discussions, scientific reports, external reviews,
    newspaper articles, or economic white papers. Experts from the political domain
    report that this plethora of textual documents often exceeds their ability to
    keep track of the entire policy process. We present PolicyLine, a visualization
    system that supports different stakeholder groups in overview-and-detail tasks
    for large sets of textual documents in the political decision making process.
    In a longitudinal design study conducted together with domain experts in political
    decision making, we identified missing analytical functionality on the basis of
    a problem and domain characterization. In an iterative design phase, we created
    PolicyLine in close collaboration with the domain experts. Finally, we present
    the results of three evaluation rounds, and reflect on our collaborative visualization
    system.

  abstract: Movements towards open data involve the publication of datasets (from
    metadata on publications, to research, to operational project statistics) online
    in standard formats and without restrictions on reuse. A number of open datasets
    are published as linked data, creating a web of connected datasets. Governments,
    companies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) across the world are increasingly
    exploring how the publication and use of open and linked data can have impacts
    on governance, economic growth and the delivery of services. This article outlines
    the historical, social and technical trajectories that have led to current interest
    in, and practices around, open data. Drawing on three example cases of working
    with open and linked data it takes a critical look at issues that development
    sector knowledge intermediaries may need to engage with to ensure the socio-technical
    innovations of open and linked data work in the interests of greater diversity
    and better development practice.

  abstract: 'Open government initiatives, which include not only transparency but
    also participation and collaboration policies, have become a major administrative
    reform. As such, these initiatives are gaining cohesiveness in literature. President
    Obama supported open government through a range of policies including the Open
    Government Partnership (OGP), a multinational initiative. The OGP requires member
    organizations to develop open government national action plans, which are used
    as the basis for my analysis. To frame this paper, I use and expand upon David
    Heald’s directions and varieties of transparency framework. A content analysis
    of the 62 commitments in the US Second Open Government National Action Plan was
    conducted. The analysis provides two findings of note: First, the traditional
    view of transparency was indeed the most prevalent in the policies proposed. In
    that respect, not much has changed, even with the OGP’s emphasis on a range moof
    approaches. Second, openness among and between agencies played a larger than expected
    role. While the OGP pushed an array of administrative reforms, the initiative
    had limited impact on the type of policies that were proposed and enacted. In
    sum, the OGP is an administrative reform that was launched with great fanfare,
    but limited influence in the US context. More research needs to be conducted to
    determine is the “open government reform” movement as a whole suffers from such
    problems in implementation.'

  abstract: "This GovLab Working Paper is an attempt to describe the promise and challenge
    of evaluating new practices of\nproblem solving in governance, specifically citizen-engagement
    interventions. The purpose is to inform those innovators\nwho are eager to develop
    a deeper insight into what works for the key steps, opportunities and challenges\ninvolved
    when assessing impact. In addition, the paper aims to develop a foundation for
    further interdisciplinary\nresearch and debate.\nThis paper summarizes the recent
    lessons learned in the field of evaluation and examines how new methods could\nhelp
    assess the impacts of participatory governance and emerging social technologies
    used in governance. This\nwork is not meant to be a comprehensive review of current
    approaches to evaluating new governance initiatives\nbut is intended to frame
    the issues involved, and suggest where work needs to be done to develop better
    assessments.\nWe are also providing an annotated and open bibliography for further
    reading, inviting others to expand\nupon it. "

  abstract: Uganda has democratic deficits where demand for democracy exceeds its
    supply. As a consequence it is argued that a segment of Ugandans might participate
    and honour the freedom to speak out, assemble, and associate given new opportunities
    outside the traditional political channels. With expanded mobile coverage and
    access to mobile devices and services in mind, and using the concept of open crowdsourcing,
    the platform UgandaWatch was launched prior to the 2011 general elections with
    the intention to meet the demand, to offer increased equality of political participation,
    and to advance efforts toward increased citizen engagement in Uganda. From a community
    informatics point of view, the study examined how and under what conditions access
    to ICT tools (mobile devices, networks, and a crowdsourcing platform) can be made
    usable and useful for people and communities for increased political participation
    in a given context. By combining the collection and analysis of quantitative (SMS-survey)
    and qualitative data (focus groups) through a mixed-method approach, this study
    answers the questions, What are the key factors that influence users’ willingness
    to use mobile phones and crowdsourcing platforms as a channel for political participation?,
    and What concerns do users have with respect to using mobile phones and crowdsourcing
    platforms in the participation process? The study shows that users participated
    because they hoped it would bring real change to Uganda’s electoral and political
    landscape, that it was a convenient channel to use (quick and easy) and that confidentiality
    was assured. The user concerns relate to costs, trust, and safety. Crowdsourcing
    offers an alternative channel and may substitute or supplement traditional means
    of political participation. It can increase participation in some groups, including
    among those who normally do not participate—something that increases equality
    of political participation in a positive direction.

  abstract: The overflow of information generated during disasters can be as paralyzing
    to humanitarian response as the lack of information. Making sense of this information--Big
    Data--is proving an impossible challenge for traditional humanitarian organizations,
    which is precisely why they're turning to Digital Humanitarians. This new humanitarians
    mobilize online to make sense of vast volumes of data--social media and text messages;
    satellite and aerial imagery--in direct support of relief efforts worldwide. How?
    They craft ingenious crowdsourcing solutions with trail-blazing insights from
    artificial intelligence. This book charts the spectacular rise of Digital Humanitarians,
    highlighting how their humanity coupled with innovative Big Data solutions is
    changing humanitarian relief for forever.

  abstract: 'Terrorism, cyberbullying, child pornography, hate speech, cybercrime:
    along with unprecedented advancements in productivity and engagement, the Internet
    has ushered in a space for violent, hateful, and antisocial behavior. How do we,
    as individuals and as a society, protect against dangerous expressions online?
    Confronting the Internet''s Dark Side is the first book on social responsibility
    on the Internet. It aims to strike a balance between the free speech principle
    and the responsibilities of the individual, corporation, state, and the international
    community. This book brings a global perspective to the analysis of some of the
    most troubling uses of the Internet. It urges net users, ISPs, and liberal democracies
    to weigh freedom and security, finding the golden mean between unlimited license
    and moral responsibility. This judgment is necessary to uphold the very liberal
    democratic values that gave rise to the Internet and that are threatened by an
    unbridled use of technology.'
