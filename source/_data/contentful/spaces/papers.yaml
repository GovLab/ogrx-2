  abstract: This article examines the emergence of democratic deliberation in a crowdsourced
    law reform process. The empirical context of the study is a crowdsourced legislative
    reform in Finland, initiated by the Finnish government. The findings suggest that
    online exchanges in the crowdsourced process qualify as democratic deliberation
    according to the classical definition. We introduce the term “crowdsourced deliberation”
    to mean an open, asynchronous, depersonalized, and distributed kind of online
    deliberation occurring among self-selected participants in the context of an attempt
    by government or another organization to open up the policymaking or lawmaking
    process. The article helps to characterize the nature of crowdsourced policymaking
    and to understand its possibilities as a practice for implementing open government
    principles. We aim to make a contribution to the literature on crowdsourcing in
    policymaking, participatory and deliberative democracy and, specifically, the
    newly emerging subfield in deliberative democracy that focuses on “deliberative
    systems.”

  abstract: Earthquake early warning (EEW) can reduce harm to people and infrastructure
    from earthquakes and tsunamis, but it has not been implemented in most high earthquake-risk
    regions because of prohibitive cost. Common consumer devices such as smartphones
    contain low-cost versions of the sensors used in EEW. Although less accurate than
    scientific-grade instruments, these sensors are globally ubiquitous. Through controlled
    tests of consumer devices, simulation of an Mw (moment magnitude) 7 earthquake
    on California’s Hayward fault, and real data from the Mw 9 Tohoku-oki earthquake,
    we demonstrate that EEW could be achieved via crowdsourcing.

  abstract: 'This short article argues that an adequate response to the implications
    for governance raised by ‘Big Data’ requires much more attention to agency and
    reflexivity than theories of ‘algorithmic power’ have so far allowed. It develops
    this through two contrasting examples: the sociological study of social actors
    used of analytics to meet their own social ends (for example, by community organisations)
    and the study of actors’ attempts to build an economy of information more open
    to civic intervention than the existing one (for example, in the environmental
    sphere). The article concludes with a consideration of the broader norms that
    might contextualise these empirical studies, and proposes that they can be understood
    in terms of the notion of voice, although the practical implementation of voice
    as a norm means that voice must sometimes be considered via the notion of transparency.'

  abstract: |-
    Introduction: People’s online activities can yield clues about their emerging health conditions. We performed an intensive study to explore the feasibility of using anonymized Web query logs to screen for the emergence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The methods used statistical analyses of large-scale anonymized search logs considering the symptom queries from millions of people, with the potential application of warning individual searchers about the value of seeking attention from health care professionals.

    Methods: We identified searchers in logs of online search activity who issued special queries that are suggestive of a recent diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We then went back many months before these landmark queries were made, to examine patterns of symptoms, which were expressed as searches about concerning symptoms. We built statistical classifiers that predicted the future appearance of the landmark queries based on patterns of signals seen in search logs.

    Results: We found that signals about patterns of queries in search logs can predict the future appearance of queries that are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We showed specifically that we can identify 5% to 15% of cases, while preserving extremely low false-positive rates (0.00001 to 0.0001).

    Conclusion: Signals in search logs show the possibilities of predicting a forthcoming diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma from combinations of subtle temporal signals revealed in the queries of searchers.

  abstract: 'The book comprehensively debunks the myth of a lumbering, bureaucratic
    state versus a dynamic, innovative private sector. In a series of case studies—from
    IT, biotech, nanotech to today’s emerging green tech—Professor Mazzucato shows
    that the opposite is true: the private sector only finds the courage to invest
    after an entrepreneurial state has made the high-risk investments. In an intensely
    researched chapter, she reveals that every technology that makes the iPhone so
    ‘smart’ was government funded: the Internet, GPS, its touch-screen display and
    the voice-activated Siri. Mazzucato also controversially argues that in the history
    of modern capitalism the State has not only fixed market failures, but has also
    actively shaped and created markets. In doing so, it sometimes wins and sometimes
    fails. Yet by not admitting the State’s role in such active risk taking, and pretending
    that the state only cheers on the side-lines while the private sector roars, we
    have ended up creating an ‘innovation system’ whereby the public sector socializes
    risks, while rewards are privatized. The book considers how to change this dysfunctional
    dynamic so that economic growth can be not only ‘smart’ but also ‘inclusive’.'

  abstract: Public policy and management problems have been described as poorly defined,
    messy, squishy, unstructured, intractable, and wicked. In a word, they are complex.
    This book illustrates the development and use of simulation models designed to
    capture some of the complexity inherent in the formulation, management, and implementation
    of policies aimed at addressing such problems. Simulation models have long existed
    at the fringes of policy inquiry but are not yet considered an essential component
    of the policy analyst’s toolkit. However, this situation is likely to change because
    with improvements in computational power and software, simulation is now easier
    to include in the standard repertoire of research tools available for discovery
    and decision support. This volume provides both a conceptual rationale for using
    simulations to inform public policy and a practical introduction to how such models
    might be constructed and employed. The focus of these papers is on the uses of
    simulation to gain understanding and inform policy decisions and action. Techniques
    represented in this volume include Monte Carlo simulation, system dynamics and
    agent based modeling.

  abstract: |-
    In myriad sectors of the U.S. economy, from military technology to medical care, the federal government serves as the single-largest spender. As such, many of the innovations, inventions and discoveries that could propel economic growth in the future also would have a direct and measurable impact on federal spending.

    To offer an incentive to research and development that yields significant taxpayer savings, we propose an “innovation savings program” that would serve as an alternative to the traditional patent system. The program would reward teams or individuals who develop discoveries or technologies that produce federal budget savings. In effect, a portion of those savings would be set aside for the discoverers. To be eligible for these rewards, the researchers and inventors would not receive patents on their discoveries or processes.

    This perpetual, self-funded federal prize system would be based, in part, on the successful False Claims Act and Medicare Recovery Audit programs. Payouts would be administered by an independent or executive agency, verified by the Government Accountability Office and overseen by Congress to ensure fair and effective implementation.

    New technologies developed through this process would be available immediately for generic commercialization, free of royalty fees. This could encourage innovation in sectors where patents and traditional research spending have lagged, while also bringing those innovations to market more quickly and affordably. Prize systems of this type have been in operation in the United States for more than 150 years, in the form of the False Claims Act, and date back to “qui tam” actions from the 13th century, thus predating the patent system by several hundred years.

  abstract: Public  organizations  have  interacted  with  citizens  through increasingly  sophisticated  internet-enabled  technology.  Participatory
    platforms  emerged  from  Web  2.0  technologies  in  the  mid-2000s  as  a governance
    mechanism to  engage  citizens in the process of  effecting  social change.  Although  the  potential  of  platforms  is  recognized,  its  successful
    implementation has faced challenges. To begin to get a handle on how to best design  and  manage  participatory  platforms,  we  conducted  an  exploratory
    participatory  action  research  study  grounded  in  two  events  –  The  Policy
    Challenge and NSF Workshop on Participatory Platforms with a Public Intent. Both
    events  communed  practitioners,  scholars,  and citizen participants with diverse
    experience and expertise conducting and researching platforms. The insights  expressed  through  the
    events  and  follow-up  interviews  and  online survey  informed  our  development  of  a  participatory  platform  lifecycle  and
    design framework to assist designing successful participatory platforms.

  abstract: This article builds on work in Science and Technology Studies and cognate
    disciplines concerning the institutionalization of public engagement and participation
    practices. It describes and analyses ethnographic qualitative research into one
    “organization of participation,” the UK government–funded Sciencewise program.
    Sciencewise’s interactions with broader political developments are explored, including
    the emergence of “open policy” as a key policy object in the UK context. The article
    considers what the new imaginary of openness means for institutionalized forms
    of public participation in science policymaking, asking whether this is illustrative
    of a “constitutional moment” in relations between society and science policymaking.

  abstract: 'This study examines participatory budgeting (PB) as an important kind
    of citizen participation in the Dominican Republic (DR) and the implications of
    this recent practice for agency, democracy, and development. PB is a process that
    intends to drive change with specific outcomes: through deliberative decision-making,
    ordinary citizens select well-being- and agency-enhancing projects that ideally
    lead to more local and authentic development. Together with the attainment of
    these tangible outcomes, valuable subjective states may also come about: people
    feel more in charge of their own lives, community groups become more collaborative
    and cooperative, and more and better democracy is fostered. Taking a step forward
    from previous studies that only focus on PB from an urban planning or public finance
    perspective, the overall objective of this study is to provide a deeper understanding
    and assessment of how PB works in the localities under analysis, its association
    with different measures of agency, the characteristics that drive its success
    or failure, and its general impact on the lives of individuals and communities.
    Drawing on normative and policy-based literatures and specifically following an
    agency-oriented capability approach, this study uses a mixed-methods approach
    to analyze interview, survey, and direct observations of PB public assemblies,
    and archival data with respect to the 2013 budget cycle in four DR municipalities.
    A regression analysis finds that participation in and awareness of PB are both
    significantly correlated with individuals reporting higher levels of individual
    and collective agency when compared to non-participants and unaware individuals.
    These measures of agency are contextualized to the municipal budget-planning cycle.
    A process tracing analysis concludes that PB is likely, under certain conditions,
    to increase democratic participation and deliberation. However, due to certain
    democratic deficits, PB in two DR municipalities does not always increase agency,
    group cooperative functioning, and good development. Thus, PB must be analyzed
    on a case-by-case basis because differences in the characteristics of each PB
    assembly may lead to different outcomes. It is finally argued that rather than
    condemning democracy because of the failures of the current PB system, we should
    advance PB''s democracy further by improving it in various ways.'
