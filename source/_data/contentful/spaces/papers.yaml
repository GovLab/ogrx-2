  abstract: |-
    Open government data (OGD) as a concept is gaining currency globally due to the strong advocacy of global organisations as Open Government Partnership. In recent years, there has been increased commitment on the part of national governments to proactively disclose information. However, much of the discussion on OGD is at the national level, especially in developing countries where commitments of proactive disclosure is conditioned by the commitments of national governments as expressed through the OGP national action plans. However, the local is important in the context of open data. In decentralized contexts, the local is where data is collected and stored, where there is strong feasibility that data will be published, and where data can generate the most impact when used. This synthesis paper wants to refocus the discussion of open government data in sub-national contexts by analysing nine country papers produced through the Open Data in Developing Countries research project.

    Using a common research framework that focuses on context, governance setting, and open data initiatives, the study found out that there is substantial effort on the part of sub-national governments to proactively disclose data, however, the design delimits citizen participation, and eventually, use. Second, context demands diff erent roles for intermediaries and diff erent types of initiatives to create an enabling environment for open data. Finally, data quality will remain a critical challenge for sub-national governments in developing countries and it will temper potential impact that open data will be able to generate.

  abstract: |-
    Social media are now widely used for political protests, campaigns, and communication in developed and developing nations, but available research has not yet paid sufficient attention to experiences beyond the US and UK. This collection tackles this imbalance head-on, compiling cutting-edge research across six continents to provide a comprehensive, global, up-to-date review of recent political uses of social media.

    Drawing together empirical analyses of the use of social media by political movements and in national and regional elections and referenda, The Routledge Companion to Social Media and Politics presents studies ranging from Anonymous and the Arab Spring to the Greek Aganaktismenoi, and from South Korean presidential elections to the Scottish independence referendum. The book is framed by a selection of keystone theoretical contributions, evaluating and updating existing frameworks for the social media age.

  abstract: |-
    This book critically explores forms and techniques of calculation that emerge with digital computation, and their implications. The contributors demonstrate that digital calculative devices matter beyond their specific functions as they progressively shape, transform and govern all areas of our life. In particular, it addresses such questions as:

    -How does the drive to make sense of, and productively use, large amounts of diverse data, inform the development of new calculative devices, logics and techniques?
    -How do these devices, logics and techniques affect our capacity to decide and to act?
    -How do mundane elements of our physical and virtual existence become data to be analysed and rearranged in complex ensembles of people and things?
    -In what ways are conventional notions of public and private, individual and population, certainty and probability, rule and exception transformed and what are the consequences?
    -How does the search for ‘hidden’ connections and patterns change our understanding of social relations and associative life?
    -Do contemporary modes of calculation produce new thresholds of calculability and computability, allowing for the improbable or the merely possible to be embraced and acted upon?
    -As contemporary approaches to governing uncertain futures seek to anticipate future events, how are calculation and decision engaged anew?

    Drawing together different strands of cutting-edge research that is both theoretically sophisticated and empirically rich, this book makes an important contribution to several areas of scholarship, including the emerging social science field of software studies, and will be a vital resource for students and scholars alike.

    Governments around the world are looking for ways to nurture innovative businesses, as a way of solving some of their most urgent economic and societal challenges. Many seek to do this by setting up national innovation agencies: institutions that provide financial and other support to catalyse or drive private sector innovation. Yet we still know relatively little about the range of approaches that these agencies take, what programmes and instruments are likely to work best in a given context, and how to assess their long-term impact.

    We have been investigating these questions by studying a diverse group selection of innovation agencies in ten different countries. Our aim has been to improve understanding of the range of existing institutional models and to learn more about their design, evolution and effectiveness. In doing so, we have developed a broad framework to help policymakers think about the set of choices and options they face in the design and management of an innovation agency.

    This report is the most comprehensive comparative study of innovation agencies that we know of to date. However, we are keen to develop this analysis through further collaboration with policymakers and experts around the world. Please do get in touch with comments and suggestions.

  abstract: The disclosure of open government data is a complex activity that may
    create public value yet might also encounter risks, such as the misinterpretation
    and misuse of data. While politicians support data release and assume that the
    positive value of open data will dominate, many governmental organizations are
    reluctant to open their data, as they are afraid of the dark side. The objective
    of this paper is to provide a decision-making model that assists in trade-offs
    between the pros and cons of open data. Data disclosure is dependent on the type
    of data (e.g. its sensitivity, structure and quality) and the context (e.g. organizational
    policies, legislation and the political influences). Based on the literature and
    fifteen in-depth interviews with public sector officials and data archivists,
    this paper identifies contextual and dataset-related variables which influence
    a trade-off. A decision-making model is presented capturing trade-offs, and in
    this way providing guidance for weighing the creation of public value and the
    risks. The model can be used for decision-making to open or not to open data.
    It is likely that the decision regarding which data should be opened or closed
    will shift over time.

  abstract: 'This article introduces the special issue on statactivism, a particular
    form of action within the repertoire used by contemporary social movements: the
    mobilization of statistics. Traditionally, statistics has been used by the worker
    movement within the class conflicts. But in the current configuration of state
    restructuring, new accumulation regimes, and changes in work organization in capitalists
    societies, the activist use of statistics is moving. This first article seeks
    to show the use of statistics and quantification in contentious performances connected
    with state restructuring, main transformations of the varieties of capitalisms,
    and changes in work organization regimes. The double role of statistics in representing
    as well as criticizing reality is considered. After showing how important statistical
    tools are in producing a shared reading of reality, we will discuss the two main
    dimensions of statactivism – disclosure and affirmation. In other words, we will
    see the role of stat-activists in denouncing a certain state of reality, and then
    the efforts to use statistics in creating equivalency among disparate conditions
    and in cementing emerging social categories. Finally, we present the main contributions
    of the various research papers in this special issue regarding the use of statistics
    as a form of action within a larger repertoire of contentious action. Six empirical
    papers focus on statactivism against the penal machinery in the early 1970s (Grégory
    Salle), on the mobilisation on the price index in Guadalupe in 2009 (Boris Samuel),
    and in Argentina in 2007 (Celia Lury and Ana Gross), on the mobilisations of experts
    to consolidate a link between working conditions and health issues (Marion Gilles),
    on the production of activity data for disability policy in France (Pierre-Yves
    Baudot), and on the use of statistics in social mobilizations for gender equality
    (Eugenia De Rosa). Alain Desrosières wrote the last paper, coping with mobilizations
    proposing innovations in the way of measuring inflation, unemployment, poverty,
    GDP, and climate change. This special issue is dedicated to him, in order to honor
    his everlasting intellectual legacy.'

  abstract: |-
    Crowdsourcing, itself a multidisciplinary field, can be well-served by incorporating theories and methods from affective computing. We present a various applications which are based on crowdsourcing. The direction of research on principles and methods can enable to solve a general problem via human computation systems. Crowdsourcing is nothing but an act of outsourcing tasks to a large group of people through an open request via the Internet. It has become popular among social scientists as a source to recruit research participants from the general public for studies. Crowdsourcing is introduced as the new online distributed problem solving model in which networked people collaborate to complete a task and produce the result. However, the idea of crowdsourcing is not new, and can be traced back to Charles Darwin. Darwin was interested in studying the universality of facial expressions in conveying emotions. For this, it required large amount of database and for this he had to consider a global population to get more general conclusions.

    This paper provides an introduction to crowdsourcing, guidelines for using crowdsourcing, and its applications in various fields. Finally, this article proposes conclusion which is based upon applications of crowdsourcing.

  abstract: Open government has become an important topic in democratically developed
    societies. Its key aims are to increase transparency, citizen trust and public
    participation. Against this background, the article focuses on perceived barriers
    opposing the introduction of open government data. On the basis of cognitive theory
    and a literature review, the essential factors that impede public servants in
    implementing open government data are conceptualized and summarized in a model.
    The perceived risk-based attitude of public servants is identified as the main
    barrier. Other significant obstacles include perceived legal barriers, perceived
    hierarchical structuring of authorities, perceived bureaucratic decision-making
    culture and perceived organizational transparency.

    designed to reduce the use of anti-black racist slurs by white men on Twitter.
    I collect a sample of Twitter users who have harassed other users and use accounts
    I control (“bots”) to sanction the harassers. By varying the identity of the bots
    between in-group (white man) and out-group (black man) and by varying the number
    of Twitter followers each bot has, I find that subjects who were sanctioned by
    a high-follower white male significantly reduced their use of a racist slur. This
    paper extends findings from lab experiments to a naturalistic setting using an
    objective, behavioral outcome measure and a continuous 2-month data collection
    period. This represents an advance in the study of prejudiced behavior.

  abstract: Transparency is increasingly evoked within public and private climate
    governance arrangements as a key means to enhance accountability and improve environmental
    outcomes. We review assumed links between transparency, accountability and environmental
    sustainability here, by identifying four rationales underpinning uptake of transparency
    in governance. We label these democratization, technocratization, marketization
    and privatization, and assess how they shape the scope and practices of climate
    disclosure, and to what effect. We find that all four are discernible in climate
    governance, yet the technocratic and privatization rationales tend to overtake
    the originally intended (more inclusive, and more public-good oriented) democratization
    and marketization rationales for transparency, particularly during institutionalization
    of disclosure systems. This reduces transparency's potential to enhance accountability
    or trigger more environmentally sustainable outcomes.

    data that is produced by a governmental entity. We describe the open government
    data life-cycle and we focus our discussion on publishing and consuming processes
    required within open government data initiatives. We cover current approaches
    undertaken for such initiatives, and classify them. A number of evaluations found
    within related literature are discussed, and from them we extract challenges and
    issues that hinder open government initiatives from reaching their full potential.
    In a bid to overcome these challenges, we also extract guidelines for publishing
    data and provide an integrated overview. This will enable stakeholders to start
    with a firm foot in a new open government data initiative. We also identify the
    impacts on the stakeholders involved in such initiatives.

  abstract: The goal of this project was to determine how insights from mobile data
    might be used to maximum effect in support of policy planning and crisis response
    with minimal risk to privacy. The project aimed to determine the impact that aggregating
    mobile data to protect privacy has upon the utility of the data for (i) transportation
    planning and (ii) pandemic control and prevention. Utility of each data set was
    evaluated by surveying transportation experts and epidemiologists; re-identification
    risk for each data set was also assessed. Risk of re-identification was subsequently
    considered together with data utility to determine which level of aggregation
    is the minimum required to adequately protectindividual privacy while preserving
    its value for policy planning and crisis response. Results of the analysis indicate
    that the relationship between privacy risk and utility is complex and is highly
    dependent on the context and purpose of use. Nevertheless, there is a risk of
    reidentification in applying mobile data for public good, and a better understanding
    is needed of the critical thresholds for acceptable risk. This project lays the
    groundwork for development of evidence-based data standards and policy frameworks
    to ensure proportionality between the risk of harm resulting from misuse of mobile
    data and the risk of harm resulting from a failure to use it.

  abstract: Over the last century, state and local governments have been challenged
    to keep proactive, emergency planning efforts ahead of the after-the-disaster,
    response efforts. After moving from decentralized to centralized planning efforts,
    the most recent policy has returned to the philosophy that a decentralized planning
    approach is the most effective way to plan for a disaster. In fact, under the
    Obama administration, a policy of using the “whole community” approach to emergency
    planning has been adopted. This approach, however, creates an obvious problem
    for state and local government practitioners already under pressure for funding,
    time, and the continuous need for higher and broader expertise—the problem of
    how to actually incorporate the whole community into emergency planning efforts.
    This article suggests one such approach, crowdsourcing, as an option for local
    governments. The crowdsourcer-problem-crowd-platform-solution (CPCPS) model is
    suggested as an initial framework for practitioners seeking a practical application
    and basic comprehension. The model, discussion, and additional examples in this
    essay provide a skeletal framework for state and local governments wishing to
    reach the whole community while under the constraints of time, budget, and technical
    expertise.

  abstract: 'Policy makers can use four different modes of governance: ‘hierarchy’,
    ‘markets’, ‘networks’ and ‘persuasion’. In this article, it is argued that ‘nudging’
    represents a distinct (fifth) mode of governance. The effectiveness of nudging
    as a means of bringing about lasting behaviour change is questioned and it is
    argued that evidence for its success ignores the facts that many successful nudges
    are not in fact nudges; that there are instances when nudges backfire; and that
    there may be ethical concerns associated with nudges. Instead, and in contrast
    to nudging, behaviour change is more likely to be enduring where it involves social
    identity change and norm internalisation. The article concludes by urging public
    policy scholars to engage with the social identity literature on ‘social influence’,
    and the idea that those promoting lasting behaviour change need to engage with
    people not as individual cognitive misers, but as members of groups whose norms
    they internalise and enact.'

    Background: Investigation into personal health has become focused on conditions at an increasingly local level, while response rates have declined and complicated the process of collecting data at an individual level. Simultaneously, social media data have exploded in availability and have been shown to correlate with the prevalence of certain health conditions.

    Objective: Facebook likes may be a source of digital data that can complement traditional public health surveillance systems and provide data at a local level. We explored the use of Facebook likes as potential predictors of health outcomes and their behavioral determinants.

    Methods: We performed principal components and regression analyses to examine the predictive qualities of Facebook likes with regard to mortality, diseases, and lifestyle behaviors in 214 counties across the United States and 61 of 67 counties in Florida. These results were compared with those obtainable from a demographic model. Health data were obtained from both the 2010 and 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and mortality data were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System.
    Results: Facebook likes added significant value in predicting most examined health outcomes and behaviors even when controlling for age, race, and socioeconomic status, with model fit improvements (adjusted R2) of an average of 58% across models for 13 different health-related metrics over basic sociodemographic models. Small area data were not available in sufficient abundance to test the accuracy of the model in estimating health conditions in less populated markets, but initial analysis using data from Florida showed a strong model fit for obesity data (adjusted R2=.77).

    Conclusions: Facebook likes provide estimates for examined health outcomes and health behaviors that are comparable to those obtained from the BRFSS. Online sources may provide more reliable, timely, and cost-effective county-level data than that obtainable from traditional public health surveillance systems as well as serve as an adjunct to those systems.

  abstract: |-
    The information systems of public institutions play a crucial role in how we collectively look at and act in the world. They shape the way decisions are made, progress is evaluated, resources are allocated, issues are  agged, debates are framed and action is taken. As a United Nations (UN) report recently put it, “Data are the lifeblood of decision-making and the raw material for accountability.”

    Every information system renders certain aspects of the world visible and lets others recede into the background. Datasets highlight some things and not others. They make the world comprehensible and navigable in their own way – whether for the purposes of policy evaluation, public service delivery, administration or governance.

    Given the critical role of public information systems, what happens when they leave out parts of the picture that civil society groups consider vital? What can civil society actors do to shape or in uence these systems so they can be used to advance progress around social, democratic and environmental issues?

    This report looks at how citizens and civil society groups can generate data as a means to in uence institutional data collection. In the following pages, we pro le citizen-generated and civil society data projects and how they have been used as advocacy instruments to change institutional data collection – including looking at the strategies, methods, technologies and resources that have been mobilised to this end. We conclude with a series of recommendations for civil society groups, public institutions, policy-makers and funders.

  abstract: |-
    Big data society has changed the traditional forms of data analysis and created a new predictive approach to knowledge and investigation. In this light, it is necessary to consider the impact of this new paradigm on the traditional notion of data protection and its regulation.

    Focussing on the individual and communal dimension of data use, encompassing digital investigations, the authors outline the challenges that big data poses for individual information self-determination, reasonable suspicion and collective interests. Therefore, the article suggests some innovative proposals that may update the existing data protection legal framework and contribute to make it respondent to the present algorithmic society.

  abstract: "Cities hold considerable information, including details about the daily
    lives of residents and employees, maps of critical infrastructure, and records
    of the officials’ internal deliberations. Cities are beginning to realize that
    this data has economic and other value: If done wisely, the responsible release
    of city information can also release greater efficiency and innovation in the
    public and private sector. New services are cropping up that leverage open city
    data to great effect. \n\nMeanwhile, activist groups and individual residents
    are placing increasing pressure on state and local government to be more transparent
    and accountable, even as others sound an alarm over the privacy issues that inevitably
    attend greater data promiscuity. This takes the form of political pressure to
    release more information, as well as increased requests for information under
    the many public records acts across the country. \n\nThe result of these forces
    is that cities are beginning to open their data as never before. It turns out
    there is surprisingly little research to date into the important and growing area
    of municipal open data. This article is among the first sustained, cross-disciplinary
    assessments of an open municipal government system. We are a team of researchers
    in law, computer science, information science, and urban studies. We have worked
    hand-in-hand with the City of Seattle, Washington for the better part of a year
    to understand its current procedures from each disciplinary perspective. Based
    on this empirical work, we generate a set of recommendations to help the city
    manage risk latent in opening its data.\n\n"

  abstract: |-
    Following a promising and already well established trend, in February 2014 the Office of the President of Mexico launched its open data portal (datos.gob.mx). This diagnostic – carried out between July and September of 2015 – is designed to brief international donors and stakeholders such as members of the Open Government Partnership Steering Committee, provides the reader with contextual information to understand the state of supply and demand for open data from the portal, and the specific challenges the Mexican government is facing in its quest to implement the policy.

    The insights offered through data proessing and interviews with key stakeholders indicate the need to promote: i) A sense of ownership of datos.gob.mx by the user community, but particularly by the officials in charge of implementing the policy within each government unit; ii) The development of tools and mechanisms to increase the quality of the data provided through the portal; and iii) Civic hacking of the portal to promote innovation, and a sense of appropriation that would increase the policy's long-term resilience to partisan and leadership change.

    edition is interested in studies that scrutinise big data and power in concrete
    fields of application. It brings together scholars from different disciplines
    who analyse the fields agriculture, education, border control and consumer policy.
    As will be made explicit in the following, each of the articles tells us something
    about firstly, what big data is and how it relates to power. They secondly also
    shed light on how we should shape “the big data society” and what research questions
    need to be answered to be able to do so.

  abstract: Does online voting mobilize citizens who otherwise would not participate?
    During the annual participatory budgeting vote in the southern state of Rio Grande
    do Sul in Brazil -- the world's largest -- Internet voters were asked whether
    they would have participated had there not been an online voting option (i-voting).
    The study documents an 8.2 percent increase in total turn-out with the introduction
    of i-voting. In support of the mobilization hypothesis, unique survey data show
    that i-voting is mainly used by new participants rather than just for convenience
    by those who were already mobilized. The study also finds that age, gender, income,
    education, and social media usage are significant predictors of being online-only
    voters. Technology appears more likely to engage people who are younger, male,
    of higher income and educational attainment, and more frequent social media users.

  abstract: 'The private sector is transforming at record speed for the digital economy.
    As recently as 2008, when America elected President Obama, most large companies
    had separate IT departments, which were seen as just that—departments—separate
    from the heart of the business. Now, as wireless networks connect the planet,
    and entire companies exist in the cloud, digital technology is no longer viewed
    as another arrow in the corporate quiver, but rather the very foundation upon
    which all functions are built. This, then, is the mark of the digital era: in
    order to remain successful, modern enterprises must both leverage digital technology
    and develop a culture that values its significance within the organization.'

  abstract: In the spirit of Jeremy Bentham's Political Tactics, this volume offers
    the first comprehensive discussion of the effects of secrecy and publicity on
    debates and votes in committees and assemblies. The contributors – sociologists,
    political scientists, historians, and legal scholars – consider the micro-technology
    of voting (the devil is in the detail), the historical relations between the secret
    ballot and universal suffrage, the use and abolition of secret voting in parliamentary
    decisions, and the sometimes perverse effects of the drive for greater openness
    and transparency in public affairs. The authors also discuss the normative questions
    of secret versus public voting in national elections and of optimal mixes of secrecy
    and publicity, as well as the opportunities for strategic behavior created by
    different voting systems. Together with two previous volumes on Collective Wisdom
    (Cambrige, 2012) and Majority Decisions (Cambridge, 2014), the book sets a new
    standard for interdisciplinary work on collective decision-making.

  abstract: New, “big” data sources allow measurement of city characteristics and
    outcome variables higher frequencies and finer geographic scales than ever before.
    However, big data will not solve large urban social science questions on its own.
    Big data has the most value for the study of cities when it allows measurement
    of the previously opaque, or when it can be coupled with exogenous shocks to people
    or place. We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they
    can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google
    Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting
    that similar image data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured
    areas of the developing world. We then discuss how survey techniques can be improved
    to better measure willingness to pay for urban amenities. Finally, we explain
    how Internet data is being used to improve the quality of city services.

  abstract: |-
    Governance Networks in the Public Sector presents a comprehensive study of governance networks and the management of complexities in network settings. Public, private and non-profit organizations are increasingly faced with complex, wicked problems when making decisions, developing policies or delivering services in the public sector. These activities take place in networks of interdependent actors guided by diverging and sometimes conflicting perceptions and strategies. As a result these networks are dominated by cognitive, strategic and institutional complexities. Dealing with these complexities requires sophisticated forms of coordination: network governance.

    This book presents the most recent theoretical and empirical insights into governance networks. It provides a conceptual framework and analytical tools to study the complexities involved in handling wicked problems in governance networks in the public sector. The book also discusses strategies and management recommendations for governments, business and third sector organisations operating in and governing networks.

  abstract: Anonymization or de-identification techniques are methods for protecting
    the privacy of subjects in sensitive data sets while preserving the utility of
    those data sets. The efficacy of these methods has come under repeated attacks
    as the ability to analyze large data sets becomes easier. Several researchers
    have shown that anonymized data can be reidentified to reveal the identity of
    the data subjects via approaches such as so-called "linking." In this report,
    we survey the anonymization landscape of approaches for addressing re-identification
    and we identify the challenges that still must be addressed to ensure the minimization
    of privacy violations. We also review several regulatory policies for disclosure
    of private data and tools to execute these policies.

  abstract: As government administrative data sets are increasingly made available
    for new (non-administrative) purposes, there is a need to improve access to such
    resources for voluntary and community organizations, social enterprises and private
    businesses for statistical analysis and evaluation purposes. The Justice Data
    Lab set up by the Ministry of Justice in the UK presents an innovative case of
    how administrative data can be linked to other data held by organizations delivering
    public services. The establishment of a unit within a secure setting holding evaluation
    and statistical expertise has enabled providers of programmes aimed at reducing
    re-offending to obtain evidence on how the impact of their interventions differs
    from that of a matched comparison group. This article explores the development
    of the Justice Data Lab, the methodological and other challenges faced, and the
    experiences of user organizations. The article draws out implications for future
    development of Data Labs and the use of administrative data for the evaluation
    of public services.

  abstract: The prevalence of mobile communication in the developing world is ever
    increasing, with now 89 active subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. With this access
    comes the potential for unprecedented insights into individuals and societies,
    such as migration patterns, economic transactions, and even importation routes
    of infectious diseases like Ebola. However, the absence of a common framework
    for sharing mobile phone data in privacy-conscientious ways and an uncertain regulatory
    landscape has made difficult scientists' utilization of this powerful data. In
    the latest paper in our Issues in Technology Innovation series, Yves-Alexandre
    de Montjoye, Jake Kendall, and Cameron F. Kerry explore important case studies
    that have uncovered valuable insights into understanding the spread of infectious
    diseases as well as strategies into micro-target outreach and driving update of
    health-seeking behavior. The authors argue for a more nuanced approach in protecting
    privacy related to mobile data, building a case for special exceptions made where
    data may be used for significant public good or to avoid serious harm to people.

  abstract: "A statement or action can be said to be manipulative if it does not sufficiently
    engage or appeal to people’s capacity for reflective and deliberative choice.
    One problem with manipulation, thus understood, is that it fails to respect people’s
    autonomy and is an affront to their dignity. Another problem is that if they are
    products of manipulation, people’s choices might fail to promote their own welfare,
    and might instead promote the welfare of the manipulator. To that extent, the
    central objection to manipulation is rooted in a version of Mill’s Harm Principle:
    People know what is in their best interests and should have a (manipulation-free)
    opportunity to make that decision. On welfarist grounds, the norm against manipulation
    can be seen as a kind of heuristic, one that generally works well, but that can
    also lead to serious errors, at least when the manipulator is both informed and
    genuinely interested in the welfare of the chooser. \n\nFor the legal system,
    a pervasive puzzle is why manipulation is rarely policed. The simplest answer
    is that manipulation has so many shades, and in a social order that values free
    markets and is committed to freedom of expression, it is exceptionally difficult
    to regulate manipulation as such. But as the manipulator’s motives become more
    self-interested or venal, and as efforts to bypass people’s deliberative capacities
    becomes more successful, the ethical objections to manipulation become very forceful,
    and the argument for a legal response is fortified. The analysis of manipulation
    bears on emerging first amendment issues raised by compelled speech, especially
    in the context of graphic health warnings. Importantly, it can also help orient
    the regulation of financial products, where manipulation of consumer choices is
    an evident but rarely explicit concern."

  abstract: 'This critical and scoping review essay analyses digital labour markets
    where labour-intensive services are traded by matching requesters (employers and/or
    consumers) and providers (workers). It focuses on digital labour markets which
    allow the remote delivery of electronically transmittable services (i.e. Amazon
    Mechanical Turk, Upwork, Freelancers, etc.) and those where the matching and administration
    processes are digital but the delivery of the services is physical and requires
    direct interaction. The former broad type is called Online Labour Markets (OLMs)
    and is potentially global. The latter broad type is termed Mobile Labour Markets
    (MLMs) and is by definition localised. The essay defines and conceptualises these
    markets proposing a typology which proves to be empirically valid and heuristically
    useful. It describes their functioning and the socio-demographic profiles of the
    participants, reviews their economic and social effects, discusses the possible
    policy implications, and concludes with a research agenda to support European
    level policy making. It alternates the discussion of ‘hard’ findings from experimental
    and quasi-experimental studies with analysis of ‘softer’ issues such as rhetorical
    discourses and media ‘hyped’ accounts. This triangulation is inspired by, and
    a tribute to, the enduring legacy of the work of Albert O. Hirschman and his view
    that ideas and rhetoric can become endogenous engines of social change, reforms,
    and policies. This essay tries to disentangle the rhetoric with available empirical
    evidence in order to enable a more rational debate at least in the discussion
    of policies, if not in the public arena. To do so, an in depth analysis of 39
    platforms was undertaken together with a formal review of 70 scientific sources.
    These two main sources have been integrated with: a) an exploration of 100 media
    accounts (business press, newspapers, magazines, and blogs); b) 50 reports and
    surveys produced by ‘interested parties’ (industrial associations, platforms own
    reports and public relation materials, think tanks with a clear political orientation,
    NGOs, trade unions, etc.); and c) about 200 indirectly relevant scientific contributions
    and policy reports (used as sources to contextualise and integrate the above sources,
    and to derive theoretical and interpretative insights). While the evidence is
    limited and inconclusive with respect to various dimensions, the findings of this
    essay show, among other things, that: a) individuals engage in these activities
    primarily for money, for a large segment of them this work is their primary source
    of income, and most are under-employed and self-employed and fewer are unemployed
    and inactive; b) matching frictions and hiring inefficiencies are widespread and
    even the OLMs are far from being globalised online meritocracies; c) a behavioural
    approach to big data exploration should be further applied because there is emerging
    evidence of heuristic and biases contributing to hiring inefficiencies.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents a viewpoint on an emerging dichotomy in data science:
    applications in which predictions of data- driven algorithms are used to support
    people in making consequential decisions that can have a profound effect on other
    people’s lives and applications in which data-driven algorithms act autonomously
    in settings of low consequence and large scale. An example of the first type of
    application is prison sentencing and of the second type is selecting news stories
    to appear on a person’s web portal home page. It is argued that the two types
    of applications require data, al- gorithms and models with vastly different properties
    along several dimensions, including privacy, equitability, robust- ness, interpretability,
    causality, and openness. Furthermore, it is argued that the second type of application
    cannot al- ways be used as a surrogate to develop methods for the first type of
    application. To contribute to the development of methods for the first type of
    application, one must really be working on the first type of application.'

    This report draws from original empirical research on Map Kibera, a community-based mapping project that takes full advantage of these technologies and similar initiatives, to present key insights and lessons on the challenges of reaching across the two worlds of open source and development to translate technological possibilities into realities. The study highlights issues concerning the sustainability and governance of initiatives relying on citizens as sources of information, particularly those that aim to make information available to others in a new information commons, a shared set of resources available to all. It provides a basis for considering their wider social benefits, the agendas and values of the actors that drive them, the types of partnerships that can sustain them into the future, and the risks introduced through the increased visibility of vulnerable communities supported through these tools.

  abstract: 'This editorial introduces a special issue resulting from a panel on Internet
    and policy organized by the Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford) at
    the 2015 International Conference on Public Policy (ICPP) held in Milan. Two main
    themes emerged from the panel: the challenges of high cost and low participation
    which many e-participation initiatives have faced; and the potential Big Data
    seems to hold for remedying these problems. This introduction briefly presents
    these themes and links them to the papers in the issue. It argues that Big Data
    can fix some of the problems typically encountered by e-participation initiatives:
    it can offer a solution to the problem of low turnout which is furthermore accessible
    to government bodies even if they have low levels of financial resources. However,
    the use of Big Data in this way is also a radically different approach to the
    problem of involving citizens in policymaking; and the editorial concludes by
    reflecting on the significance of this for the policymaking process.'

  abstract: Privacy policies are supposed to provide transparency about a service's
    data practices and help consumers make informed choices about which services to
    entrust with their personal information. In practice, those privacy policies are
    typically long and complex documents that are largely ignored by consumers. Even
    for regulators and data protection authorities privacy policies are difficult
    to assess at scale. Crowdsourcing offers the potential to scale the analysis of
    privacy policies with microtasks, for instance by assessing how specific data
    practices are addressed in privacy policies or extracting information about data
    practices of interest, which can then facilitate further analysis or be provided
    to users in more effective notice formats. Crowdsourcing the analysis of complex
    privacy policy documents to non-expert crowdworkers poses particular challenges.
    We discuss best practices, lessons learned and research challenges for crowdsourcing
    privacy policy analysis.

  abstract: This theme issue has the founding ambition of landscaping data ethics
    as a new branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related to
    data (including generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination, sharing
    and use), algorithms (including artificial intelligence, artificial agents, machine
    learning and robots) and corresponding practices (including responsible innovation,
    programming, hacking and professional codes), in order to formulate and support
    morally good solutions (e.g. right conducts or right values). Data ethics builds
    on the foundation provided by computer and information ethics but, at the same
    time, it refines the approach endorsed so far in this research field, by shifting
    the level of abstraction of ethical enquiries, from being information-centric
    to being data-centric. This shift brings into focus the different moral dimensions
    of all kinds of data, even data that never translate directly into information
    but can be used to support actions or generate behaviours, for example. It highlights
    the need for ethical analyses to concentrate on the content and nature of computational
    operations—the interactions among hardware, software and data—rather than on the
    variety of digital technologies that enable them. And it emphasizes the complexity
    of the ethical challenges posed by data science. Because of such complexity, data
    ethics should be developed from the start as a macroethics, that is, as an overall
    framework that avoids narrow, ad hoc approaches and addresses the ethical impact
    and implications of data science and its applications within a consistent, holistic
    and inclusive framework. Only as a macroethics will data ethics provide solutions
    that can maximize the value of data science for our societies, for all of us and
    for our environments.

  abstract: |2-

    We live in an information-driven and networked society (Castells, 1996). Hence, several public sectors, such as government, education and development cooperation, are in a transition from closed, formal organisations towards open and networked models of organisation. This transition in the development sector is termed Open Development, which can be defined as: “An emerging set of possibilities to catalyse positive change through open information-networked activities in international development” (Smith et al, 2011). This transition to open development is driven both by societal and technological trends. Firstly, the current debate on development effectiveness is pushing NGOs to plan, monitor and evaluate their work more effectively. Secondly, the end of the traditional rich North vs. poor South thinking requires NGOs to rethink their role and organisational model, as local NGOs, the private sector and local governments increasingly take control over development work in their country. Thirdly, the public concern on poor development spending sparks NGOs to improve their transparency and accountability. Finally, the budget austerity of governments in the North put pressure on NGOs to find new ways to fund their development activities. This pressure requires NGOs to collaborate with private foundations, citizens and businesses.

  abstract: Uganda has democratic deficits where demand for democracy exceeds its
    supply. As a consequence it is argued that a segment of Ugandans might participate
    and honour the freedom to speak out, assemble, and associate given new opportunities
    outside the traditional political channels. With expanded mobile coverage and
    access to mobile devices and services in mind, and using the concept of open crowdsourcing,
    the platform UgandaWatch was launched prior to the 2011 general elections with
    the intention to meet the demand, to offer increased equality of political participation,
    and to advance efforts toward increased citizen engagement in Uganda. From a community
    informatics point of view, the study examined how and under what conditions access
    to ICT tools (mobile devices, networks, and a crowdsourcing platform) can be made
    usable and useful for people and communities for increased political participation
    in a given context. By combining the collection and analysis of quantitative (SMS-survey)
    and qualitative data (focus groups) through a mixed-method approach, this study
    answers the questions, What are the key factors that influence users’ willingness
    to use mobile phones and crowdsourcing platforms as a channel for political participation?,
    and What concerns do users have with respect to using mobile phones and crowdsourcing
    platforms in the participation process? The study shows that users participated
    because they hoped it would bring real change to Uganda’s electoral and political
    landscape, that it was a convenient channel to use (quick and easy) and that confidentiality
    was assured. The user concerns relate to costs, trust, and safety. Crowdsourcing
    offers an alternative channel and may substitute or supplement traditional means
    of political participation. It can increase participation in some groups, including
    among those who normally do not participate—something that increases equality
    of political participation in a positive direction.

  abstract: This article examines citizen science projects, defined as “a form of
    open collaboration where members of the public participate in the scientific process,
    including identifying research questions, collecting and analyzing the data, interpreting
    the results, and problem solving,” as an effective and innovative tool for National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) science in line with the Obama Administration's
    Open Government Directive. Citizen science projects allow volunteers with no technical
    training to participate in analysis of large sets of data that would otherwise
    constitute prohibitively tedious and lengthy work for research scientists. Zooniverse.com
    hosts a multitude of popular space-focused citizen science projects, many of which
    have been extraordinarily successful and have enabled new research publications
    and major discoveries. This article takes a multifaceted look at such projects
    by examining the benefits of citizen science, effective game design, and current
    desktop computer and mobile device usage trends. It offers suggestions of potential
    research topics to be studied with emerging technologies, policy considerations,
    and opportunities for outreach. This analysis includes an overview of other crowdsourced
    research methods such as distributed computing and contests. New research and
    data analysis of mobile phone usage, scientific curiosity, and political engagement
    among Zooniverse.com project participants has been conducted for this study.

  abstract: The explosive growth in data, computational power, and social media creates
    new opportunities for innovating the processes and solutions of Information and
    communications technology (ICT) based policy-making and research. To take advantage
    of these developments in the digital world, new approaches, concepts, instruments
    and methods are needed to navigate the societal and computational complexity.
    This requires extensive interdisciplinary knowledge of public administration,
    policy analyses, information systems, complex systems and computer science. This
    book provides the foundation for this new interdisciplinary field, in which various
    traditional disciplines are blending. Both policy makers, executors and those
    in charge of policy implementations acknowledge that ICT is becoming more important
    and is changing the policy-making process, resulting in a next generation policy-making
    based on ICT support. Web 2.0 and even Web 3.0 point to the specific applications
    of social networks, semantically enriched and linked data, whereas policy-making
    has also to do with the use of the vast amount of data, predictions and forecasts,
    and improving the outcomes of policy-making, which is confronted with an increasing
    complexity and uncertainty of the outcomes. The field of policy-making is changing
    and driven by developments like open data, computational methods for processing
    data, opining mining, simulation and visualization of rich data sets, all combined
    with public engagement, social media and participatory tools.

  abstract: |-
    This paper starts by making the case for why a data revolution is needed, highlighting the parlous case of data globally, nationally and locally, focusing on social data, and stating why the gaps matter and how they should be plugged (Sections 1 to 3). Next, it discusses the innovative ways in which data are already being produced and used (Section 4). Finally we set out a vision for a fully- edged revolution, with an examination of outstanding challenges (Sections 5 and 6).

    Throughout, the paper highlights examples of a range of different uses for big and small data that are being piloted around the world. Some projects are already improving people’s lives, while others are still works in progress. But they demonstrate that the data revolution is already underway.

  abstract: This paper describes the methodology and the research associated with
    the development of an open data course for social movements, in the hope that
    this approach can be interesting to researchers and practitioners working in the
    Community Informatics field. In the sections that follow we first picture the
    open data scene and selected social movements in Brazil (where this research was
    undertaken); then we present some open data education experiences, and the methodological
    inspirations and research ideas that led to the development of the open data course.
    A detailed description of the course is followed by an analysis and synthesis
    of its outcomes, and conclusions.

    Context: The concept of citizen science (CS) is currently referred to by many actors inside and outside science and research. Several descriptions of this purportedly new approach of science are often heard in connection with large datasets and the possibilities of mobilizing crowds outside science to assists with observations and classifications. However, other accounts refer to CS as a way of democratizing science, aiding concerned communities in creating data to influence policy and as a way of promoting political decision processes involving environment and health.

    Objective: In this study we analyse two datasets (N = 1935, N = 633) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) with the aim of giving a scientometric description of what the concept of CS entails. We account for its development over time, and what strands of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms.

    Results: Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935), but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms has emerged for the collection and classification of data.

  abstract: 'The Age of Sharing Nicholas A. John Sharing is central to how we live
    today: it is what we do online; it is a model of economic behavior; and it is
    also a type of therapeutic talk. Sharing embodies positive values such as empathy,
    communication, fairness, openness and equality. The Age of Sharing shows how and
    when sharing became caring, and explains how its meanings have changed in the
    digital age.But the word ‘sharing’ also camouflages commercial or even exploitative
    relations. Websites say they share data with advertisers, although in reality
    they sell it, while parts of the sharing economy look a great deal like rental
    services. Ultimately, it is argued, practices described as sharing and critiques
    of those practices have common roots. Consequently, the metaphor of sharing now
    constructs significant swathes of our social practices and provides the grounds
    for critiquing them; it is a mode of participation in the capitalist order as
    well as a way of resisting it.Drawing on nineteenth-century literature, Alcoholics
    Anonymous, the American counterculture, reality TV, hackers, Airbnb, Facebook
    and more, The Age of Sharing offers a rich account of a complex contemporary keyword.
    It will appeal to students and scholars of the Internet, digital culture and linguistics.'

  abstract: 'Non-official sources of data, big data in particular, are currently attracting
    enormous interest in the world of official statistics. An impressive body of work
    focuses on how different types of big data (telecom data, social media, sensors
    and geospatial data, etc.) can be used to fill specific data gaps, especially
    with regard to the post-2015 agenda and the associated technology challenges.
    This paper focuses on different aspects of big data, but ones that are of crucial
    importance: what are the perspectives of the commercial operations and national
    statistical offices that respectively produce and might use this data; and which
    incentives, business models and protocols are needed to leverage non-official
    data sources within the official statistics community?'

  abstract: 'The powerful potential of digital media to engage citizens in political
    actions has now crossed our news screens many times. But scholarly focus has tended
    to be on "networked," anti-institutional forms of collective action, to the neglect
    of advocacy and service organizations. This book investigates the changing fortunes
    of the citizen-civil society relationship by exploring how social changes and
    innovations in communication technology are transforming the information expectations
    and preferences of many citizens, especially young citizens. In doing so, it is
    the first work to bring together theories of civic identity change with research
    on civic organizations. Specifically, it argues that a shift in "information styles"
    may help to explain the disjuncture felt by many young people when it comes to
    institutional participation and politics. The book theorizes two paradigms of
    information style: a dutiful style, which was rooted in the society, communication
    system and citizen norms of the modern era, and an actualizing style, which constitutes
    the set of information practices and expectations of the young citizens of late
    modernity for whom interactive digital media are the norm. Hypothesizing that
    civil society institutions have difficulty adapting to the norms and practices
    of the actualizing information style, two empirical studies apply the dutiful/actualizing
    framework to innovative content analyses of organizations'' online communications-on
    their websites, and through Facebook. Results demonstrate that with intriguing
    exceptions, most major civil society organizations use digital media more in line
    with dutiful information norms than actualizing ones: they tend to broadcast strategic
    messages to an audience of receivers, rather than encouraging participation or
    exchange among an active set of participants. The book concludes with a discussion
    of the tensions inherent in bureaucratic organizations trying to adapt to an actualizing
    information style, and recommendations for how they may more successfully do so.'

  abstract: What is the state of the research on crowdsourcing for policymaking? This
    article begins to answer this question by collecting, categorizing, and situating
    an extensive body of the extant research investigating policy crowdsourcing, within
    a new framework built on fundamental typologies from each field. We first define
    seven universal characteristics of the three general crowdsourcing techniques
    (virtual labor markets, tournament crowdsourcing, open collaboration), to examine
    the relative trade-offs of each modality. We then compare these three types of
    crowdsourcing to the different stages of the policy cycle, in order to situate
    the literature spanning both domains. We finally discuss research trends in crowdsourcing
    for public policy and highlight the research gaps and overlaps in the literature.

  abstract: This book brings together an impressive range of academic and intelligence
    professional perspectives to interrogate the social, ethical and security upheavals
    in a world increasingly driven by data. Written in a clear and accessible style,
    it offers fresh insights to the deep reaching implications of Big Data for communication,
    privacy and organisational decision-making. It seeks to demystify developments
    around Big Data before evaluating their current and likely future implications
    for areas as diverse as corporate innovation, law enforcement, data science, journalism,
    and food security. The contributors call for a rethinking of the legal, ethical
    and philosophical frameworks that inform the responsibilities and behaviours of
    state, corporate, institutional and individual actors in a more networked, data-centric
    society. In doing so, the book addresses the real world risks, opportunities and
    potentialities of Big Data.

  abstract: In this paper we describe the evolution and development of the police.uk
    and data.police.uk sites, which publish open data about crime and justice in the
    UK, and make it accessible and comprehensible to the public. Police.uk has received
    over 64 million visits (754 million hits) since launching in January 2011. Open
    crime and justice data represents a key sector in the UK open data landscape,
    and citizens are keen to engage with the criminal justice system to become more
    informed about local levels of crime and other policing information. This paper
    sets out the policing context in the UK, discusses the journey in providing such
    open data, the processes involved and challenges encountered, and explores possible
    future developments.

    of aggregated and anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) captured from the mobile
    phone infrastructure provides new possibilities to characterize human behavior
    during critical events. In this work, we investigate the viability of using CDR
    data combined with other sources of information to characterize the floods that
    occurred in Tabasco, Mexico in 2009. An impact map has been reconstructed using
    Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within this frame, the underlying communication
    activity signals in the CDR data have been analyzed and compared against rainfall
    levels extracted from data of the NASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number
    of active phones connected to each cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns
    in the most affected locations during and after the floods that could be used
    as signatures of the floods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment
    and population information awareness. The representativeness of the analysis has
    been assessed using census data and civil protection records. While a more extensive
    validation is required, these early results suggest high potential in using cell
    tower activity information to improve early warning and emergency management mechanisms.

  abstract: 'Open data have the potential to improve the governance of universities
    as public institutions. In addition, open data are likely to increase the quality,
    efficacy and efficiency of the research and analysis of higher education systems
    by providing a shared empirical base for critical interrogation and reinterpretation.
    Drawing on research conducted by the Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing
    Countries project, and using an ecosystems approach, this research paper considers
    the supply, demand and use of open data as well as the roles of intermediaries
    in the governance of South African public higher education. It shows that government''s
    higher education database is a closed and isolated data source in the data ecosystem;
    and that the open data that are made available by government is inaccessible and
    rarely used. In contrast, government data made available by data intermediaries
    in the ecosystem are being used by key stakeholders. Intermediaries are found
    to play several important roles in the ecosystem: (i) they increase the accessibility
    and utility of data; (ii) they may assume the role of a “keystone species” in
    a data ecosystem; and (iii) they have the potential to democratize the impacts
    and use of open data. The article concludes that despite poor data provision by
    government, the public university governance open data ecosystem has evolved because
    intermediaries in the ecosystem have reduced the viscosity of government data.
    Further increasing the fluidity of government open data will improve access and
    ensure the sustainability of open data supply in the ecosystem.'

  abstract: Big data is ubiquitous but heterogeneous. Big data can be used to tally
    clicks and traffic on web pages, find patterns in stock trades, track consumer
    preferences, identify linguistic correlations in large corpuses of texts. This
    book examines big data not as an undifferentiated whole but contextually, investigating
    the varied challenges posed by big data for health, science, law, commerce, and
    politics. Taken together, the chapters reveal a complex set of problems, practices,
    and policies. The advent of big data methodologies has challenged the theory-driven
    approach to scientific knowledge in favor of a data-driven one. Social media platforms
    and self-tracking tools change the way we see ourselves and others. The collection
    of data by corporations and government threatens privacy while promoting transparency.
    Meanwhile, politicians, policy makers, and ethicists are ill-prepared to deal
    with big data’s ramifications. The contributors look at big data’s effect on individuals
    as it exerts social control through monitoring, mining, and manipulation; big
    data and society, examining both its empowering and its constraining effects;
    big data and science, considering issues of data governance, provenance, reuse,
    and trust; and big data and organizations, discussing data responsibility, “data
    harm,” and decision making.

  abstract: |-
    Today, governments have access to a variety of tools to successfully implement agency programs. For example, Data Analytics—especially of financial data—can be used to better inform decision making by ensuring agencies have the information they need at the point of time that it can be most effective. In addition, governments at all levels can more effectively address risks using new Risk Management approaches. And finally, Shared Services can not only save money, but also stimulate innovation, improve decisionmaking, and increase the quality of services expected by citizens.

    The IBM Center has published a variety of reports related to these topics and accordingly, we have brought key findings on these topics together in the compilation that follows. We welcome your thoughts on these issues, and look forward to a continued dialogue with government leaders and stakeholders on actions to help agencies achieve their mission effectively and efficiently.

  abstract: 'Crowdsourcing design has been applied in various areas of graphic design,
    software design, and product design. This paper draws on those experiences and
    research in diversity, creativity and motivation to present a process model for
    crowdsourcing experience design. Crowdsourcing experience design for volunteer
    online communities serves two purposes: to increase the motivation of participants
    by making them stakeholders in the success of the project, and to increase the
    creativity of the design by increasing the diversity of expertise beyond experts
    in experience design. Our process model for crowdsourcing design extends the meta-design
    architecture, where for online communities is designed to be iteratively re-designed
    by its users. We describe how our model has been deployed and adapted to a citizen
    science project where nature preserve visitors can participate in the design of
    a system called NatureNet. The major contribution of this paper is a model for
    crowdsourcing experience design and a case study of how we have deployed it for
    the design and development of NatureNet.'

  abstract: This article presents an analysis of participation patterns in an Alternate
    Reality Game, World Without Oil. This game aims to bring people together in an
    online environment to reflect on how an oil crisis might affect their lives and
    communities as a way to both counter such a crisis and to build collective intelligence
    about responding to it. We present a series of participation profiles based on
    a quantitative analysis of 1554 contributions to the game narrative made by 322
    players. We further qualitatively analyze a sample of these contributions. We
    outline the dominant themes, the majority of which engage the global oil crisis
    for its effects on commute options and present micro-sustainability solutions
    in response. We further draw on the quantitative and qualitative analysis of this
    space to discuss how the design of the game, specifically its framing of the problem,
    feedback mechanism, and absence of subject-matter expertise, counter its aim of
    generating collective intelligence, making it conducive to groupthink.

  abstract: 'Much has been said about the appeal of digital government devices to
    enhance consultation on rulemaking. This paper explores the most ambitious attempt
    by the UK central government so far to draw on “crowdsourcing” to consult and
    act on regulatory reform, the “Red Tape Challenge.” We find that the results of
    this exercise do not represent any major change to traditional challenges to consultation
    processes. Instead, we suggest that the extensive institutional arrangements for
    crowdsourcing were hardly significant in informing actual policy responses: neither
    the tone of the crowdsourced comments, the direction of the majority views, nor
    specific comments were seen to matter. Instead, it was processes within the executive
    that shaped the overall governmental responses to this initiative. The findings,
    therefore, provoke wider debates about the use of social media in rulemaking and
    consultation exercises.'

  abstract: Governments buy about $9 trillion worth of goods and services a year,
    and their procurement policies are increasingly subject to international standards
    and institutional regulation including the WTO Plurilateral Agreement on Government
    Procurement, Open Government Partnership commitments and International Financial
    Institution procurement rules. These standards focus on transparency and open
    competition as key tools to improve outcomes. While there is some evidence on
    the impact of competition on prices in government procurement, there is less on
    the impact of specific procurement rules including transparency on competition
    or procurement outcomes. Using a database of World Bank financed contracts, we
    explore the impact of a relatively minor procurement rule governing advertising
    on competition using regression discontinuity design and matching methods. The
    rule does appear to have a small, positive impact on bidding levels, suggesting
    the potential for more significant and strongly enforced transparency initiatives
    to have a sizeable effect on procurement outcomes.

    Pioneering, diverse companies are using open data to create innovative products and services that fill gaps in markets, generate income and bring wide social, environmental and economic benefits.

    We have identified and analysed 270 companies that use, produce or invest in open data as part of their business, through desk research, surveys and interviews about their experiences. The open data companies we studied have an annual turnover of over £92bn, and over 500k employees between them. This shows the scale of open data’s potential value in business.

  abstract: 'The thesis focuses on the emergence of e-democracy in the UK between
    1999 and 2013. It examines the part that policy actors have played in shaping
    the agenda. Emphasis is placed on how e-democracy is  understood by those charged
    with developing initiatives and implementing government policy on  democracy.
    Previous research on e-democracy has focused largely on the impact of Web technologies
    on political systems and/or on how, why and to what degree, citizens participate.
    Less attention is paid to what happens inside government, in how policy actors’
    conceive public engagement in the policy process. Their perceptions and shared
    understandings are crucial to the commissioning, implementation, or deflection
    of participatory opportunities. This thesis is concerned with exploring how policy
    actors experience, interpret and negotiate e-democracy policy and practices and
    their perceptions of citizen involvement in the policy process. Competing discourses
    shape institutional expectations of e-democracy in the UK. The research examines
    how policy actors draw upon wider discourses such as the modernisation of government
    and the emphasis on transparency. It analyses understandings of technologies in
    government and the effects of relational interactions and linkages in policy and
    practice. The thesis draws on fieldwork in the UK from 23 in-depth, semi-structured
    interviews and participant observation data with a range of policy actors: civil
    servants from several government departments, government advisors and participation
    practitioners. In conjunction with interviews, documentary analysis was carried
    out on government documents, published between1999 and 2013. These focused on
    the role of Web technologies in government and include policy papers, advisory
    reports, audit reports and guidance for civil servants. Documentary analysis was
    combined with interviews and participant observation to compare the stated aims
    of e-democracy with the constraints and opportunities experienced by policy actors
    in their work. The findings highlight how contested interpretations of participation
    and differing approaches to technology affect the design, management and evaluation
    of projects. Such interpretations and contestations are not developed in isolation
    but emerge as actors come together in different spaces and configurations. Probing
    the relationships, motivations and perceptions of government insiders provides
    new insights about the development of e-democracy within the institutional context
    in the UK.'

  abstract: "In the vein of H Is for Hawk and the work of Rebecca Solnit and Elizabeth
    Kolbert—a masterful consideration of the profound, urgent necessity to bear witness
    to life and loss\n \n Here is a wide-ranging adventure in becoming a citizen scientist
    by an award-winning writer and environmental thought leader. As Mary Ellen Hannibal
    wades into tide pools, follows hawks, and scours mountains to collect data on
    threatened species, she discovers the power of a heroic cast of volunteers—and
    the makings of what may be our last, best hope in slowing an unprecedented mass
    extinction.\n \n Digging deeply, Hannibal traces today’s tech-enabled citizen
    science movement to its roots: the centuries-long tradition of amateur observation
    by writers and naturalists. Prompted by her novelist father’s sudden death, she
    also examines her own past—and discovers a family legacy of looking closely at
    the world. With unbending zeal for protecting the planet, she then turns her gaze
    to the wealth of species left to fight for.\n \n Combining original reporting,
    meticulous research, and memoir in impassioned prose, Citizen Scientist is a literary
    event, a blueprint for action, and the story of how one woman rescued herself
    from an odyssey of loss—with a new kind of science."

  abstract: 'This article takes stock of the growing field of online deliberation
    research. Our review of the theoretical and empirical findings is guided by a
    framework encompassing the three relevant components of deliberation: the institutional
    design that enables and fosters deliberation (institutional input: “design”),
    the quality of the communication process (communicative throughput: “process”),
    and the expected results of deliberation (productive outcome: “results”). Our
    findings show that scholarly attention is unevenly distributed across the different
    components of the framework. Most research has focused on the quality of the online
    discussion (process). A fair amount of research has focused on the institutional
    conditions fostering deliberation (design), while the outcomes of online deliberation
    processes (results) have mostly been neglected. This picture is repeated in terms
    of the causal relations between design, process, and results of deliberation:
    Most studies have dealt with the effects of the platform design on the degree
    of deliberation (design-process). Much less is known about how the process of
    deliberation shapes the outcomes of deliberation (process-results). Studies investigating
    all three aspects of deliberation and their causal links (design-process-results)
    are particularly rare.'

  abstract: In 2012, New York City Council passed legislation to make government data
    open and freely available to the public. By approving this legislation, City Council
    was attempting to make local government more transparent, accountable, and streamlined
    in its operations. It was also attempting to create economic opportunities and
    to encourage the public to identify ways in which to improve government and local
    communities. The purpose of this study is to explore public uses of New York City
    open data. Currently, more than 1300 datasets covering broad areas such as health,
    education, transportation, public safety, housing and business are available on
    the City’s Open Data Portal. This study found a plethora of maps, visualizations,
    tools, apps and analyses made by the public using New York City open data. Indeed,
    open data is inspiring a productive range of creative reuses yet questions remain
    concerning how useable the data is for users without technical skills and resources.

  abstract: Massive volumes of data are increasingly being generated at unprecedented
    rates as a result of advances in information technology and developments such
    as use of expanded mobile capabilities (supported by more powerful and increasingly
    widespread bandwidth). New approaches to combining and “making sense of” large
    amounts of varied data—methods referred to as advanced analytics—are helping to
    uncover patterns, identify anomalies, and provide insights not suggested by a
    priori hypotheses. In fact, advanced algorithms are enabling the automation of
    functions that require the ability to reason; for example, an algorithm may use
    data on weather, traffic, and roadways to estimate and provide real-time information
    to drivers on traffic delays and congestion. At the January 2016 forum, participants
    from industry, government, academia and nonprofit organizations considered potential
    implications of these developments. Their discussion of emerging forms of data,
    analytics, and innovation pointed to a combined process or cycle in which relevant
    data are generated and subjected to analysis, so that results can be applied to
    innovative decision making or uses. We term this process “data and analytics innovation.”
    Consideration of related impacts spanned the economy and society, and included
    new opportunities with accompanying challenges, as well as potentially negative
    impacts. Following the forum, participants reviewed a summary of forum discussions,
    and two experts (who did not attend the forum) independently reviewed a draft
    of this report. The report does not necessarily represent the views of any individual
    participant or organization.

  abstract: 'Crowdsourcing is an emerging technology where innovation and production
    are sourced out to the public through an open call. At the center of crowdsourcing
    is a resource allocation problem: there is an abundance of workers but a scarcity
    of high skills, and an easy task assigned to a high-skill worker is a waste of
    resources. This problem is complicated by the fact that the exact difficulties
    of innovation tasks may not be known in advance, so tasks that require high-skill
    labor cannot be identified and allocated ahead of time. We show that the solution
    to this problem takes the form of a skill hierarchy, where tasks are first attempted
    by low-skill labor, and high skill workers only engage with a task if less skilled
    workers are unable to finish it. This hierarchy can be constructed and implemented
    in a decentralized manner even though neither the difficulties of the tasks nor
    the skills of the candidate workers are known. We provide a dynamic pricing mechanism
    that achieves this implementation by inducing workers to self-select into different
    layers. The mechanism is simple: each time a task is attempted and not finished,
    its price (reward upon completion) goes up.'

  abstract: As cities become more complex and their communities more dispersed, questions
    such as ‘where is home?’ and ‘where and how do I belong?’ are increasingly pertinent.
    If urban space is a system, then it can be challenged through the spatial practice
    of its citizens. This contestation is examined as a form of hacking, an activity
    McKenzie Wark defined as the abstraction of new worlds. Drawing on the outcomes
    of a research project, this paper argues that digitally enabled creative writing
    can play a fundamental role within this process, enabling the re-appropriation
    of the smart city by its citizens.

  abstract: We describe Quizz, a gamified crowdsourcing system that simultaneously
    assesses the knowledge of users and acquires new knowledge from them. Quizz operates
    by asking users to complete short quizzes on specific topics; as a user answers
    the quiz questions, Quizz estimates the user's competence. To acquire new knowledge,
    Quizz also incorporates questions for which we do not have a known answer; the
    answers given by competent users provide useful signals for selecting the correct
    answers for these questions. Quizz actively tries to identify knowledgeable users
    on the Internet by running advertising campaigns, effectively leveraging the targeting
    capabilities of existing, publicly available, ad placement services. Quizz quantifies
    the contributions of the users using information theory and sends feedback to
    the advertising system about each user. The feedback allows the ad targeting mechanism
    to further optimize ad placement. Our experiments, which involve over ten thousand
    users, confirm that we can crowdsource knowledge curation for niche and specialized
    topics, as the advertising network can automatically identify users with the desired
    expertise and interest in the given topic. We present controlled experiments that
    examine the effect of various incentive mechanisms, highlighting the need for
    having short-term rewards as goals, which incentivize the users to contribute.
    Finally, our cost-quality analysis indicates that the cost of our approach is
    below that of hiring workers through paid-crowdsourcing platforms, while offering
    the additional advantage of giving access to billions of potential users all over
    the planet, and being able to reach users with specialized expertise that is not
    typically available through existing labor marketplaces.

  abstract: Many governments have recently begun to adopt the concept of open innovation.
    However, studies on the openness of government data and its effect on the global
    competitiveness have not received much attention. Therefore, this study aims to
    investigate the effects of government data openness on a knowledge-based economy
    at the government level. The proposed model was analyzed using secondary data
    collected from three different reports. The findings indicate that government
    data openness positively affects the formation of knowledge bases in a country
    and that the level of knowledge base of a country positively affects the global
    competitiveness of a country.

  abstract: This paper reviews the use of behavioural ideas to improve public policy.
    There needs to be a behavioural take on decision-making itself so that policies
    are designed in more effective ways. it recounts the beginnings of behavioural
    sciences as currently conceived and then setting out the massive expansion of
    interest that has come about since that time. It reports on how such ideas have
    had a large impact on governments at all levels across the world, but also noting
    how decision-making itself has been influenced by more policy-relevant ideas.
    The paper discusses the paradox that the very decision-makers themselves are subject
    to the same biases as the objects of behavioural economics, which might imply
    limitations in the choices of such interventions. Here the text of the chapter
    reengages with the classics of decision-making theory. The chapter notes how behavioural
    sciences need not depend on a top down approach but can incorporate citizen voice.
    The paper reviews how citizens and other groups can use behavioural cues to alter
    the behaviour of policy-makers in socially beneficial ways. The paper discusses
    how behaviourally informed measures could be integrated within the policy making
    process in ways that advance the effective use of evidence and nudge decision
    to make better policies.

  abstract: 'Does the digitization of land titles need to be framed within larger
    issues of Governance and move beyond narrow techno-administrative narratives?
    In doing so, what are the ranges of political economies that such interventions
    encounter and how do these relate to various forms of contests. What are readings
    of land titles digitization and its re-production in a variety of contexts of
    the ‘South’ and especially under conditions of globalization to contest with assumptions
    promoted by writers like Hernando De-Soto? This paper looks at the ‘Bhoomi program’
    and its consequence of digitizing land records in districts surrounding Bangalore.
    The Bhoomi program on the digitization of twenty million land records is considered
    a ‘best practice’ model of ‘e-governance’ to be replicated in other parts of India
    and elsewhere in poor countries. The main findings, at two levels, contrast conventional
    wisdom. First the digitization of land records led to increased corruption, much
    more bribes and substantially increased time taken for land transactions. At another
    level, it facilitated very large players in the land markets to capture vast quantities
    of land at a time when Bangalore experiences a boom in the land market. These
    consequences have come about via the centralization of both land records and management
    away from the village panchayat to the district level. The study comes out of
    detailed ethnographic research methods to detail out the process.

  abstract: All countries are investing in health data. There are however significant
    cross-country differences in data availability and use. Some countries stand out
    for their innovative practices enabling privacy-protective data use while others
    are falling behind with insufficient data and restrictions that limit access to
    and use of data, even by government itself. Countries that develop a data governance
    framework that enables privacy-protective data use will not only have the information
    needed to promote quality, efficiency and performance in their health systems,
    they will become a more attractive centre for medical research. After examining
    the current situation in OECD countries, a multi-disciplinary advisory panel of
    experts identified eight key data governance mechanisms to maximise benefits to
    patients and to societies from the collection, linkage and analysis of health
    data and to, at the same time, minimise risks to the privacy of patients and to
    the security of health data. These mechanisms include coordinated development
    of high-value, privacy-protective health information systems, legislation that
    permits privacy-protective data use, open and transparent public communication,
    accreditation or certification of health data processors, transparent and fair
    project approval processes, data de-identification and data security practices
    that meet legal requirements and public expectations without compromising data
    utility and a process to continually assess and renew the data governance framework
    as new data and new risks emerge.

  abstract: 'This paper presents a new database of indicators measuring the extent
    to which rulemaking processes are transparent and participatory across 185 countries.
    The data look at how citizen engagement happens in practice, including when and
    how governments open the policy-making process to public input. The data also
    capture the use of ex ante assessments to determine the possible cost of compliance
    with a proposed new regulation, the likely administrative burden of enforcing
    the regulation, and its potential environmental and social impacts. The data show
    that citizens have more opportunities to participate directly in the rulemaking
    process in developed economies than in developing ones. Differences are also apparent
    among regions: rulemaking processes are significantly less transparent and inclusive
    in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia on average
    than in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development high-income countries,
    Europe and Central Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific. In addition, ex ante impact
    assessments are much more common among higher-income economies than among lower-income
    ones. And greater citizen engagement in rulemaking is associated with higher-quality
    regulation, stronger democratic regimes, and less corrupt institutions.'

    and migration policies. Non-national disenfranchisement follows from certain migration
    policies, and these may be cast as an arbitrary form of domination, that may undermine
    political legitimacy. Political exclusion is the vertex of a chain of other forms
    of exclusion: the denizenship of the politically powerless is particularly bothersome
    because liberal-democratic systems lack incentives to promote their rights. We
    have singled out the specificity and quaintness of the argumentative strategy
    employed to sustain non-national disenfranchisement. It differs from other argumentations
    in favour of disenfranchisement because it is not framed in derogatory terms and
    shifts the burden of proof from the state over to the individual.'

  abstract: The widespread availability of high-quality Web-based content offers new
    potential for supporting teachers as designers of curricula and classroom activities.
    When coupled with a participatory Web culture and infrastructure, teachers can
    share their creations as well as leverage from the best that their peers have
    to offer to support a collective intelligence or crowdsourcing community, which
    we dubcrowdteaching. We applied a collective intelligence framework to characterize
    crowdteaching in the context of a Web-based tool for teachers called the Instructional
    Architect (IA). The IA enables teachers to find, create, and share instructional
    activities (called IA projects) for their students using online learning resources.
    These IA projects can further be viewed, copied, or adapted by other IA users.
    This study examines the usage activities of two samples of teachers, and also
    analyzes the characteristics of a subset of their IA projects. Analyses of teacher
    activities suggest that they are engaging in crowdteaching processes. Teachers,
    on average, chose to share over half of their IA projects, and copied some directly
    from other IA projects. Thus, these teachers can be seen as both contributors
    to and consumers of crowdteaching processes. In addition, IA users preferred to
    view IA projects rather than to completely copy them. Finally, correlational results
    based on an analysis of the characteristics of IA projects suggest that several
    easily computed metrics (number of views, number of copies, and number of words
    in IA projects) can act as an indirect proxy of instructionally relevant indicators
    of the content of IA projects.

  abstract: |-
    Background: Despite visits to multiple physicians, many patients remain undiagnosed. A new online program, CrowdMed, aims to leverage the “wisdom of the crowd” by giving patients an opportunity to submit their cases and interact with case solvers to obtain diagnostic possibilities.

    Objective: To describe CrowdMed and provide an independent assessment of its impact.

    Methods: Patients submit their cases online to CrowdMed and case solvers sign up to help diagnose patients. Case solvers attempt to solve patients’ diagnostic dilemmas and often have an interactive online discussion with patients, including an exchange of additional diagnostic details. At the end, patients receive detailed reports containing diagnostic suggestions to discuss with their physicians and fill out surveys about their outcomes. We independently analyzed data collected from cases between May 2013 and April 2015 to determine patient and case solver characteristics and case outcomes.

    Results: During the study period, 397 cases were completed. These patients previously visited a median of 5 physicians, incurred a median of US $10,000 in medical expenses, spent a median of 50 hours researching their illnesses online, and had symptoms for a median of 2.6 years. During this period, 357 active case solvers participated, of which 37.9% (132/348) were male and 58.3% (208/357) worked or studied in the medical industry. About half (50.9%, 202/397) of patients were likely to recommend CrowdMed to a friend, 59.6% (233/391) reported that the process gave insights that led them closer to the correct diagnoses, 57% (52/92) reported estimated decreases in medical expenses, and 38% (29/77) reported estimated improvement in school or work productivity.

    Conclusions: Some patients with undiagnosed illnesses reported receiving helpful guidance from crowdsourcing their diagnoses during their difficult diagnostic journeys. However, further development and use of crowdsourcing methods to facilitate diagnosis requires long-term evaluation as well as validation to account for patients’ ultimate correct diagnoses.

  abstract: Billions of dollars have been spent on participatory development programs
    in the developing world. These programs give community members an active decision-making
    role. Given the emphasis on community involvement, one might expect that the effectiveness
    of this approach would depend on communities' pre-existing social capital stocks.
    Using data from a large randomised field experiment of Community-Led Total Sanitation
    in Indonesia, we find that villages with high initial social capital built toilets
    and reduced open defecation, resulting in substantial health benefits. In villages
    with low initial stocks of social capital, the approach was counterproductive
    – fewer toilets were built than in control communities and social capital suffered.

    we conducted an extensive survey on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) with more than
    450 participants and 1400 questions. The paper has three main takeaways: First,
    we demonstrate the ability to generate survey questions corresponding to privacy
    norms within any context. Second, we show that crowdsourcing enables the discovery
    of norms from these questions with strong majoritarian consensus among users.
    Finally, we demonstrate how the norms thus discovered can be encoded into a formal
    logic to automatically verify their consistency.'

  abstract: The exponential growth of available information about routine police activities
    offers new opportunities to improve the fairness and effectiveness of police practices.
    We illustrate the point by showing how a particular kind of calculation made possible
    by modern, large-scale datasets — determining the likelihood that stopping and
    frisking a particular pedestrian will result in the discovery of contraband or
    other evidence of criminal activity — could be used to reduce the racially disparate
    impact of pedestrian searches and to increase their effectiveness. For tools of
    this kind to achieve their full potential in improving policing, though, the legal
    system will need to adapt. One important change would be to understand police
    tactics such as investigatory stops of pedestrians or motorists as programs, not
    as isolated occurrences. Beyond that, the judiciary will need to grow more comfortable
    with statistical proof of discriminatory policing, and the police will need to
    be more receptive to the assistance that algorithms can provide in reducing bias.

  abstract: 'We are awash in predictions about our data-driven future. Enthusiasts
    believe it will offer new ways to research behavior. Critics worry it will enable
    powerful regimes of institutional control. Both visions, although polar opposites,
    tend to downplay the importance of communication. As a result, the role of communication
    in human-centered data science has rarely been considered. This article fills
    this gap by outlining three perspectives on data that foreground communication.
    First, I briefly review the common social scientific perspective: “communication
    as data.” Next, I elaborate on two less explored perspectives. A “data as communication”
    perspective captures how data imperfectly carry meanings and guide action. “Communication
    around data” describes communication in organizational and institutional data
    cultures. I conclude that communication offers nuanced perspectives to inform
    human-centered data science. Researchers should embrace a robust agenda, particularly
    when researching the relationship between data and power.'

  abstract: 'The Internet is considered a huge development in human civilization.
    It is literally considered as a practical key or essential to human development
    and social advancement causing massive innovation in the world. Over the years,
    the advent of new media has permeated most aspects of our lives, especially that
    of the young generation. It is against this background that this paper aims to
    analyse the present use of the new media by youth to gauge their usage in relation
    to political participation. This study is a country wide survey covering Peninsula
    and East Malaysia. For sampling purposes the country is divided into six zones.
    A survey research using questionnaire as instrument was used to obtain data. Prior
    to the actual survey, a pilot study was first conducted. Some 1182 respondents
    age between 18 and 25 were randomly sampled from the six zones and selection of
    samples was based on ethnic ratio. The data was analysed descriptively and inferentially
    using SPSS 20.0 From the results, majority of the respondents, 89% are social
    media users having a social media account. A discouraging trend with regard to
    participation is the very low level of giving comments on general societal issues
    ranging from social issues, the environment to politics. The youth are more inclined
    to using the new media for entertainment and social networking. It is time to
    use the new media to engage with community leaders and politicians and comment
    on issues related to political issues. '

  abstract: Recent advances in online civic engagement tools have created a digital
    civic space replete with opportunities to craft and critique laws and rules or
    evaluate candidates, ballot measures, and policy ideas. These civic spaces, however,
    remain largely disconnected from one another, such that tremendous energy dissipates
    from each civic portal. Long-term feedback loops also remain rare. We propose
    addressing these limitations by building an integrative online commons that links
    together the best existing tools by making them components in a larger “Democracy
    Machine.” Drawing on gamification principles, this integrative platform would
    provide incentives for drawing new people into the civic sphere, encouraging more
    sustained and deliberative engagement, and feedback back to government and citizen
    alike to improve how the public interfaces with the public sector. After describing
    this proposed platform, we consider the most challenging problems it faces and
    how to address them.

  abstract: 'Beginning in May 2013 as part of the ''Exploring the Emerging Impacts
    of Open Data in Developing Countries'' (ODDC) research network managed by the
    World Wide Web Foundation and supported by the International Development Research
    Centre, Canada, this study was initially conceptualised by the author and Zainab
    Bawa of HasGeek Media LLP as a comparative study of organisations working with
    urban data in India. The proposed project originally planned to locate these policy
    documents, especially NDSAP, in the context of their actual implications and uses
    for non­government data practitioners. We wanted to focus on non­government advocacy
    and research organisations working in the area of urban development across five
    cities in India – Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and Pune – and to map their
    practices of collecting, accessing, sharing and using government and self­generated
    urban data, such as those related to property records, geo­spatial data, sanitation
    and public health, elected representatives etc. The two key questions for the
    study were: (1) how RTI and NDSAP have transformed approaches and processes of
    data practices, and (2) can the grounded experience of advocacy and research organisations
    inform shaping of a more effective and open data policy for India?'

  abstract: The agglomeration of rules and regulations over time has produced a body
    of legal code that no single individual can fully comprehend. This complexity
    produces inefficiencies, makes the processes of understanding and changing the
    law difficult, and frustrates the fundamental principle that the law should provide
    fair notice to the governed. In this article, we take a quantitative, unbiased,
    and software-engineering approach to analyze the evolution of the United States
    Code from 1926 to today. Software engineers frequently face the challenge of understanding
    and managing large, structured collections of instructions, directives, and conditional
    statements, and we adapt and apply their techniques to the U.S. Code over time.
    Our work produces insights into the structure of the U.S. Code as a whole, its
    strengths and vulnerabilities, and new ways of thinking about individual laws.
    For example, we identify the first appearance and spread of important terms in
    the U.S. Code like "whistleblower" and "privacy." We also analyze and visualize
    the network structure of certain substantial reforms, including the Patient Protection
    and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
    Protection Act, and show how the interconnections of references can increase complexity
    and create the potential for unintended consequences. Our work is a timely illustration
    of computational approaches to law as the legal profession embraces technology
    for scholarship, to increase efficiency, and to improve access to justice.

  abstract: This article builds on work in Science and Technology Studies and cognate
    disciplines concerning the institutionalization of public engagement and participation
    practices. It describes and analyses ethnographic qualitative research into one
    “organization of participation,” the UK government–funded Sciencewise program.
    Sciencewise’s interactions with broader political developments are explored, including
    the emergence of “open policy” as a key policy object in the UK context. The article
    considers what the new imaginary of openness means for institutionalized forms
    of public participation in science policymaking, asking whether this is illustrative
    of a “constitutional moment” in relations between society and science policymaking.

  abstract: 'In January 2014, the Centre for Information Policy Leadership (the Centre)
    launched a multiyear project on the risk-based approach to privacy: The Privacy
    Risk Framework Project. This project elaborates on the Centre’s earlier project
    on organisational accountability, particularly in seeking to develop the analytical
    framework and tools needed to implement certain key aspects of accountability.
    Specifically, the goals of this project are set forth in the following Project
    Vision Statement: Principle-based data privacy laws often leave room for interpretation,
    leaving it both to organisations to make appropriate decisions on how to implement
    these principles and to regulators on how to interpret and enforce the law. The
    Privacy Risk Framework Project aims to bridge the gap between high-level privacy
    principles on one hand, and compliance on the ground on the other, by developing
    a methodology for organisations to apply, calibrate and implement abstract privacy
    obligations based on the actual risks and benefits of the proposed data processing.
    While certain types of risk assessments are already an integral part of accountable
    organisations’ privacy management programs, they require further development.
    This project seeks to build consensus on what is meant by privacy risks to individuals
    (and society) and to create a practical framework to identify, prioritise and
    mitigate such risks so that principle-based privacy obligations can be implemented
    appropriately and effectively. On March 20, 2014, the Centre held a workshop in
    Paris during which more than 50 privacy experts, industry representatives and
    regulators discussed their experiences and views with respect to the risk-based
    approach to privacy, the privacy risk framework and methodology, as well as goals
    and next steps in this project. This paper, titled “A Risk-based Approach to Privacy:
    Improving Effectiveness in Practice”, is a developed version of the earlier discussion
    paper distributed to the participants of the workshop. It incorporates feedback
    from the Paris workshop and input received in subsequent consultations with Centre
    members and project participants.'
