  abstract: 'In 2008 the first Swiss canton introduced internet voting for expatriates,
    thus initiating the second phase in Switzerland’s piecemeal i-voting roll-out.
    More cantons soon followed, and as of this writing expatriates from 12 out of
    the 26 cantons can vote online. This paper focuses on the second phase involving
    expatriates. We address three questions at the core of the internet voting research
    agenda. First, the popularity question: to what extent do expatriates make use
    of the new online channel? Second, the ‘who’ question: what is the profile of
    the typical expatriate i-voter? Finally, the turnout question: did the extension
    of internet voting to the expatriates have an effect on electoral mobilization?
    Our findings indicate that the online channel is very popular among expatriates,
    both if compared to other trials in Switzerland itself and internationally. On
    the other hand, known patterns regarding the profile of i-voters and the effect
    on mobilization seem to be also replicated in the expatriate trials. Expatriate
    i-voters tend to be young, male, and there is some evidence of an upper-class
    bias. Thus, usage of the online channel seems driven by the digital divide also
    among expatriates. Moreover, we find some evidence that i-voting did not affect
    electoral mobilization, similarly to trials involving residents.'

  abstract: Epidemiology has made advances, thanks to the availability of real-time
    surveillance data and by leveraging the geographic analysis of incidents. There
    are many health information systems that visualize the symptoms of influenza-like
    illness on a digital map, which is suitable for end-users, but it does not afford
    further processing and analysis. Existing systems have emphasized the collection,
    analysis, and visualization of surveillance data, but they have neglected a modular
    and interoperable design that integrates high-resolution geo-location with real-time
    data. As a remedy, we have built an open-source project and we have been operating
    an open service that detects flu-related symptoms and shares the data in real-time
    with anyone who wants to built upon this system. An analysis of a small number
    of precisely geo-located status updates (e.g. Twitter) correlates closely with
    the Google Flu Trends and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention flu-positive
    reports. We suggest that public health information systems should embrace an open-source
    approach and offer linked data, in order to facilitate the development of an ecosystem
    of applications and services, and in order to be transparent to the general public
    interest.

  abstract: As the second phase of the Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing
    Countries (ODDC) drew to a close, discussions started on a possible venue for
    publishing some of the papers that emerged from the research conducted by the
    project partners. In 2012 the Journal of Community Informatics published a special
    issue titled ‘Community Informatics and Open Government Data’. Given the journal’s
    previous interest in the field of open data, its established reputation and the
    fact that it is a peer-reviewed open access journal, the Journal of Community
    Informatics was approached and agreed to a second special issue with a focus on
    open data. A closed call for papers was sent out to the project research partners.
    Shortly afterwards, the first Open Data Research Symposium was held ahead of the
    International Open Data Conference 2015 in Ottawa, Canada. For the first time,
    a forum was provided to academics and researchers to present papers specifically
    on open data. Again there were discussions about an appropriate venue to publish
    selected papers from the Symposium. The decision was taken by the Symposium Programme
    Committee to invite the twenty plus presenters to submit full papers for consideration
    in the special issue. The seven papers published in this special issue are those
    that were selected through a double-blind peer review process.

  abstract: A number of NGOs across the world currently develop digital tools to increase
    citizen interaction with official information. The successful operation of such
    tools depends on the expertise and efficiency of the NGO, and the willingness
    of institutions to disclose suitable information and data. It is this institutional
    interaction with civic technology that this study  examines. The research explores
    empirical interview data gathered from government officials, public servants,
    campaigners and NGO's involved in the development and implementation of civic
    technologies in Chile, Argentina and Mexico. The findings identify the impact
    these technologies have had upon government bureaucracy, and the existing barriers
    to openness created by institutionalised behaviours and norms. Institutionalised
    attitudes to information rights and conventions are shown to inform the approach
    that government bureaucracy takes in the provision of information, and institutionalised
    procedural behaviour is shown to be a factor in frustrating NGOs attempting to
    implement civic technology.

  abstract: Efficient and thorough data collection and its timely analysis are critical
    for disaster response and recovery in order to save peoples lives during disasters.
    However, access to comprehensive data in disaster areas and their quick analysis
    to transform the data to actionable knowledge are challenging. With the popularity
    and pervasiveness of mobile devices, crowdsourcing data collection and analysis
    has emerged as an effective and scalable solution. This paper addresses the problem
    of crowdsourcing mobile videos for disasters by identifying two unique challenges
    of 1) prioritizing visual-data collection and transmission under bandwidth scarcity
    caused by damaged communication networks and 2) analyzing the acquired data in
    a timely manner. We introduce a new crowdsourcing framework for acquiring and
    analyzing the mobile videos utilizing fine granularity spatial metadata of videos
    for a rapidly changing disaster situation. We also develop an analytical model
    to quantify the visual awareness of a video based on its metadata and propose
    the visual awareness maximization problem for acquiring the most relevant data
    under bandwidth constraints. The collected videos are evenly distributed to off-site
    analysts to collectively minimize crowdsourcing efforts for analysis. Our simulation
    results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework.

  abstract: "Improving public health is a major responsibility of any government,
    and is of major interest to citizens and scientific communities around the world.
    Here, one sees two extremes. On one hand, tremendous progress has been made in
    recent years in the understanding of causes, spread and remedies of common and
    regularly occurring diseases like Dengue, Malaria and Japanese Encephalistis (JE).
    On the other hand, public agencies treat these diseases in an ad hoc manner without
    learning from the experiences of previous years. Specifically, they would get
    alerted once reported cases have already arisen substantially in the known disease
    season, reactively initiate a few actions and then document the disease impact
    (cases, deaths) for that period, only to forget this learning in the next season.
    However, they miss the opportunity to reduce preventable deaths and sickness,
    and their corresponding economic impact, which scientific progress could have
    enabled. The gap is universal but very prominent in developing countries like
    India.\n\n \n\nIn this paper, we show that if public agencies provide historical
    disease impact information openly, it can be analyzed with statistical and machine
    learning techniques, correlated with best emerging practices in disease control,
    and simulated in a setting to optimize social benefits to provide timely guidance
    for new disease seasons and regions. We illustrate using open data for mosquito-borne
    communicable diseases; published results in public health on efficacy of Dengue
    control methods and apply it on a simulated typical city for maximal benefits
    with available resources. The exercise helps us further suggest strategies for
    new regions that may be anywhere in the world, how data could be better recorded
    by city agencies and what prevention methods should medical community focus on
    for wider impact."

  abstract: Political leaders and civic advocates are increasingly recommending that
    open access be the “default state” for much of the information held by government
    agencies. Over the past several years, they have driven the launch of open data
    initiatives across hundreds of national, state, and local governments. These initiatives
    are founded on a presumption of openness for government data and have led to the
    public release of large quantities data through a variety of channels. At the
    same time, much of the data that have been released, or are being considered for
    release, pertain to the behavior and characteristics of individual citizens, highlighting
    tensions between open data and privacy. This research briefing offers a snapshot
    of recent developments in the open data and privacy landscape, outlines an action
    map of various governance approaches to protecting privacy when releasing open
    data, and identifies key opportunities for decision-makers seeking to respond
    to challenges in this space.

  abstract: How will big data impact environmental law in the near future? This Essay
    imagines one possible future for environmental law in 2030 that focuses on the
    implications of big data for the protection of public health from risks associated
    with pollution and industrial chemicals. It assumes the perspective of an historian
    looking back from the end of the twenty-first century at the evolution of environmental
    law during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The premise of
    the Essay is that big data will drive a major shift in the underlying knowledge
    practices of environmental law (along with other areas of law focused on health
    and safety). This change in the epistemic foundations of environmental law, it
    is argued, will in turn have important, far-reaching implications for environmental
    law’s normative commitments and for its ability to discharge its statutory responsibilities.
    In particular, by significantly enhancing the ability of environmental regulators
    to make harm more visible and more traceable, big data will put considerable pressure
    on previous understandings of acceptable risk across populations, pushing toward
    a more singular and more individualized understanding of harm. This will raise
    new and difficult questions regarding environmental law’s capacity to confront
    and take responsibility for the actual lives caught up in the tragic choices it
    is called upon to make. In imagining this near future, the Essay takes a somewhat
    exaggerated and, some might argue, overly pessimistic view of the implications
    of big data for environmental law’s efforts to protect public health. This is
    done not out of a conviction that such a future is likely, but rather to highlight
    some of the potential problems that may arise as big data becomes a more prominent
    part of environmental protection. In an age of data triumphalism, such a perspective,
    it is hoped, may provide grounds for a more critical engagement with the tools
    and knowledge practices that inform environmental law and the implications of
    those tools for environmental law’s ability to meet its obligations. Of course,
    there are other possible futures, and big data surely has the potential to make
    many positive contributions to environmental protection in the coming decades.
    Whether it will do so will depend in no small part on the collective choices we
    make to manage these new capabilities in the years ahead.

  abstract: 'Transparency’s importance as an administrative norm seems self-evident.
    Prevailing ideals of political theory stipulate that the more visible government
    is, the more democratic, accountable, and legitimate it appears. The disclosure
    of state information consistently disappoints, however: there is never enough
    of it, while it often seems not to produce a truer democracy, a more accountable
    state, better policies, and a more contented populace. This gap between theory
    and practice suggests that the theoretical assumptions that provide the basis
    for transparency are wrong. This article argues that transparency is best understood
    as a theory of communication that excessively simplifies and thus is blind to
    the complexities of the contemporary state, government information, and the public.
    Taking them fully into account, the article argues, should lead us to question
    the state’s ability to control information, which in turn should make us question
    not only the improbability of the state making itself visible, but also the improbability
    of the state keeping itself secret.'

  abstract: |-
    Nowadays there is a multitude of mobile and tablet applications being developed in order to facilitate or disrupt every day tasks. Many of these are location based. A technique to serve in providing information and content is crowdsourcing. This technique is based on the public contributing information or resources giving them the opportunity to become both service providers and recipients at the same time.

    Taking into account the above and after observing passengers using the public transport system, we came to the conclusion that it would be useful to be able to determine which transport medium (i.e which bus line out of a number running concurrently) is nearer at any given moment. This information allows for better decision making and choice of transportation.

    For this we propose the development of an application to show the position of a selected transport vehicle. The position will be calculated based on geo-tracking provided by passengers boarded on a vehicle. This will allow for real time information to the application users in order to be able to determine their optimal route.
