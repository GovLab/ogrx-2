  abstract: 'This book provides key strategic principles and best practices to guide
    the design and implementation of digital government strategies. It provides a
    series of recommendations and findings to think about IT applications in government
    as a platform for information, services and collaboration, and strategies to avoid
    identified pitfalls. Digital government research suggests that information technologies
    have the potential to generate immense public value and transform the relationships
    between governments, citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders. However, developing
    innovative and high impact solutions for citizens hinges on the development of
    strategic institutional, organizational and technical capabilities. Thus far,
    particular characteristics and problems of the public sector organization promote
    the development of poorly integrated and difficult to maintain applications. For
    example, governments maintain separate applications for open data, transparency,
    and public services, leading to duplication of efforts and a waste of resources.
    The costs associated with maintaining such sets of poorly integrated systems may
    limit the use of resources to future projects and innovation. This book provides
    best practices and recommendations based on extensive research in both Mexico
    and the United States on how governments can develop a digital government strategy
    for creating public value, how to finance digital innovation in the public sector,
    how to build successful collaboration networks and foster citizen engagement,
    and how to correctly implement open government projects and open data. It will
    be of interest to researchers, practitioners, students and the public sector IT
    professionals that work in the design and implementation of technology-based project
    and programs. '
