  abstract: This theme issue has the founding ambition of landscaping data ethics
    as a new branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related to
    data (including generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination, sharing
    and use), algorithms (including artificial intelligence, artificial agents, machine
    learning and robots) and corresponding practices (including responsible innovation,
    programming, hacking and professional codes), in order to formulate and support
    morally good solutions (e.g. right conducts or right values). Data ethics builds
    on the foundation provided by computer and information ethics but, at the same
    time, it refines the approach endorsed so far in this research field, by shifting
    the level of abstraction of ethical enquiries, from being information-centric
    to being data-centric. This shift brings into focus the different moral dimensions
    of all kinds of data, even data that never translate directly into information
    but can be used to support actions or generate behaviours, for example. It highlights
    the need for ethical analyses to concentrate on the content and nature of computational
    operations—the interactions among hardware, software and data—rather than on the
    variety of digital technologies that enable them. And it emphasizes the complexity
    of the ethical challenges posed by data science. Because of such complexity, data
    ethics should be developed from the start as a macroethics, that is, as an overall
    framework that avoids narrow, ad hoc approaches and addresses the ethical impact
    and implications of data science and its applications within a consistent, holistic
    and inclusive framework. Only as a macroethics will data ethics provide solutions
    that can maximize the value of data science for our societies, for all of us and
    for our environments.

  abstract: 'Beginning in May 2013 as part of the ''Exploring the Emerging Impacts
    of Open Data in Developing Countries'' (ODDC) research network managed by the
    World Wide Web Foundation and supported by the International Development Research
    Centre, Canada, this study was initially conceptualised by the author and Zainab
    Bawa of HasGeek Media LLP as a comparative study of organisations working with
    urban data in India. The proposed project originally planned to locate these policy
    documents, especially NDSAP, in the context of their actual implications and uses
    for non­government data practitioners. We wanted to focus on non­government advocacy
    and research organisations working in the area of urban development across five
    cities in India – Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and Pune – and to map their
    practices of collecting, accessing, sharing and using government and self­generated
    urban data, such as those related to property records, geo­spatial data, sanitation
    and public health, elected representatives etc. The two key questions for the
    study were: (1) how RTI and NDSAP have transformed approaches and processes of
    data practices, and (2) can the grounded experience of advocacy and research organisations
    inform shaping of a more effective and open data policy for India?'

  abstract: 'The thesis focuses on the emergence of e-democracy in the UK between
    1999 and 2013. It examines the part that policy actors have played in shaping
    the agenda. Emphasis is placed on how e-democracy is  understood by those charged
    with developing initiatives and implementing government policy on  democracy.
    Previous research on e-democracy has focused largely on the impact of Web technologies
    on political systems and/or on how, why and to what degree, citizens participate.
    Less attention is paid to what happens inside government, in how policy actors’
    conceive public engagement in the policy process. Their perceptions and shared
    understandings are crucial to the commissioning, implementation, or deflection
    of participatory opportunities. This thesis is concerned with exploring how policy
    actors experience, interpret and negotiate e-democracy policy and practices and
    their perceptions of citizen involvement in the policy process. Competing discourses
    shape institutional expectations of e-democracy in the UK. The research examines
    how policy actors draw upon wider discourses such as the modernisation of government
    and the emphasis on transparency. It analyses understandings of technologies in
    government and the effects of relational interactions and linkages in policy and
    practice. The thesis draws on fieldwork in the UK from 23 in-depth, semi-structured
    interviews and participant observation data with a range of policy actors: civil
    servants from several government departments, government advisors and participation
    practitioners. In conjunction with interviews, documentary analysis was carried
    out on government documents, published between1999 and 2013. These focused on
    the role of Web technologies in government and include policy papers, advisory
    reports, audit reports and guidance for civil servants. Documentary analysis was
    combined with interviews and participant observation to compare the stated aims
    of e-democracy with the constraints and opportunities experienced by policy actors
    in their work. The findings highlight how contested interpretations of participation
    and differing approaches to technology affect the design, management and evaluation
    of projects. Such interpretations and contestations are not developed in isolation
    but emerge as actors come together in different spaces and configurations. Probing
    the relationships, motivations and perceptions of government insiders provides
    new insights about the development of e-democracy within the institutional context
    in the UK.'

  abstract: "In the vein of H Is for Hawk and the work of Rebecca Solnit and Elizabeth
    Kolbert—a masterful consideration of the profound, urgent necessity to bear witness
    to life and loss\n \n Here is a wide-ranging adventure in becoming a citizen scientist
    by an award-winning writer and environmental thought leader. As Mary Ellen Hannibal
    wades into tide pools, follows hawks, and scours mountains to collect data on
    threatened species, she discovers the power of a heroic cast of volunteers—and
    the makings of what may be our last, best hope in slowing an unprecedented mass
    extinction.\n \n Digging deeply, Hannibal traces today’s tech-enabled citizen
    science movement to its roots: the centuries-long tradition of amateur observation
    by writers and naturalists. Prompted by her novelist father’s sudden death, she
    also examines her own past—and discovers a family legacy of looking closely at
    the world. With unbending zeal for protecting the planet, she then turns her gaze
    to the wealth of species left to fight for.\n \n Combining original reporting,
    meticulous research, and memoir in impassioned prose, Citizen Scientist is a literary
    event, a blueprint for action, and the story of how one woman rescued herself
    from an odyssey of loss—with a new kind of science."

  abstract: Governments buy about $9 trillion worth of goods and services a year,
    and their procurement policies are increasingly subject to international standards
    and institutional regulation including the WTO Plurilateral Agreement on Government
    Procurement, Open Government Partnership commitments and International Financial
    Institution procurement rules. These standards focus on transparency and open
    competition as key tools to improve outcomes. While there is some evidence on
    the impact of competition on prices in government procurement, there is less on
    the impact of specific procurement rules including transparency on competition
    or procurement outcomes. Using a database of World Bank financed contracts, we
    explore the impact of a relatively minor procurement rule governing advertising
    on competition using regression discontinuity design and matching methods. The
    rule does appear to have a small, positive impact on bidding levels, suggesting
    the potential for more significant and strongly enforced transparency initiatives
    to have a sizeable effect on procurement outcomes.

  abstract: 'This article looks at the promise of technology to revolutionise humanitarian
    action, especially in terms of the gathering and use of data. With many heralding
    a ‘data revolution’, the opportunities and enthusiasm for using social media and
    SMS data in crisis response are on the rise. The article constructs an analytical
    framework in order to scrutinise the three main claims made on behalf of technologically
    advanced humanitarian information systems: that they can access data more accurately,
    more quickly, and alter power relations in emancipatory ways. It does so in relation
    to two aspects of digital humanitarianism: visual technology and crisis mapping,
    and big data. The article is partly informed by a historical perspective, but
    also by interview and other material that suggests some of the claims made on
    behalf of technology are exaggerated. In particular, we argue that the enthusiasm
    for the data is vastly outstripped by the capacity to meaningfully analyse it.
    We conclude by scoping the implications of the future technological evolution
    of humanitarianism, in particular by examining how technology contributes to what
    Duffield terms ‘post-modern humanitarianism’.'

    Context: The concept of citizen science (CS) is currently referred to by many actors inside and outside science and research. Several descriptions of this purportedly new approach of science are often heard in connection with large datasets and the possibilities of mobilizing crowds outside science to assists with observations and classifications. However, other accounts refer to CS as a way of democratizing science, aiding concerned communities in creating data to influence policy and as a way of promoting political decision processes involving environment and health.

    Objective: In this study we analyse two datasets (N = 1935, N = 633) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) with the aim of giving a scientometric description of what the concept of CS entails. We account for its development over time, and what strands of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms.

    Results: Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935), but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms has emerged for the collection and classification of data.

  abstract: Recent debate and associated initiatives dealing with public sector innovation
    have mainly aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery
    of public services and improved transparency and user friendliness. Beyond typical
    administrative reforms, innovation is expected to help address societal challenges
    such as the aging population, inclusion, health care, education, public safety,
    environment and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The public sector consists
    of a complex open system of organizations with various tasks. Therefore, decision-making
    can be slower than in the private sector because of large chains of command. Innovations
    here will often have an impact across this complex organizational structure, and
    thus must be supported by a robust strategy. To strengthen democracy, promote
    government efficiency and effectiveness, discourage wastes and misuses of government
    resources, public administrations have to promote a new stronger level of openness
    in government. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe an innovative approach
    for the governance of public systems and services, currently applied in the Italian
    public administration domain, which could be easily replicated in other countries
    as well. Two initiatives, to collect and provide relevant public information gathered
    from different and heterogeneous public organizations, to improve government processes
    and increase quality of services for citizens and companies, are described. The
    cases adopted have been validated through a Case Studies approach involving the
    Italian Agency for the public administration digitalization to understand new
    e-government scenarios within the context of governmental reforms heavily influenced
    by the principles of Open Government Model.

  abstract: The explosive growth in data, computational power, and social media creates
    new opportunities for innovating the processes and solutions of Information and
    communications technology (ICT) based policy-making and research. To take advantage
    of these developments in the digital world, new approaches, concepts, instruments
    and methods are needed to navigate the societal and computational complexity.
    This requires extensive interdisciplinary knowledge of public administration,
    policy analyses, information systems, complex systems and computer science. This
    book provides the foundation for this new interdisciplinary field, in which various
    traditional disciplines are blending. Both policy makers, executors and those
    in charge of policy implementations acknowledge that ICT is becoming more important
    and is changing the policy-making process, resulting in a next generation policy-making
    based on ICT support. Web 2.0 and even Web 3.0 point to the specific applications
    of social networks, semantically enriched and linked data, whereas policy-making
    has also to do with the use of the vast amount of data, predictions and forecasts,
    and improving the outcomes of policy-making, which is confronted with an increasing
    complexity and uncertainty of the outcomes. The field of policy-making is changing
    and driven by developments like open data, computational methods for processing
    data, opining mining, simulation and visualization of rich data sets, all combined
    with public engagement, social media and participatory tools.

    This paper starts by making the case for why a data revolution is needed, highlighting the parlous case of data globally, nationally and locally, focusing on social data, and stating why the gaps matter and how they should be plugged (Sections 1 to 3). Next, it discusses the innovative ways in which data are already being produced and used (Section 4). Finally we set out a vision for a fully- edged revolution, with an examination of outstanding challenges (Sections 5 and 6).

    Throughout, the paper highlights examples of a range of different uses for big and small data that are being piloted around the world. Some projects are already improving people’s lives, while others are still works in progress. But they demonstrate that the data revolution is already underway.

  abstract: This article examines citizen science projects, defined as “a form of
    open collaboration where members of the public participate in the scientific process,
    including identifying research questions, collecting and analyzing the data, interpreting
    the results, and problem solving,” as an effective and innovative tool for National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) science in line with the Obama Administration's
    Open Government Directive. Citizen science projects allow volunteers with no technical
    training to participate in analysis of large sets of data that would otherwise
    constitute prohibitively tedious and lengthy work for research scientists. Zooniverse.com
    hosts a multitude of popular space-focused citizen science projects, many of which
    have been extraordinarily successful and have enabled new research publications
    and major discoveries. This article takes a multifaceted look at such projects
    by examining the benefits of citizen science, effective game design, and current
    desktop computer and mobile device usage trends. It offers suggestions of potential
    research topics to be studied with emerging technologies, policy considerations,
    and opportunities for outreach. This analysis includes an overview of other crowdsourced
    research methods such as distributed computing and contests. New research and
    data analysis of mobile phone usage, scientific curiosity, and political engagement
    among Zooniverse.com project participants has been conducted for this study.

  abstract: |2-

    We live in an information-driven and networked society (Castells, 1996). Hence, several public sectors, such as government, education and development cooperation, are in a transition from closed, formal organisations towards open and networked models of organisation. This transition in the development sector is termed Open Development, which can be defined as: “An emerging set of possibilities to catalyse positive change through open information-networked activities in international development” (Smith et al, 2011). This transition to open development is driven both by societal and technological trends. Firstly, the current debate on development effectiveness is pushing NGOs to plan, monitor and evaluate their work more effectively. Secondly, the end of the traditional rich North vs. poor South thinking requires NGOs to rethink their role and organisational model, as local NGOs, the private sector and local governments increasingly take control over development work in their country. Thirdly, the public concern on poor development spending sparks NGOs to improve their transparency and accountability. Finally, the budget austerity of governments in the North put pressure on NGOs to find new ways to fund their development activities. This pressure requires NGOs to collaborate with private foundations, citizens and businesses.

  abstract: This powerful resource identifies wide-scale health challenges facing
    a rapidly urbanizing planet--including key concerns in nutrition, health status,
    health care, and safety--and strategies toward possible solutions. Theoretical
    and empirical analysis focuses on maximizing the benefits of urban living and
    minimizing negative outcomes across areas for improvement (health education, maternal
    and child health) and threats to well-being (noise pollution, drug counterfeiting).
    For each challenge, contributors discuss implications for health, specific practices
    that fuel them, and emerging ideas for solving them efficiently and effectively.
    Not only are these issues of immediate salience, they will become dangerously
    urgent in years to come.

  abstract: The exponential growth of available information about routine police activities
    offers new opportunities to improve the fairness and effectiveness of police practices.
    We illustrate the point by showing how a particular kind of calculation made possible
    by modern, large-scale datasets — determining the likelihood that stopping and
    frisking a particular pedestrian will result in the discovery of contraband or
    other evidence of criminal activity — could be used to reduce the racially disparate
    impact of pedestrian searches and to increase their effectiveness. For tools of
    this kind to achieve their full potential in improving policing, though, the legal
    system will need to adapt. One important change would be to understand police
    tactics such as investigatory stops of pedestrians or motorists as programs, not
    as isolated occurrences. Beyond that, the judiciary will need to grow more comfortable
    with statistical proof of discriminatory policing, and the police will need to
    be more receptive to the assistance that algorithms can provide in reducing bias.

  abstract: Reflecting on the governance of smart cities, the state-of-the-art this
    paper advances offers a critique of recent city ranking and future Internet accounts
    of their development. Armed with these critical insights, it goes on to explain
    smart cities in terms of the social networks, cultural attributes and environmental
    capacities, vis-a-vis, vital ecologies of the intellectual capital, wealth creation
    and standards of participatory governance regulating their development. The Triple
    Helix model which the paper advances to explain these performances in turn suggests
    that cities are smart when the ICTs of future Internet developments successfully
    embed the networks society needs for them to not only generate intellectual capital,
    or create wealth, but also cultivate the environmental capacity, ecology and vitality
    of those spaces which the direct democracy of their participatory governance open
    up, add value to and construct.

  abstract: The study analyses industry participation in FP6 and FP7, based on an
    extensive literature review, the analysis of CORDA data corroborated by a counterfactual
    evaluation, interviews with participants, case studies and feedback from an expert
    workshop. The results show that industry participation has increased with respect
    to previous programmes, for both large companies and SMEs, with a particular concentration
    on high-tech sectors. The key factors for participation, as well as the reasons
    behind the different levels in different themes, appear to be more related to
    the strategic alignment of the programme and companies’ priorities, than to operational
    issues such as administrative burden, success rates and participation costs. The
    study then presents the impact of FP on innovation, in terms of direct, indirect
    and behavioural additionality, and the related barriers, mainly related to the
    lack of flexibility during the project implementation. In terms of job creation,
    based on a counterfactual impact evaluation the results show that FP helped to
    create on average 2 new jobs per each company. Finally, conclusions and policy
    recommendations are presented, taking into account the innovations introduced
    by H2020

  abstract: The widespread availability of high-quality Web-based content offers new
    potential for supporting teachers as designers of curricula and classroom activities.
    When coupled with a participatory Web culture and infrastructure, teachers can
    share their creations as well as leverage from the best that their peers have
    to offer to support a collective intelligence or crowdsourcing community, which
    we dubcrowdteaching. We applied a collective intelligence framework to characterize
    crowdteaching in the context of a Web-based tool for teachers called the Instructional
    Architect (IA). The IA enables teachers to find, create, and share instructional
    activities (called IA projects) for their students using online learning resources.
    These IA projects can further be viewed, copied, or adapted by other IA users.
    This study examines the usage activities of two samples of teachers, and also
    analyzes the characteristics of a subset of their IA projects. Analyses of teacher
    activities suggest that they are engaging in crowdteaching processes. Teachers,
    on average, chose to share over half of their IA projects, and copied some directly
    from other IA projects. Thus, these teachers can be seen as both contributors
    to and consumers of crowdteaching processes. In addition, IA users preferred to
    view IA projects rather than to completely copy them. Finally, correlational results
    based on an analysis of the characteristics of IA projects suggest that several
    easily computed metrics (number of views, number of copies, and number of words
    in IA projects) can act as an indirect proxy of instructionally relevant indicators
    of the content of IA projects.

    Background: To date, health research literature has focused on social network sites (SNS) either as tools to deliver health care, to study the effect of these networks on behavior, or to analyze Web health content. Less is known about the effectiveness of these sites as a method for collecting data for health research and the means to use such powerful tools in health research.
    Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the available literature and explore the use of SNS as a mode of collecting data for health research. The review aims to answer four questions: Does health research employ SNS as method for collecting data? Is data quality affected by the mode of data collection? What types of participants were reached by SNS? What are the strengths and limitations of SNS?
    Methods: The literature was reviewed systematically in March 2013 by searching the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, using the Ovid and PubMed interface from 1996 to the third week of March 2013. The search results were examined by 2 reviewers, and exclusion, inclusion, and quality assessment were carried out based on a pre-set protocol.
    Results: The inclusion criteria were met by 10 studies and results were analyzed descriptively to answer the review questions. There were four main results. (1) SNS have been used as a data collection tool by health researchers; all but 1 of the included studies were cross-sectional and quantitative. (2) Data quality indicators that were reported include response rate, cost, timeliness, missing data/completion rate, and validity. However, comparison was carried out only for response rate and cost as it was unclear how other reported indicators were measured. (3) The most targeted population were females and younger people. (4) All studies stated that SNS is an effective recruitment method but that it may introduce a sampling bias.
    Conclusions: SNS has a role in health research, but we need to ascertain how to use it effectively without affecting the quality of research. The field of SNS is growing rapidly, and it is necessary to take advantage of the strengths of this tool and to avoid its limitations by effective research design. This review provides an important insight for scholars who plan to conduct research using SNS.

  abstract: This paper reviews the use of behavioural ideas to improve public policy.
    There needs to be a behavioural take on decision-making itself so that policies
    are designed in more effective ways. it recounts the beginnings of behavioural
    sciences as currently conceived and then setting out the massive expansion of
    interest that has come about since that time. It reports on how such ideas have
    had a large impact on governments at all levels across the world, but also noting
    how decision-making itself has been influenced by more policy-relevant ideas.
    The paper discusses the paradox that the very decision-makers themselves are subject
    to the same biases as the objects of behavioural economics, which might imply
    limitations in the choices of such interventions. Here the text of the chapter
    reengages with the classics of decision-making theory. The chapter notes how behavioural
    sciences need not depend on a top down approach but can incorporate citizen voice.
    The paper reviews how citizens and other groups can use behavioural cues to alter
    the behaviour of policy-makers in socially beneficial ways. The paper discusses
    how behaviourally informed measures could be integrated within the policy making
    process in ways that advance the effective use of evidence and nudge decision
    to make better policies.

  abstract: 'Does the digitization of land titles need to be framed within larger
    issues of Governance and move beyond narrow techno-administrative narratives?
    In doing so, what are the ranges of political economies that such interventions
    encounter and how do these relate to various forms of contests. What are readings
    of land titles digitization and its re-production in a variety of contexts of
    the ‘South’ and especially under conditions of globalization to contest with assumptions
    promoted by writers like Hernando De-Soto? This paper looks at the ‘Bhoomi program’
    and its consequence of digitizing land records in districts surrounding Bangalore.
    The Bhoomi program on the digitization of twenty million land records is considered
    a ‘best practice’ model of ‘e-governance’ to be replicated in other parts of India
    and elsewhere in poor countries. The main findings, at two levels, contrast conventional
    wisdom. First the digitization of land records led to increased corruption, much
    more bribes and substantially increased time taken for land transactions. At another
    level, it facilitated very large players in the land markets to capture vast quantities
    of land at a time when Bangalore experiences a boom in the land market. These
    consequences have come about via the centralization of both land records and management
    away from the village panchayat to the district level. The study comes out of
    detailed ethnographic research methods to detail out the process.

  abstract: We describe Quizz, a gamified crowdsourcing system that simultaneously
    assesses the knowledge of users and acquires new knowledge from them. Quizz operates
    by asking users to complete short quizzes on specific topics; as a user answers
    the quiz questions, Quizz estimates the user's competence. To acquire new knowledge,
    Quizz also incorporates questions for which we do not have a known answer; the
    answers given by competent users provide useful signals for selecting the correct
    answers for these questions. Quizz actively tries to identify knowledgeable users
    on the Internet by running advertising campaigns, effectively leveraging the targeting
    capabilities of existing, publicly available, ad placement services. Quizz quantifies
    the contributions of the users using information theory and sends feedback to
    the advertising system about each user. The feedback allows the ad targeting mechanism
    to further optimize ad placement. Our experiments, which involve over ten thousand
    users, confirm that we can crowdsource knowledge curation for niche and specialized
    topics, as the advertising network can automatically identify users with the desired
    expertise and interest in the given topic. We present controlled experiments that
    examine the effect of various incentive mechanisms, highlighting the need for
    having short-term rewards as goals, which incentivize the users to contribute.
    Finally, our cost-quality analysis indicates that the cost of our approach is
    below that of hiring workers through paid-crowdsourcing platforms, while offering
    the additional advantage of giving access to billions of potential users all over
    the planet, and being able to reach users with specialized expertise that is not
    typically available through existing labor marketplaces.

  abstract: Many governments have recently begun to adopt the concept of open innovation.
    However, studies on the openness of government data and its effect on the global
    competitiveness have not received much attention. Therefore, this study aims to
    investigate the effects of government data openness on a knowledge-based economy
    at the government level. The proposed model was analyzed using secondary data
    collected from three different reports. The findings indicate that government
    data openness positively affects the formation of knowledge bases in a country
    and that the level of knowledge base of a country positively affects the global
    competitiveness of a country.

    Big data society has changed the traditional forms of data analysis and created a new predictive approach to knowledge and investigation. In this light, it is necessary to consider the impact of this new paradigm on the traditional notion of data protection and its regulation.

    Focussing on the individual and communal dimension of data use, encompassing digital investigations, the authors outline the challenges that big data poses for individual information self-determination, reasonable suspicion and collective interests. Therefore, the article suggests some innovative proposals that may update the existing data protection legal framework and contribute to make it respondent to the present algorithmic society.

  abstract: "Cities hold considerable information, including details about the daily
    lives of residents and employees, maps of critical infrastructure, and records
    of the officials’ internal deliberations. Cities are beginning to realize that
    this data has economic and other value: If done wisely, the responsible release
    of city information can also release greater efficiency and innovation in the
    public and private sector. New services are cropping up that leverage open city
    data to great effect. \n\nMeanwhile, activist groups and individual residents
    are placing increasing pressure on state and local government to be more transparent
    and accountable, even as others sound an alarm over the privacy issues that inevitably
    attend greater data promiscuity. This takes the form of political pressure to
    release more information, as well as increased requests for information under
    the many public records acts across the country. \n\nThe result of these forces
    is that cities are beginning to open their data as never before. It turns out
    there is surprisingly little research to date into the important and growing area
    of municipal open data. This article is among the first sustained, cross-disciplinary
    assessments of an open municipal government system. We are a team of researchers

  abstract: |-
    Open government data (OGD) as a concept is gaining currency globally due to the strong advocacy of global organisations as Open Government Partnership. In recent years, there has been increased commitment on the part of national governments to proactively disclose information. However, much of the discussion on OGD is at the national level, especially in developing countries where commitments of proactive disclosure is conditioned by the commitments of national governments as expressed through the OGP national action plans. However, the local is important in the context of open data. In decentralized contexts, the local is where data is collected and stored, where there is strong feasibility that data will be published, and where data can generate the most impact when used. This synthesis paper wants to refocus the discussion of open government data in sub-national contexts by analysing nine country papers produced through the Open Data in Developing Countries research project.

    Using a common research framework that focuses on context, governance setting, and open data initiatives, the study found out that there is substantial effort on the part of sub-national governments to proactively disclose data, however, the design delimits citizen participation, and eventually, use. Second, context demands diff erent roles for intermediaries and diff erent types of initiatives to create an enabling environment for open data. Finally, data quality will remain a critical challenge for sub-national governments in developing countries and it will temper potential impact that open data will be able to generate.

  abstract: This article makes three related arguments. First, that although many
    definitions of the smart city have been proposed, corporate promoters say a smart
    city uses information technology to pursue efficient systems through real-time
    monitoring and control. Second, this definition is not new and equivalent to the
    idea of urban cybernetics debated in the 1970s. Third, drawing on a discussion
    of Rio de Janeiro’s Operations Center, I argue that viewing urban problems as
    wicked problems allows for more fundamental solutions than urban cybernetics,
    but requires local innovation and stakeholder participation. Therefore the last
    section describes institutions for municipal innovation and IT-enabled collaborative
    planning.

  abstract: The goal of this project was to determine how insights from mobile data
    might be used to maximum effect in support of policy planning and crisis response
    with minimal risk to privacy. The project aimed to determine the impact that aggregating
    mobile data to protect privacy has upon the utility of the data for (i) transportation
    planning and (ii) pandemic control and prevention. Utility of each data set was
    evaluated by surveying transportation experts and epidemiologists; re-identification
    risk for each data set was also assessed. Risk of re-identification was subsequently
    considered together with data utility to determine which level of aggregation
    is the minimum required to adequately protectindividual privacy while preserving
    its value for policy planning and crisis response. Results of the analysis indicate
    that the relationship between privacy risk and utility is complex and is highly
    dependent on the context and purpose of use. Nevertheless, there is a risk of
    reidentification in applying mobile data for public good, and a better understanding
    is needed of the critical thresholds for acceptable risk. This project lays the
    groundwork for development of evidence-based data standards and policy frameworks
    to ensure proportionality between the risk of harm resulting from misuse of mobile
    data and the risk of harm resulting from a failure to use it.

  abstract: Over the last century, state and local governments have been challenged
    to keep proactive, emergency planning efforts ahead of the after-the-disaster,
    response efforts. After moving from decentralized to centralized planning efforts,
    the most recent policy has returned to the philosophy that a decentralized planning
    approach is the most effective way to plan for a disaster. In fact, under the
    Obama administration, a policy of using the “whole community” approach to emergency
    planning has been adopted. This approach, however, creates an obvious problem
    for state and local government practitioners already under pressure for funding,
    time, and the continuous need for higher and broader expertise—the problem of
    how to actually incorporate the whole community into emergency planning efforts.
    This article suggests one such approach, crowdsourcing, as an option for local
    governments. The crowdsourcer-problem-crowd-platform-solution (CPCPS) model is
    suggested as an initial framework for practitioners seeking a practical application
    and basic comprehension. The model, discussion, and additional examples in this
    essay provide a skeletal framework for state and local governments wishing to
    reach the whole community while under the constraints of time, budget, and technical
    expertise.

    Crowdsourcing, itself a multidisciplinary field, can be well-served by incorporating theories and methods from affective computing. We present a various applications which are based on crowdsourcing. The direction of research on principles and methods can enable to solve a general problem via human computation systems. Crowdsourcing is nothing but an act of outsourcing tasks to a large group of people through an open request via the Internet. It has become popular among social scientists as a source to recruit research participants from the general public for studies. Crowdsourcing is introduced as the new online distributed problem solving model in which networked people collaborate to complete a task and produce the result. However, the idea of crowdsourcing is not new, and can be traced back to Charles Darwin. Darwin was interested in studying the universality of facial expressions in conveying emotions. For this, it required large amount of database and for this he had to consider a global population to get more general conclusions.

    This paper provides an introduction to crowdsourcing, guidelines for using crowdsourcing, and its applications in various fields. Finally, this article proposes conclusion which is based upon applications of crowdsourcing.

  abstract: 'In the mist of tightening budgets, many government agencies are being
    asked to deliver innovative solutions to operational and strategic problems. One
    way to address this dilemma is to participate in open innovation. This report
    addresses two key components of innovation: Adopting external ideas from private
    firms, universities, and individuals into the agency''s innovation practices;
    Pushing innovations developed internally to the public by reaching out to external
    channels.'

  abstract: Crowdsourcing has become a quick and efficient way to solve a wide variety
    of problems - technical solutions, social and economic actions, fundraising and
    troubleshooting of numerous issues that affect both the private and the public
    sectors. US government is now actively using crowdsourcing to solve complex problems
    that previously had to be handled by a limited circle of professionals. This paper
    outlines several examples of how a Department of Defense project headquartered
    at the National Defense University is using crowdsourcing for solutions to disaster
    response problems.

  abstract: 'The powerful potential of digital media to engage citizens in political
    actions has now crossed our news screens many times. But scholarly focus has tended
    to be on "networked," anti-institutional forms of collective action, to the neglect
    of advocacy and service organizations. This book investigates the changing fortunes
    of the citizen-civil society relationship by exploring how social changes and
    innovations in communication technology are transforming the information expectations
    and preferences of many citizens, especially young citizens. In doing so, it is
    the first work to bring together theories of civic identity change with research
    on civic organizations. Specifically, it argues that a shift in "information styles"
    may help to explain the disjuncture felt by many young people when it comes to
    institutional participation and politics. The book theorizes two paradigms of
    information style: a dutiful style, which was rooted in the society, communication
    system and citizen norms of the modern era, and an actualizing style, which constitutes
    the set of information practices and expectations of the young citizens of late
    modernity for whom interactive digital media are the norm. Hypothesizing that
    civil society institutions have difficulty adapting to the norms and practices
    of the actualizing information style, two empirical studies apply the dutiful/actualizing
    framework to innovative content analyses of organizations'' online communications-on
    their websites, and through Facebook. Results demonstrate that with intriguing
    exceptions, most major civil society organizations use digital media more in line
    with dutiful information norms than actualizing ones: they tend to broadcast strategic
    messages to an audience of receivers, rather than encouraging participation or
    exchange among an active set of participants. The book concludes with a discussion
    of the tensions inherent in bureaucratic organizations trying to adapt to an actualizing
    information style, and recommendations for how they may more successfully do so.'

  abstract: This chapter provides design lessons on how to take advantage of advances
    in information technologies that have enabled new governance infrastructures to
    become both possible and desirable. A governance infrastructure is the collection
    of technologies, people, policies, practices, resources, social norms, and information
    that interact to support governing activities. Smart governance infrastructures
    augment society's ability to organize, interact, and govern. Novel instances of
    smart governance infrastructures already exist and are regularly emerging in distributed
    organizations and online communities. As we think about rebooting the public square,
    this chapter is intended to challenge us to move beyond questions of how to best
    manage government institutions to questions of how to design governance systems
    with the appropriate incentives and rules to harness and coordinate the diversity,
    enthusiasm, and capabilities of those governed. We provide several design lessons
    learned from successful governance infrastructures and propose how they can be
    applied to address national priorities. This chapter anticipates how the interaction
    of technology and society can be leveraged to mindfully design problem-defined,
    participation-based governance infrastructures to return power to the people while
    increasing accountability and efficiency.

  abstract: 'In January 2014, the Centre for Information Policy Leadership (the Centre)
    launched a multiyear project on the risk-based approach to privacy: The Privacy
    Risk Framework Project. This project elaborates on the Centre’s earlier project
    on organisational accountability, particularly in seeking to develop the analytical
    framework and tools needed to implement certain key aspects of accountability.
    Specifically, the goals of this project are set forth in the following Project
    Vision Statement: Principle-based data privacy laws often leave room for interpretation,
    leaving it both to organisations to make appropriate decisions on how to implement
    these principles and to regulators on how to interpret and enforce the law. The
    Privacy Risk Framework Project aims to bridge the gap between high-level privacy
    principles on one hand, and compliance on the ground on the other, by developing
    a methodology for organisations to apply, calibrate and implement abstract privacy
    obligations based on the actual risks and benefits of the proposed data processing.
    While certain types of risk assessments are already an integral part of accountable
    organisations’ privacy management programs, they require further development.
    This project seeks to build consensus on what is meant by privacy risks to individuals
    (and society) and to create a practical framework to identify, prioritise and
    mitigate such risks so that principle-based privacy obligations can be implemented
    appropriately and effectively. On March 20, 2014, the Centre held a workshop in
    Paris during which more than 50 privacy experts, industry representatives and
    regulators discussed their experiences and views with respect to the risk-based
    approach to privacy, the privacy risk framework and methodology, as well as goals
    and next steps in this project. This paper, titled “A Risk-based Approach to Privacy:
    Improving Effectiveness in Practice”, is a developed version of the earlier discussion
    paper distributed to the participants of the workshop. It incorporates feedback
    from the Paris workshop and input received in subsequent consultations with Centre
    members and project participants.'

  abstract: 'Crowdsourcing design has been applied in various areas of graphic design,
    software design, and product design. This paper draws on those experiences and
    research in diversity, creativity and motivation to present a process model for
    crowdsourcing experience design. Crowdsourcing experience design for volunteer
    online communities serves two purposes: to increase the motivation of participants
    by making them stakeholders in the success of the project, and to increase the
    creativity of the design by increasing the diversity of expertise beyond experts
    in experience design. Our process model for crowdsourcing design extends the meta-design
    architecture, where for online communities is designed to be iteratively re-designed
    by its users. We describe how our model has been deployed and adapted to a citizen
    science project where nature preserve visitors can participate in the design of
    a system called NatureNet. The major contribution of this paper is a model for
    crowdsourcing experience design and a case study of how we have deployed it for
    the design and development of NatureNet.'

  abstract: A number of governments worldwide employ web-based e-consultation platforms
    to enable stakeholders commenting on draft legislation. Stakeholders’ input includes
    arguing in favour or against the proposed legislation as well as proposing alternative
    ideas. In this paper, we empirically investigate the relationship between the
    volume of contributions in these platforms and the amount of new ideas that are
    generated. This enables us to determine whether participants in such platforms
    keep generating new ideas or just recycle a finite number of ideas. We capitalised
    on argumentation models to code and analyse a large number of draft law consultations
    published in opengov.gr, the official e-consultation platform for draft legislation
    in Greece. Our results suggest that as the number of posts grows, the number of
    new ideas continues to increase. The results of this study improve our understanding
    of the dynamics of these consultations and enable us to design better platforms.

    Today, governments have access to a variety of tools to successfully implement agency programs. For example, Data Analytics—especially of financial data—can be used to better inform decision making by ensuring agencies have the information they need at the point of time that it can be most effective. In addition, governments at all levels can more effectively address risks using new Risk Management approaches. And finally, Shared Services can not only save money, but also stimulate innovation, improve decisionmaking, and increase the quality of services expected by citizens.

    The IBM Center has published a variety of reports related to these topics and accordingly, we have brought key findings on these topics together in the compilation that follows. We welcome your thoughts on these issues, and look forward to a continued dialogue with government leaders and stakeholders on actions to help agencies achieve their mission effectively and efficiently.

  abstract: Big data is ubiquitous but heterogeneous. Big data can be used to tally
    clicks and traffic on web pages, find patterns in stock trades, track consumer
    preferences, identify linguistic correlations in large corpuses of texts. This
    book examines big data not as an undifferentiated whole but contextually, investigating
    the varied challenges posed by big data for health, science, law, commerce, and
    politics. Taken together, the chapters reveal a complex set of problems, practices,
    and policies. The advent of big data methodologies has challenged the theory-driven
    approach to scientific knowledge in favor of a data-driven one. Social media platforms
    and self-tracking tools change the way we see ourselves and others. The collection
    of data by corporations and government threatens privacy while promoting transparency.
    Meanwhile, politicians, policy makers, and ethicists are ill-prepared to deal
    with big data’s ramifications. The contributors look at big data’s effect on individuals
    as it exerts social control through monitoring, mining, and manipulation; big
    data and society, examining both its empowering and its constraining effects;
    big data and science, considering issues of data governance, provenance, reuse,
    and trust; and big data and organizations, discussing data responsibility, “data
    harm,” and decision making.

  abstract: Natural disasters affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide every
    year. Emergency response efforts depend upon the availability of timely information,
    such as information concerning the movements of affected populations. The analysis
    of aggregated and anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) captured from the mobile
    phone infrastructure provides new possibilities to characterize human behavior
    during critical events. In this work, we investigate the viability of using CDR
    data combined with other sources of information to characterize the floods that
    occurred in Tabasco, Mexico in 2009. An impact map has been reconstructed using
    Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within this frame, the underlying communication
    activity signals in the CDR data have been analyzed and compared against rainfall
    levels extracted from data of the NASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number
    of active phones connected to each cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns
    in the most affected locations during and after the floods that could be used
    as signatures of the floods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment
    and population information awareness. The representativeness of the analysis has
    been assessed using census data and civil protection records. While a more extensive
    validation is required, these early results suggest high potential in using cell
    tower activity information to improve early warning and emergency management mechanisms.

  abstract: Massive volumes of data are increasingly being generated at unprecedented
    rates as a result of advances in information technology and developments such
    as use of expanded mobile capabilities (supported by more powerful and increasingly
    widespread bandwidth). New approaches to combining and “making sense of” large
    amounts of varied data—methods referred to as advanced analytics—are helping to
    uncover patterns, identify anomalies, and provide insights not suggested by a
    priori hypotheses. In fact, advanced algorithms are enabling the automation of
    functions that require the ability to reason; for example, an algorithm may use
    data on weather, traffic, and roadways to estimate and provide real-time information
    to drivers on traffic delays and congestion. At the January 2016 forum, participants
    from industry, government, academia and nonprofit organizations considered potential
    implications of these developments. Their discussion of emerging forms of data,
    analytics, and innovation pointed to a combined process or cycle in which relevant
    data are generated and subjected to analysis, so that results can be applied to
    innovative decision making or uses. We term this process “data and analytics innovation.”
    Consideration of related impacts spanned the economy and society, and included
    new opportunities with accompanying challenges, as well as potentially negative
    impacts. Following the forum, participants reviewed a summary of forum discussions,
    and two experts (who did not attend the forum) independently reviewed a draft
    of this report. The report does not necessarily represent the views of any individual
    participant or organization.

  abstract: 'Crowdsourcing is an emerging technology where innovation and production
    are sourced out to the public through an open call. At the center of crowdsourcing
    is a resource allocation problem: there is an abundance of workers but a scarcity
    of high skills, and an easy task assigned to a high-skill worker is a waste of
    resources. This problem is complicated by the fact that the exact difficulties
    of innovation tasks may not be known in advance, so tasks that require high-skill
    labor cannot be identified and allocated ahead of time. We show that the solution
    to this problem takes the form of a skill hierarchy, where tasks are first attempted
    by low-skill labor, and high skill workers only engage with a task if less skilled
    workers are unable to finish it. This hierarchy can be constructed and implemented
    in a decentralized manner even though neither the difficulties of the tasks nor
    the skills of the candidate workers are known. We provide a dynamic pricing mechanism
    that achieves this implementation by inducing workers to self-select into different
    layers. The mechanism is simple: each time a task is attempted and not finished,
    its price (reward upon completion) goes up.'

  abstract: In 2012, New York City Council passed legislation to make government data
    open and freely available to the public. By approving this legislation, City Council
    was attempting to make local government more transparent, accountable, and streamlined
    in its operations. It was also attempting to create economic opportunities and
    to encourage the public to identify ways in which to improve government and local
    communities. The purpose of this study is to explore public uses of New York City
    open data. Currently, more than 1300 datasets covering broad areas such as health,
    education, transportation, public safety, housing and business are available on
    the City’s Open Data Portal. This study found a plethora of maps, visualizations,
    tools, apps and analyses made by the public using New York City open data. Indeed,
    open data is inspiring a productive range of creative reuses yet questions remain
    concerning how useable the data is for users without technical skills and resources.

  abstract: 'This study of the diffusion and evolution of the 311 innovation in the
    form of citizen service centers and as a technology cluster has been designed
    to help identify the catalysts for the spread of government-to-citizen (G2C) technology
    in local government in order to better position future G2C technology for a more
    rapid rate of adoption. The 311 non-emergency number was first established in
    1996 and had spread to 80 local governments across the United States by 2012.
    This dissertation examines: what factors contributed to the adoption of 311 in
    American local governments over 100,000 in population; how did the innovation
    diffuse and evolve over time; and why did some governments’ communications with
    citizens became more advanced than others?'

  abstract: |-
    This book critically explores forms and techniques of calculation that emerge with digital computation, and their implications. The contributors demonstrate that digital calculative devices matter beyond their specific functions as they progressively shape, transform and govern all areas of our life. In particular, it addresses such questions as:

    -How does the drive to make sense of, and productively use, large amounts of diverse data, inform the development of new calculative devices, logics and techniques?
    -How do these devices, logics and techniques affect our capacity to decide and to act?
    -How do mundane elements of our physical and virtual existence become data to be analysed and rearranged in complex ensembles of people and things?
    -In what ways are conventional notions of public and private, individual and population, certainty and probability, rule and exception transformed and what are the consequences?
    -How does the search for ‘hidden’ connections and patterns change our understanding of social relations and associative life?
    -Do contemporary modes of calculation produce new thresholds of calculability and computability, allowing for the improbable or the merely possible to be embraced and acted upon?
    -As contemporary approaches to governing uncertain futures seek to anticipate future events, how are calculation and decision engaged anew?

    Drawing together different strands of cutting-edge research that is both theoretically sophisticated and empirically rich, this book makes an important contribution to several areas of scholarship, including the emerging social science field of software studies, and will be a vital resource for students and scholars alike.
