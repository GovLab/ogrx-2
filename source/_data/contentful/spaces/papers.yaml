  abstract: New, “big” data sources allow measurement of city characteristics and
    outcome variables higher frequencies and finer geographic scales than ever before.
    However, big data will not solve large urban social science questions on its own.
    Big data has the most value for the study of cities when it allows measurement
    of the previously opaque, or when it can be coupled with exogenous shocks to people
    or place. We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they
    can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google
    Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting
    that similar image data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured
    areas of the developing world. We then discuss how survey techniques can be improved
    to better measure willingness to pay for urban amenities. Finally, we explain
    how Internet data is being used to improve the quality of city services.

  abstract: |-
    Social media are now widely used for political protests, campaigns, and communication in developed and developing nations, but available research has not yet paid sufficient attention to experiences beyond the US and UK. This collection tackles this imbalance head-on, compiling cutting-edge research across six continents to provide a comprehensive, global, up-to-date review of recent political uses of social media.

    Drawing together empirical analyses of the use of social media by political movements and in national and regional elections and referenda, The Routledge Companion to Social Media and Politics presents studies ranging from Anonymous and the Arab Spring to the Greek Aganaktismenoi, and from South Korean presidential elections to the Scottish independence referendum. The book is framed by a selection of keystone theoretical contributions, evaluating and updating existing frameworks for the social media age.

  abstract: 'In the last 15 years, European countries have invested considerable resources
    to provide e-government services. Despite of its increasing availability, its
    level of adoption has not been satisfying. On the other hand, over the last years,
    coinciding with the web 2.0 trend, the e-government services co-produced by citizens
    start to appear, often without the support, acknowledgement and even awareness
    of the government. This trend stems from a well-established tradition of offline
    co- production of public services, i.e. services provided by the voluntary sector,
    but brought to an unprecedented scale thanks to the advent of web 2.0. Still,
    the concept remains not well-defined and its impact is not yet well studied. The
    paper explores on a limited sets of cases what does it mean to collaboratively
    deliver online public services; what are the success factors based on the cases
    under study and what are the incentives for service providers (other than public
    administration), citizens as users and public administration. The authors propose
    an ostensive definition of the collaborative delivery of public services: collaborative
    public services are created and run by government, civil society or by private
    sector building on the re-use of government data or citizens data. Those services
    are focused on public goods delivery (e.g. health, education, public transport)
    and are meant to change the traditional government services by engaging in an
    open dialogue with public administration about the best way to deliver those services.
    The analysis of six case studies of innovative collaborative online public services
    suggests that the online collaborative public service delivery increases its quality
    with the users׳ growth contrary to the traditional offline service delivery. The
    study results indicate that the current developers interest lies in delivering
    complementary services to the government run services rather than substitutive
    services. The authors propose also the initial list of success factors, enabling
    conditions, and benefits for all main stakeholders (users, innovators and public
    administration).'

  abstract: In the spirit of Jeremy Bentham's Political Tactics, this volume offers
    the first comprehensive discussion of the effects of secrecy and publicity on
    debates and votes in committees and assemblies. The contributors – sociologists,
    political scientists, historians, and legal scholars – consider the micro-technology
    of voting (the devil is in the detail), the historical relations between the secret
    ballot and universal suffrage, the use and abolition of secret voting in parliamentary
    decisions, and the sometimes perverse effects of the drive for greater openness
    and transparency in public affairs. The authors also discuss the normative questions
    of secret versus public voting in national elections and of optimal mixes of secrecy
    and publicity, as well as the opportunities for strategic behavior created by
    different voting systems. Together with two previous volumes on Collective Wisdom
    (Cambrige, 2012) and Majority Decisions (Cambridge, 2014), the book sets a new
    standard for interdisciplinary work on collective decision-making.

  abstract: |-
    Following a promising and already well established trend, in February 2014 the Office of the President of Mexico launched its open data portal (datos.gob.mx). This diagnostic – carried out between July and September of 2015 – is designed to brief international donors and stakeholders such as members of the Open Government Partnership Steering Committee, provides the reader with contextual information to understand the state of supply and demand for open data from the portal, and the specific challenges the Mexican government is facing in its quest to implement the policy.

    The insights offered through data proessing and interviews with key stakeholders indicate the need to promote: i) A sense of ownership of datos.gob.mx by the user community, but particularly by the officials in charge of implementing the policy within each government unit; ii) The development of tools and mechanisms to increase the quality of the data provided through the portal; and iii) Civic hacking of the portal to promote innovation, and a sense of appropriation that would increase the policy's long-term resilience to partisan and leadership change.

  abstract: Facing general conceptions of the power effects of big data, this thematic
    edition is interested in studies that scrutinise big data and power in concrete
    fields of application. It brings together scholars from different disciplines
    who analyse the fields agriculture, education, border control and consumer policy.
    As will be made explicit in the following, each of the articles tells us something
    about firstly, what big data is and how it relates to power. They secondly also
    shed light on how we should shape “the big data society” and what research questions
    need to be answered to be able to do so.

  abstract: In recent years the necessity for governments to develop new public values
    of openness and transparency, and thereby increase their citizenries' sense of
    inclusiveness, and their trust in and confidence about their governments, has
    risen to the point of urgency. The decline of trust in governments, especially
    in developing countries, has been unprecedented and continuous. A new paradigm
    that signifies a shift to citizen-driven initiatives over and above state- and
    market-centric ones calls for innovative thinking that requires openness in government.
    The need for this new synergy notwithstanding, Open Government cannot be considered
    truly open unless it also enhances citizen participation and engagement. The Ghana
    Open Data Initiative (GODI) project strives to create an open data community that
    will enable government (supply side) and civil society in general (demand side)
    to exchange data and information. We argue that the GODI is too narrowly focused
    on the supply side of the project, and suggest that it should generate an even
    platform to improve interaction between government and citizens to ensure a balance
    in knowledge sharing with and among all constituencies.

  abstract: The global landscape in the supply, co-creation and use of geospatial
    data is changing very rapidly with new satellites, sensors and mobile devices
    reconfiguring the traditional lines of demand and supply and the number of actors
    involved. In this paper we chart some of these technology-led developments and
    then focus on the opportunities they have created for the increased participation
    of the public in generating and contributing information for a wide range of uses,
    scientific and non. Not all this information is open or geospatial, but sufficiently
    large portions of it are to make it one of the most significant phenomena of the
    last decade. In fact, we argue that while satellite and sensors have exponentially
    increased the volumes of geospatial information available, the participation of
    the public is transformative because it expands the range of participants and
    stakeholders in society using and producing geospatial information, with opportunities
    for more direct participation in science, politics and social action.

  abstract: 'The private sector is transforming at record speed for the digital economy.
    As recently as 2008, when America elected President Obama, most large companies
    had separate IT departments, which were seen as just that—departments—separate
    from the heart of the business. Now, as wireless networks connect the planet,
    and entire companies exist in the cloud, digital technology is no longer viewed
    as another arrow in the corporate quiver, but rather the very foundation upon
    which all functions are built. This, then, is the mark of the digital era: in
    order to remain successful, modern enterprises must both leverage digital technology
    and develop a culture that values its significance within the organization.'

  abstract: "Over the last few years, the Government of British Columbia (Canada)
    has initiated a variety of practices and policies aimed at providing more legitimate
    and effective governance. Leveraging advances in technology, the Government of
    British Columbia (BC) has focused on changing the way it engages with its citizens
    with the goal of changing the way it seeks input and develops and implements policy.
    The efforts are part of a broader trend among a wide variety of democratic governments
    to re-imagine public service and governance. \n\nThe goal of this report is to:
    Outline and benchmark the current state of the BC Government’s efforts in improving
    transparency, citizen engagement and streamlined service delivery; Inspire BC
    officials how to build upon the existing foundation by pointing to worthwhile
    practices and policies drawn from case studies and reflections of current practitioners
    and thinkers in the field. \n\nFor this report, we identified two central themes
    to position BC’s efforts. For each theme, the report provides an account of what
    BC is currently doing - benchmarking it with other jurisdictions."
