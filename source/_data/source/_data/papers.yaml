  abstract: This book presents cutting edge research on the new ethical challenges
    posed by biomedical Big Data technologies and practices. ‘Biomedical Big Data’
    refers to the analysis of aggregated, very large datasets to improve medical knowledge
    and clinical care. The book describes the ethical problems posed by aggregation
    of biomedical datasets and re-use/re-purposing of data, in areas such as privacy,
    consent, professionalism, power relationships, and ethical governance of Big Data
    platforms. Approaches and methods are discussed that can be used to address these
    problems to achieve the appropriate balance between the social goods of biomedical
    Big Data research and the safety and privacy of individuals. Seventeen original
    contributions analyse the ethical, social and related policy implications of the
    analysis and curation of biomedical Big Data, written by leading experts in the
    areas of biomedical research, medical and technology ethics, privacy, governance
    and data protection. The book advances our understanding of the ethical conundrums
    posed by biomedical Big Data, and shows how practitioners and policy-makers can
    address these issues going forward.

    This investigation was undertaken in order to determine some best practices for
    planning and conducting public consultations (PC), community engagement (CE) sessions,
    and similar activities. In partnering with the Peterborough Social Planning Council (PSPC)
    and the Peterborough County-City Health Unit (PCCHU) I have complied data on current PC
    and CE practices used by governments and large scale NGOs.

  abstract: |-
    Countless people around the world harness the affordances of digital media to enable democratic participation, coordinate disaster relief, campaign for policy change, and strengthen local advocacy groups. The world watched as activists used social media to organize protests during the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Hong Kong’s Umbrella Revolution. Many governmental and community organizations changed their mission and function as they adopted new digital tools and practices. This book examines the use of “civic media”—the technologies, designs, and practices that support connection through common purpose in civic, political, and social life. Scholars from a range of disciplines and practitioners from a variety of organizations offer analyses and case studies that explore the theory and practice of civic media.

    The contributors set out the conceptual context for the intersection of civic and media; examine the pressure to innovate and the sustainability of innovation; explore play as a template for resistance; look at civic education; discuss media-enabled activism in communities; and consider methods and funding for civic media research. The case studies that round out each section range from a “debt resistance” movement to government service delivery ratings to the “It Gets Better” campaign aimed at combating suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer youth. The book offers a valuable interdisciplinary dialogue on the challenges and opportunities of the increasingly influential space of civic media.

  abstract: The editors of Governance have asked me to assess the extent and nature
    of change in the governing process since the origins of the journal 30 years ago.
    This is an engaging task but a difficult one. It is difficult because trend lines
    rarely have a definitive beginning point—or at least if similar tendencies are
    seen across national boundaries, they rarely begin at the same time. It is also
    difficult because states and nations have different traditions and may be more
    or less willing to accept lessons from elsewhere. As well, national entities and
    even regional ones may react differently to similar problems. Old Europe, as Donald
    Rumsfeld the former U.S. Defense Secretary once disparagingly referred to the
    more democratically stable and prosperous countries of Western Europe, still seems
    more likely to adhere to globalization, freedom of movement across national borders,
    and at least some tolerance of immigration than has been the case in the Eastern
    and Central parts of the continent or, for that matter, in the United States.

  abstract: 'Private provision of public goods is typically associated with three
    main problems: (1) high organization costs, (2) the assurance problem, and (3)
    the free-rider problem. We argue that technologies which enable crowdfunding (the
    method of funding projects by raising small amounts of money from a large number
    of people via the internet), have made the overall conditions for private provision
    of public goods more favorable: these technologies lowered the organization costs
    and enabled to employ more efficient mechanisms which reduce the assurance and
    free-rider problems. It follows that if the reason for government provision of
    public goods is higher efficiency as suggested by the standard theory, then with
    the emergence of crowdfunding we should observe a decline of the government role
    in this area.'

  abstract: 'Two parallel phenomena are gaining attention in human–computer interaction
    research: gamification and crowdsourcing. Because crowdsourcing''s success depends
    on a mass of motivated crowdsourcees, crowdsourcing platforms have increasingly
    been imbued with motivational design features borrowed from games; a practice
    often called gamification. While the body of literature and knowledge of the phenomenon
    have begun to accumulate, we still lack a comprehensive and systematic understanding
    of conceptual foundations, knowledge of how gamification is used in crowdsourcing,
    and whether it is effective. We first provide a conceptual framework for gamified
    crowdsourcing systems in order to understand and conceptualize the key aspects
    of the phenomenon. The paper''s main contributions are derived through a systematic
    literature review that investigates how gamification has been examined in different
    types of crowdsourcing in a variety of domains. This meticulous mapping, which
    focuses on all aspects in our framework, enables us to infer what kinds of gamification
    efforts are effective in different crowdsourcing approaches as well as to point
    to a number of research gaps and lay out future research directions for gamified
    crowdsourcing systems. Overall, the results indicate that gamification has been
    an effective approach for increasing crowdsourcing participation and the quality
    of the crowdsourced work; however, differences exist between different types of
    crowdsourcing: the research conducted in the context of crowdsourcing of homogenous
    tasks has most commonly used simple gamification implementations, such as points
    and leaderboards, whereas crowdsourcing implementations that seek diverse and
    creative contributions employ gamification with a richer set of mechanics.'

  abstract: 'Can Crowds serve as useful allies in policy design? How do non-expert
    Crowds perform relative to experts in the assessment of policy measures? Does
    the geographic location of non-expert Crowds, with relevance to the policy context,
    alter the performance of non-experts Crowds in the assessment of policy measures?
    In this work, we investigate these questions by undertaking experiments designed
    to replicate expert policy assessments with non-expert Crowds recruited from Virtual
    Labor Markets. We use a set of ninety-six climate change adaptation policy measures
    previously evaluated by experts in the Netherlands as our control condition to
    conduct experiments using two discrete sets of non-expert Crowds recruited from
    Virtual Labor Markets. We vary the composition of our non-expert Crowds along
    two conditions: participants recruited from a geographical location directly relevant
    to the policy context and participants recruited at-large. We discuss our research
    methods in detail and provide the findings of our experiments.'

    Open Policy is when governments, institutions, and non-profits enact policies and legislation that makes content, knowledge, or data they produce or fund available under a permissive license to allow reuse, revision, remix, retention, and redistribution. This promotes innovation, access, and equity in areas of education, data, software, heritage, cultural content, science, and academia.

    For several years, Creative Commons has been tracking the spread of open policies around the world. And now, with the new Global Open Policy Report (PDF) by the Open Policy Network, we’re able to provide a systematic overview of open policy development.

    screen-shot-2016-12-02-at-5-57-09-pmThe first-of-its-kind report gives an overview of open policies in 38 countries, across four sectors: education, science, data and heritage. The report includes an Open Policy Index and regional impact and local case studies from Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, Latin America, Europe, and North America. The index measures open policy strength on two scales: policy strength and scope, and level of policy implementation. The index was developed by researchers from CommonSphere, a partner organization of CC Japan.

  abstract: Online deliberation may provide a more cost-effective and/or less inhibiting
    environment for public participation than face to face (F2F). But do online methods
    bias participation toward certain individuals or groups? We compare F2F versus
    online participation in an experiment affording within-participants and cross-modal
    comparisons. For English speakers required to have Internet access as a condition
    of participation, we find no negative effects of online modes on equality of participation
    (EoP) related to gender, age, or educational level. Asynchronous online discussion
    appears to improve EoP for gender relative to F2F. Data suggest a dampening effect
    of online environments on black participants, as well as amplification for whites.
    Synchronous online voice communication EoP is on par with F2F across individuals.
    But individual-level EoP is much lower in the online forum, and greater online
    forum participation predicts greater F2F participation for individuals. Measured
    rates of participation are compared to self-reported experiences, and other findings
    are discussed.
